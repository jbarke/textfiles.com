You have a           good variety of stuff in here.  I do have a request - keep it clean.            My BBS does not carry adult files, and we have one game that is adult           oriented (Bordello) but I consider that "tame" compared to some of the          adult games out there.  I want all my subscribers to be able to enjoy           ATW, no matter how old (or young!).

Adult oriented material will not appear           in this magazine unless it pertains to science/medical related                  material.

Congrats on your first ish. Nice, informative stuff. The articles               were a tad dry in tone, but interesting nonetheless. What surprised me          however, was how the "editor's letter to readers" commented on how he           was sick of seeing all these internet magazines all on the same topics          and your first issue seemed to bear almost solely on the subject of             astronomy and the space program. Please add variety in the future. I            hope that, if you do this, it will not detract from the depth of                articles. Good luck in all your endeavors.                                      -Joe Zarrow Herndon, Va                                                                                                                                         RESPONSE FROM: Ken Regenfuse                                                                                                                                    Joe, you are absolutely right. We sorta did get carried away with space and     science articles. I have to blame that one on Tom. He is a space and            science fiction fanatic. I am glad to see that you agreed with my point         of view, but seriously, we will do our best in the future to offer a vast       variety of articles that interests all of our readers from children to          senior citizens that are not dry and boring, but also keeps your interest       until you finish reading the entire article. Thanks for the comment and         the compliment. I hope you continue to enjoy our efforts.

All the comments that we have received thus far have been          positive and encouraging. The written comments that we have received have       been answered and will appear in this issue. I would like to take this          time to encourage all of our readers to send us your comments. Your likes,      dislikes, and what you, as a reader, would like to see in future issues of      Across The Wire. Our goal is to make Across The Wire magazine the best          BBS magazine in the world. A lot of that goal depends upon you, the reader.     Without your input we, as the editors, have no idea of your tastes. We have     no idea if a certain article may offend someone out there in cyberland, or      if there was an article that you loved and would like to see more of. Our       main goal is to include approxamately 100 plus articles in each and every       issue. After much discussion we felt this was a good number to attract          any and all users. I don't expect our readers to read all the articles          in any one issue. I know when I pick up a magazine, I only read the articles    in that magazine that interest me. By offering a vast number of articles        and topics to read we feel we can attract all users to read something of        interest to them and at the same time not over burden that user with tons       of articles on any one subject. By offering 100 plus articles each month        in the magazine not only will we be the largest BBS magazine out, as far as     we know, but we will also accomplish our goal of offering a vast variety        to all our readers.                                                                                                                                               To all the BBS sysops that have already decided to carry our magazine,        we wish to thank you for your early support. I personally hope that the         magazine helps your BBS's to grow and attract readers and users of all          ages. Remember you, as sysops, also play an important role in making our        magazine a success. It is important that you get those comments up to us        that either you or your readers leave so we may continue to improve our         magazine and make it as fine a magazine as possible.

Gill                                        ======================================================================                                                                                            Computers have a down side.  They're expensive.  And they grow.                                                                                                 Start out with a simple computer.  You get software that needs                a new device.  It doesn't make sense to have that expensive device              for just one piece of software, so you get new software.  At least              one of the new programs needs a device you don't have.  And the cycle           starts again.  I know.  It's happened to me --                                                                                                                    I started out using a PCjr with expanded memory (that's another               story).  It wasn't very satisfactory.                                                                                                                             About a year ago I had a chance to buy a 'discontinued' 486 IBM               compatible with an 82 meg hard drive.  No sound card, no CD-ROM                 drive, but it sure beats a PCjr.  Even one on steroids.                                                                                                           The 486 had DOS, Windows, and Works for Windows already installed.            I picked up Sim City 2000 and Oregon Trail ("for the kids").                                                                                                      Then my family walked through the Mall of America.  Impressive                place.  My oldest daughter had some money she'd earned.  Now she had            a program called Jurassic Art.  I had a program called Lloyd that I             figured the younger kids would like.                                                                                                                              We were on the other side of the Cities and heading for home when             I read the fine print on Lloyd's box.  The thing needed a sound card.                                                                                             So I bought a sound card.  A Sound Blaster 16.                                                                                                                  Lloyd worked fine, and now we could hear music in the other two               games.  Sound Blaster came with some really interesting software, and           I started exploring that.                                                                                                                                         About this time I bought some (fairly) inexpensive speakers.  It              made sense:  The software and sound card worked better with a better            output device.                                                                                                                                                    Have you noticed how software eats up hard drive space?  By late              last year I was down to 3 or 4 meg available.  And that was after               removing Oregon Trail and Jurassic Art.                                                                                                                           So I bought a new hard drive.  428 meg.  Oregon Trail and Jurassic            Art are back on.  So are some other nifty programs.  There is still             plenty of room on the new hard drive.  Does this mean that the cycle            is over?                                                                                                                                                          Yesterday I got a CD-ROM disk in the mail.                                                                                                                      Brian H.

This little discourse is an attempt to                help the layman, of which I'm one, find and correct those                       atrocious cases of noise which might over come even the best                    modem.  My background and expertise for writing this comes from                 many years in the USAF working in a related field.                                                                                                              INTRODUCTION:                                                                                                                                                   	Probably, at one time or another, everyone who has ever used                   a modem has vehemently cursed "line noise" and then resigned                    themselves to the fact that there is nothing they can do to                     change it.  WRONG!  "Line Noise" is just another form of EMI and                I hope to show, in this little report, where it comes from, how                 you can check for it, and even how to control it.                                                                                                               	Regardless of whether you call it EMI (Electro Magnetic                        Interference), RFI (Radio Frequency Interference), noise, or some               other obscenity, it all boils down to one thing:  Trouble for the               communicator.  Furthermore, what's really disconcerting is, to                  one degree or another, IT'S EVERYWHERE!                                                                                                                         SOME BACKGROUND INFO:                                                                                                                                           	I prefer the acronym EMI because virtually EVERY device that                   operates on electricity does create some electromagnetic fields.                Specifically, anytime that an electric current is passed through                a wire (or any other conductive medium), electromagnetic fields                 are generated.  The strength of these fields varies with the                    voltage and current being passed - something like an electric                   blanket is so negligible that it can be ignored; older                          televisions with their high voltages and unshielded screens can                 be awful.  The list of what's good and what's bad is far too                    lengthy for inclusion here; still, a little common sense and                    thought says that things like refrigerator compressors, vacuum                  cleaners, vcr's, tv's, sewing machines, pumps, etc make a lot of                noise!  However, sometimes, they make even more noise than they                 are supposed to. For instance, a compressor that is not working                 efficiently will be prone to generate even more EMI than it                     should.  In the case of a refrigerator, this is doubly bad                      because, aside from the EMI that you have to contend with, you                  are probably getting diminished cooling efficiency and thus                     increased electrical usage = a bigger utility bill.  Therefore,                 control of EMI pays off in more benefits than just a better modem               connection.                                                                                                                                                     	Of course, the most natural way to detect EMI is to lose                       connection when Granny's old washing machine kicks over to spin                 cycle and throws a barrage of broad spectrum noise all over the                 phone line... and that about 15 minutes into a 20 minute long                   distance download of that file you've wanted for the last six                   months.  However, the BEST way to find out if you have some EMI                 problems is the look for them BEFORE they cause trouble.  And,                  here's the good part - you do NOT have to be an expert or own a                 lot of fancy equipment to go EMI hunting.                                                                                                                       	Now, before I go into more detail about how to go on your                      EMI hunt, I want to tell you a little more about it.  Earlier I                 mentioned that the strength of EMI depends on voltage and                       current; EMI also has another characteristic - frequency.  The                  Radio Frequency (RF) on which the EMI is broadcast will vary                    according to the wavelength of its propagator and some other                    factors; however, there is no need to go into all the deep                      technical details of EMI.  The main thrust here is to identify                  that EMI might be present at one RF and not at another.  Thus,                  your EMI hunt will have to be conducted on two planes - one                     spatial and one spectral.  About the only good thing here is that               modem communications seem to be most adversely affected by EMI in               the lower RF bands.  So, although it would be nice to have a very               sensitive, multi-band, broad spectrum, tune-able receiver (which                costs lotsa money), a simple battery powered, AM pocket radio                   will do the job.                                                                                                                                                	Just a couple observations about your little radio -                           remember, it is not very sensitive and the RF range is rather                   limited.  So, any EMI that you find should be considered a                      potential hazard because there is likely to be a stronger signal                somewhere else on another frequency.                                                                                                                            RUNNING THE TEST:                                                                                                                                               	Actually, I recommend four separate tests; one inside the                      house, one outside the house, one where you examine individual                  devices such as tv's, refrigerators, microwaves, etc., and one                  where you check along the route of the lines to your                            computer/modem.                                                                                                                                                                       Individual Appliances                                                                                                                     	So that you'll get a feel for the sort of signals to look                      for, we'll discuss testing individual devices first; and, the                   best example that nearly everyone has is a TV.                                                                                                                  1.  With the TV off, place your radio in front of the TV about                  two feet from the screen.                                                                                                                                       2.  Turn your radio on and tune it to where there is only static;               best results will probably be somewhere between 600 kilocycles                  and 1000 kilocycles.  Adjust the volume to a comfortable level.                                                                                                 3.  Turn on the TV and you should immediately hear a buzzing,                   motor-boating sound.  You might try to tune the radio a little                  for optimum reception.  If you have doubts about whether or not                 this specific signal is coming from the TV, turn it off and on a                couple times and note whether or not the signal goes away each                  time you turn off the TV.  If it does, you can bet you've found                 your first source of EMI.                                                                                                                                       4.  By moving your radio around the TV you can determine roughly                from where the strongest signals are coming.                                                                                                                    	As you move from appliance to appliance you'll learn the                       different sounds associated with each.  Also, for some of the                   devices, you'll have to run more than one test.  The VCR, for                   example, should be tested three times - once with it just on,                   once with it in Play mode, and once with it in Record mode.                     Perhaps this needs to be stressed:  Any device that has more than               one mode of operation should be tested for each mode.  For                      example, I have a clean air system that has two modes of                        operation and each mode has two settings - Hi and Lo.  With the                 Ionizer off, it's not too bad; however, when I turn on the                      Ionizer, even in the low mode, it throws out as much EMI as an                  old, unshielded TV - different RF and different type signal,                    none-the-less, it makes a lot of EMI!                                                                                                                           	One last thing on the subject of testing the individual                        devices; keep good notes and maybe even make a little sketch or                 diagram - you can use this data later when you start trying to                  eliminate or minimize the effects of the EMI that you've found.                                                                                                                         Inside the House                                                                                                                        	After you have examined the individual devices, it's a good                    idea to just tour the house with the radio on checking from room                to room; you may have over looked something, or you may find                    something that did not show up on any of the specific appliances.               If you have more than one floor, be sure to check carefully                     directly above and below your computer/modem because something                  could be throwing a signal down or up and you might not have                    noticed it earlier.                                                                                                                                                                     Outside the House                                                                                                                       	Now, you're probably gonna look a little peculiar to the                       neighbors while walking around the outside of the house pointing                a little cheap radio at everything; but, this is a good way to                  check for the really serious external sources.  Do you have a                   Heat Pump?  Check it!  Is there anything like a sump pump?  Check               it!  Make several checks at different times of day/night.  If you               find something that you suspect is related to the electrical or                 telephone lines, you might call that particular service provider                and ask them to do an evaluation because nearly all power and                   phone companies have investigative teams just for this purpose.                                                                                                                          Along the Lines                                                                                                                        	Finally, the last test is along the power and phone lines                      that connect your computer/modem.  Get up real close to the lines               and move the radio slowly and carefully from the place where the                lines come into the house to where they actually connect to the                 computer/modem.  By now you should have a good feel for how the                 EMI  signals sound so make an effort to tune them in - vary the                 tuning and volume.  Especially look at places where the                         cables/lines go close to offending devices or where they are                    coiled (coiled cables have a tendency to act as antennas).                                                                                                      	If you've taken good notes, by the time you've completed all                   the tests you should have an excellent understanding of the                     electromagnetic environment in and around your house... Now it's                time to do something!                                                                                                                                           MINIMIZING THE EMI:                                                                                                                                             	By now you may be thinking, "This is hopeless!  I've got EMI                   EVERYWHERE!"  Welll.... Yes, in this technological society that's               normal; but, it's not hopeless.  There are several different                    things you can do to reduce the harmful effects of EMI and a                    couple of them don't even cost a dime!                                                                                                                                                      Isolation                                                                                                                           	For example, if it's possible you should try to isolate your                   computer/modem from the rest of the house.  I'm fortunate enough                to have a special room in a corner of the house that is away from               the TV, the kitchen with all its appliances, the utility room                   with the washer and dryer, etc.  Also, I use some devices to                    filter the power and phone lines.  The act of isolating your                    computer/modem from sources of EMI is probably the most effective               way to abrogate the effects of EMI; however, there are other                    methods that also work AND are especially useful when combined                  with isolation.                                                                                                                                                                          Re-Orientation                                                                                                                         	Re-orientation of the emitting device is often very                            effective.  Remember when we checked the TV and found that the                  EMI signals were strongest from the front and back?  If your                    computer/modem is near the TV, try to rearrange things so that                  the TV radiates in a direction away from the computer/modem.  You               probably noticed, when you were checking the individual                         appliances, that nearly all of them radiated their EMI signals in               a directional pattern.  So, although it may be a little like                    musical chairs, re-orientation of the offending devices can                     significantly reduce the amount of noise being aimed at your                    computer/modem and their power and phone lines.                                                                                                                                             Shielding                                                                                                                           	Depending on the construction of your home, sometimes you                      can shield your computer/modem with as simple a chore as closing                the door.  However, most often, to be truly effective, shielding                requires an in depth knowledge of the EMI to be shut out; and, it               can get a little pricy.  Still, you can shield the lines without                too much expense - some old newspapers, tin foil, and duct tape                 can be used to shield the lines... or, you could buy shielded                   cables.  Warning! Any time you use a conductive material (tin                   foil) for shielding, after the job is done, you should run                      another test in that specific area because signals have the                     ability to "jump" from one source to another - your shielding                   could act as a reflective antenna and spread the EMI in a new                   direction.  None-the-Less, shielding of the lines IS a good idea.

Now a                days, most all electrical devices come with warnings about how                  much interference they cause - look for these warnings and read                 them carefully.

What makes Doom so special?  Simplicity, realism, and               profound carnage, says PC Magazine.  Entertainment Weekly has described         Doom as the multimedia equivalent of Natural Born Killers: "A relentless        rock and roll gorefest, a raw thrill-of-the-hunt experience that just           happens to have some of the coolest 3-D graphics ever designed."  The           game is so pervasive that office computer networks have been stalled            while employees stalk each other in real-time death matches.  There are         no draws--it's kill or be killed.                                                                                                                               But the real story behind this 3-D gaming masterpiece is that it can be         customized, and that's where Hank Leukart, author of THE DOOM HACKER'S          GUIDE (MIS:Press book/CD-ROM, March 1995, ISBN: 1-55828-428-1), comes           in.  This book/CD package is a boon to wannabe Doom masters by allowing         players to make their very own versions of Doom and Doom II. Leukart's          informative Doom FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) has been packaged with        Doom and Doom II, accessed online by tens of thousands, and cited by            publications from PC Magazine to The New York Times.                                                                                                            In the book, Leukart reveals how to project your own computer fantasies         onto the screen. "Picture replacing the demons in the game with your            friends, or turning a shotgun into a meat cleaver," Leukart tempts, with        a smile.  "Or you can construct Doom levels so that they have a                 strikingly similar layout to your school's campus or your place of work.        Or maybe you'd like to substitute the Baron of Hell's ominous scream            with your neighbors' sons' obnoxious shrieking.  You can even change the        soundtrack to play a little piece called 'Death in B Minor.'  The               possibilities are virtually limitless."                                                                                                                         In nine chapters, Leukart takes the reader through the intricacies and          possibilities of Doom.  First, he introduces the building blocks of Doom        and how to create the rooms, doors, steps, and other architectural              elements meant to heighten the thrill of the chase.  Then he fine-tunes         the basics by introducing DEU (Doom Editing Utilities by our own Raphael        Quinet!), a DOS-based map editor.  This is the utility that can turn            Doom into your home, office, or campus in a few hours.  Take a lesson           from his section on using a map editor and creating action-packed               levels, each designed to enhance the playing experience.  Graphics,             sound, and music are all under your control when you master the                 NewWADTool (NWT, authored by Dennis Moller), a slick piece of code that         turns your average Troopers into your co-worker, your boss, even New            Gingrich.  Change the way Doom is played, alter the speed of a gun,             modify the monsters' actions, or customize the text messages by using           the editing tool DeHackEd, by Greg Lewis.  Once these details are               mastered, one of the most-read sections will be the level design                section, which covers "Common Mistakes Made by Novices," "Making Good           One-Player Levels," "Make Good Cooperative Mode Levels," and "Making            Good DeathMatch Version 1.0 and 2.0 Levels."  The appendices are a vital        reference for Doom hackers, listing every resource name and filename as         well as the dozens of utilties and sample files on the CD-ROM.                                                                                                  Best of all, THE DOOM HACKER'S GUIDE comes packaged with The Doom               Hacker's CD, which contains all the tools you need to create new Doom           scenarios, as well as an abundance of add-on levels, graphics, and              sounds. The CD also includes DEU, DoomCAD, NWT, and DeHackEd.  Also             packaged are Edmap and WadEd, two other Doom map editors.  Two of the           most popular add-ons are Xmas/Doom (thanks to our friends on #doom on           IRC) and Clinton Doom (you'll have to see it for youself). And if you           run into roadblocks, The "Official" DOOM FAQ, compiled by Hank Leukart          (me again!), is also bundled with the CD, so your answers are just a few        keystrokes away.                                                                                                                                                With The DOOM HACKER'S GUIDE in hand you're more than ready for the next        DeathMatch--but this time you'll be playing on your own turf, by your           own rules.  Let the games begin!

Then I started voting for my favorite games. I started a BBS,     "Sahara BBS" on mid 1989 and I am still running it. At some point in time       when the Top 100 was just in its first issues, I started copying these          issues and posting them in my BBS for public as text files. We even had a       dedicated files directory for this list as well as a couple of others. Our      users enjoyed it so much, that if I delayed the posting even one day, I'd       get howls and screams from everyone!! Now, we started an Internet access for    the BBS users. This is the first of its kind in the whole of Saudi Arabia.      So, we are getting some good attention and the number of interested users       is certainly increasing. We now have a seperate Conference for the Top 100      list and lots of users are following the tracks of the Top 100 for buying       their games. We here, at Sahara BBS, both users and operators, think that       the Top 100 Games List is one of the best publications on the Internet. We      think this is what the Internet is all about. Sharing information and           having fun at the same time! Continue the good work .."  Thank you, I will!    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Do you have an interesting story to tell about the Top 100? Do you have a       World Wide Web page pointing to this list? Do you publish the list on a BBS     or in a magazine? Do you distribute it via leaflets, radio or tv, satellite     or telephone? Did the Top 100 change your way life? Or are you just glad it     exists? Tell me about it! And maybe you will be in next weeks' Spotlight!      ==============================================================================                                                                                   The following games have not yet received enough points to enter the Top 100:  ==============================================================================   New Contestants (Runners Up)          Edition 120 -

ScaryFish 2.2 is the latest version of a unique multi-species fishing           simulation game for IBM-compatible computers.  The shareware version            gives you fully-functional access to almost 50 "holes" at 3 "worlds",           over 25 of the game's 40+ species, and access to most of the game's             diverse tackle/equipment selection.                                                                                                                             Anglers (fishermen) appreciate the realism, but you don't have to know          anything about fishing to enjoy the game.  The diversity of the situations      and always-different results let you run the program again and again.  As       you run the game a number of hilarious mishaps might occur.  ScaryFish          appeals to all ages and is popular with many who don't normally play            computer games as well as regular gamers.                                                                                                                       System requirements are still extremely low: an IBM-compatible computer         with at least 470K RAM.  Graphics are not required (!), but the game            supports up to 640x480 VGA.  The zipfile is under 200K; obviously the           game won't clog up your disk space.                                                                                                                             The new version includes the spectacular results of the 1994 records            competition (result94.txt).  ScaryFish has one of the most extensive            "highscore" lists of any game, mostly for big fish.  Now records are            saved for all species as opposed to just the original 32, so species            such as Shark and Tarpon are now eligible.                                                                                                                      SCHTKR is the "lite" version of the game's Make Your Own Worlds Utility         (MOWU) that lets you create your own "worlds" for use with the game.  It        also has a custom screensaver of fish species anglers care about as well        as a challenging set of rapids at one of the program's example worlds.                                                                                          SCHTKR and the MOWU have a design competition where you could win $200          or more!  The deadline for the first Best Worlds Contest has passed, with       entries from 4 countries.  Beginning May 1 1995 registered users can order      a User Worlds disk with hundreds of new fishing holes and the opportunity       to vote for their favorite "world", for a low $9 to cover costs.  The           deadline for the second Best Worlds Contest is December 31, 1995.

STAND BY ME, MISERY, THE SHAWSHANK          REDEMPTION, and now DOLORES CLAIBORNE are all intelligent, well-fashioned       films that bear little resemblance to the gory schlock of SLEEPWALKERS          and PET SEMATARY.                                                                                                                                                    DOLORES CLAIBORNE begins as a dark and dreary murder mystery set in        the small town of Little Tall, Maine.  The skies above this village are         continually congested with clouds, the streets are slick with rain, and         the sea is gray and angry.  Yet this story, which starts out as an              investigation of a suspicious death, soon takes a grim, disturbing turn.        Memories crowd out the present as the narrative takes us back eighteen          years to expose the ugly roots of one family's dysfunction.                                                                                                          Two deaths lie at the center of DOLORES CLAIBORNE--Vera Donovan's          (Judy Parfitt) in the present and Joe St. George's (David Strathairn) in        the past.  After Joe fell into a partially-concealed well during the            total solar eclipse of 1975, his wife Dolores (Kathy Bates) was                 suspected, but never convicted, of murder.  The death was eventually            ruled as accidental, splotching the previously-perfect record of                Detective John Mackey (Christopher Plummer).  Now, nearly two decades           later, Dolores stands accused of killing her invalid employer and,              although the evidence is entirely circumstantial, Mackey is determined to       get a conviction.                                                                                                                                                    Dolores' daughter Selena (Ellen Muth at age 13; Jennifer Jason Leigh       at age 31), a reporter living in New York city, receives a fax of an            article in a Bangor newspaper detailing her mother's suspected                  involvement in Vera's death.  Haunted by her muddled recollections of her       father's end and driven by an unshakable conviction that her mother is          guilty, she takes a brief leave-of-absence to go home.  Once there, she         is confronted not only by the unpleasantness of the present, but by the         ghosts of the past.                                                                                                                                                  Parts of DOLORES CLAIBORNE are delivered with an unshielded                emotional and psychological impact.  The script is not consistently at          this high level--there are times, most notably during the climactic             sequence--when unfortunate choices are made, but the overall result is          a film that illuminates certain "forbidden" shadows.  Generally,                mainstream movies avoid risky material like this honest exposition of the       issues underlying the fissure between Dolores and Selena.                                                                                                            The main characters, mother and daughter, are well-written and             effectively portrayed.  Dolores is a sad, lonely survivor who has,              perhaps unjustly, endured a lifetime of misery.  Secrets can be an              oppressive burden, and Dolores has been worn down by them.  Selena, on          the other hand, has become an alcoholic and drug-abuser as the result of        what she has repressed.  Bates and Leigh, two accomplished and versatile        actors, are in peak form as they settle into the isolation of their             characters--two very different people whose individual pain is                  intertwined.                                                                                                                                                         Less effort is vested in DOLORES CLAIBORNE's male principals.  In          the case of Joe, this is understandable.  He exists only in flashbacks          with our impressions filtered through Dolores' perspective.  She has no         reason to recall him kindly, and Strathairn's portrayal echoes this.            Plummer's John Mackey, on the other hand, is basically an unpleasant            person.  Supposedly, he's a very good detective, but we're never shown          anything other than obsession and bitterness.                                                                                                                        There's a lot to digest in DOLORES CLAIBORNE.  The subtle visual           effects, which mix digital animation and live-action, form an effective         framework for a story teeming with emotional turmoil.  With their unique        method of delineating shifts in time (a person in the present actually          walking into the past), the flashbacks are invested with a degree of            eerie immediacy.  Although the forced ending, which seems deigned to            create an unnatural moment of triumph, weakens the climactic catharsis,         it doesn't diminish the human tragedy which is central to DOLORES               CLAIBORNE.                                                                                                                                                      - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                                                                                                  @START@Review: Camilla                                                                                              CAMILLA                                                            A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  5.4                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: varies (early 1995)                                          Running Length: 1:29                                                            MPAA Classification: PG-13 (Nudity, language, mature themes)                                                                                                    Starring: Jessica Tandy, Bridget Fonda, Elias Koteas, Maury Chaykin,                      Graham Greene, Hume Cronyn                                            Director: Deepa Mehta                                                           Producer: Simon Relph                                                           Screenplay: Paul Quarrington based on a short story by Ali Jennings             Cinematography: Guy Dufaux                                                      Music: Daniel Lanois                                                            Released by Miramax Films                                                                                                                                            The first word that comes to mind when attempting to describe              CAMILLA is "ordinary."  Nothing in this film, except perhaps a few              appealing performances, is worth a backward glance.  CAMILLA is the kind        of dull, vapid road picture that makes melodramatic twaddle like Edward         Zwick's 1992 LEAVING NORMAL look invigorating.                                                                                                                       The problems start with the story--a sad combination of                    predictable circumstances, recycled characters, and requisite cliches.          Admittedly, these are strung together with skill, but the lack of special       moments makes CAMILLA a largely-unimpressive experience.  This is all-          too-familiar territory, with a worthy cast doing their best to salvage          something.                                                                                                                                                           Freda and Vincent Lopez (Bridget Fonda and Elias Koteas) are               vacationing in Georgia.  He's a graphic designer and she's a composer.          One day, while taking a stroll, Freda hears violin music.  Intrigued, she       investigates and meets Camilla Cara (Jessica Tandy), an aging-but-              energetic former concert performer living in a neighboring mansion owned        by her movie producer son Harold (Maury Chaykin), whom she refers to as         "a thief and a buffoon."                                                                                                                                             Vincent and Harold hit it off immediately, leading to a job offer          for Vincent to design Harold's movie posters.  Eager to get started,            Vincent agrees to fly back to Toronto while Harold goes to Atlanta to           check on the progress of his latest flick.  Freda elects to remain in           Georgia with Camilla.  After the departure of the men, the two women            quickly form a friendship that transcends the generation barrier.  On a         spur-of-the-moment impulse, they pack a few things and get in Freda's car       to head north for the Winter Gardens in Toronto where Brahms' Violin            Concerto--the most difficult piece ever attempted by Camilla--is                scheduled to be performed.  The trip doesn't go smoothly, however, and          along the way there are a number of detours, including a disastrous ferry       boat excursion and a stopover at Niagara Falls.                                                                                                                      CAMILLA is an undemanding motion picture--too undemanding, in              fact.  Despite winning performances by the leads, there's little here for       an audience to chew on.  The film rambles along lazily, requiring little        more from viewers than that they avoid going into a coma.  Cursory              attention is fine--go to the bathroom and you won't miss anything.                                                                                                   CAMILLA isn't a "bad" movie per se.  It's just a rather flat and           uninspired one--the kind of thing that started with high hopes and good         intentions, but never developed further.  It has a made-for-TV feel             irrespective of the big-name cast, something like a DRIVING MISS DAISY          lite.  Nevertheless, Jessica Tandy, in the penultimate role of a                distinguished career, shines through the subpar material, occasionally          making this film not only bearable, but somewhat engaging.                                                                                                      - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                  @START@Review: Bad Boys                                                                                              BAD BOYS                                                          A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  4.0                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: wide release 4/7/95                                          Running Length: 1:59                                                            MPAA Classification: R (Violence, language, mature themes)                                                                                                      Starring: Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Tea Leoni, Tcheky Karyo,                           Theresa Randle, Joe Pantoliano                                        Director: Michael Bay                                                           Producers: Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer                                    Screenplay: Michael Barrie, Jim Mulholland, and Doug Richardson                 Cinematography: Howard Atherton                                                 Music: Mark Mancina                                                             Released by Columbia Pictures                                                                                                                                        48 HOURS, BEVERLY HILLS COP, and LETHAL WEAPON were all, to some           extent, reasonably entertaining action films.  The unavoidable result of        their success has been a long string of sequels and rip-offs.  The latest       is BAD BOYS, an overlong sample of MTV-style direction that "borrows"           heavily from these (and numerous other) flicks, and, in the process,            elevates them to the comparable level of CITIZEN KANE.                                                                                                               The action sequences--and there are a lot of them--are apparently          designed to camouflage the lack of a credible story.  I suppose someone         guessed that if the audience was too busy following bullets, bodies,            and explosions, they wouldn't have time to wonder about things like             logic and coherence.  Unfortunately, the movie contains occasional              moments of inactivity and, during those, the first thing that comes to          mind is:  What's the point?  After asking the question a few times, it          becomes clear that not only are things moving fast, but they're                 completely out of control.  Consider what happens to a downhill skier           or race car in this situation, and you get an idea of what BAD BOYS has         to offer.                                                                                                                                                            When it came to putting ideas on paper, the writers had a beginning        (a drug heist from the Miami P.D.'s evidence safe) and an ending (guess         what happens to the bad guys).  They also had a premise:  take a couple         of mismatched cops who hide their respect for each other, and team them         with a female civilian/witness who is destined to prove her worth, but          only after botching things a few times.  No, it's not original, but it's        the only glue that holds this production together, even if it is spread         far too thin.  Because outside of these few basics from script writing          101, no thought was put into the screenplay for BAD BOYS.                                                                                                            The cops, Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey, are played by TV sitcom          stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith.  For reasons too silly to explain,        they're forced to swap identities whenever they're with a murder witness        (Tea Leoni).  If there ever was comic potential in this unnecessarily           contrived situation, it's not realized.  I think THREE'S COMPANY may have       done the same thing, only better.  Much better.                                                                                                                      Smith and Lawrence are likable, and they have a certain modest             chemistry that surfaces during the so-called "humorous" banter, but             everything about their characters is a regurgitation of previously              recycled material.  (Does that make it re-recycled?)  The other                 characters are equally familiar:  the tough female sidekick, the loyal          wife (Theresa Randle), the evil drug lord (Tcheky Karyo), and the loud-         mouthed police captain (Joe Pantoliano).                                                                                                                             The most complimentary thing I can say about BAD BOYS is that it has       style and energy.  The cinematography is frequently inventive, and Mark         Mancini's SPEED-like score is the perfect accompaniment for chases and          fights.  Unfortunately, there's only so far a movie can go on loud music,       nicely-framed shots, testosterone, and adrenaline.  BAD BOYS takes the          often-traveled road, and leads the audience to a dead end.                                                                                                      - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                  @START@Review: Funny Bones                                                                                         FUNNY BONES                                                         A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  4.6                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: limited release 3/24/95                                      Running Length: 2:07                                                            MPAA Classification: R (Mature themes, language, violence, body parts)                                                                                          Starring: Oliver Platt, Lee Evans, Leslie Caron, Freddie Davies,                          George Carl, Jerry Lewis, Ruta Lee                                    Director: Peter Chelsom                                                         Producers:  Simon Fields and Peter Chelsom                                      Screenplay: Peter Chelsom and Peter Flannery                                    Cinematography: Eduardo Serra                                                   Music: John Altman                                                              Released by Hollywood Pictures                                                                                                                                       FUNNY BONES is anything but what the title suggests.  As a comedy,         this movie is a complete flop, with fewer laughs than the average               mindless sitcom.  As a drama, it isn't much more successful.                    Writer/director Peter Chelsom, who brought us 1992's magical HEAR MY            SONG, here gives us an array of offbeat characters who lack any semblance       of three-dimensionality.  They all have their little quirks, but none is        able to engage our attention or sympathy.                                                                                                                            For the most part, FUNNY BONES is flat.  Even the presence of funny        man Jerry Lewis, still as energetic and zany as ever, can't liven up            these proceedings.  The story doesn't allow for much light humor,               preferring instead to dwell on long-buried family secrets, and the tone         has only two modes: dismal and grim.  While this might be the proper mood       for a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions, the actual story turns out to       be rather unspectacular--not to mention muddled.                                                                                                                     Tommy Fawkes (Oliver Platt) is an up-and-coming comedian about to go       on stage for his big Las Vegas debut.  On hand are his mother, Laura            (Ruta Lee), and father, George (Jerry Lewis), a world-famous comic.  From       the beginning, Tommy's evening is a disaster.  No one's laughing at his         jokes and he's becoming progressively more desperate.  Finally, after the       spectacular failure of one gag, Tommy walks off the stage after informing       his audience that he has only two weeks to live (this is a metaphorical,        not factual, statement).                                                                                                                                             Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, a transaction is taking place              between two ships.  A group of Englishmen, led by an unscrupulous               policeman named Stanley Sharkey (Ian McNeice), is buying six mysterious         "eggs" from four Frenchman.  Sharkey's party has no intention of playing        fair, however, and things get ugly.  One of the French crew is killed;          one of the English, Jack Parker (Lee Evans), is hung out to dry by his          companions; and an egg is lost.  Jack, a strong swimmer, manages to make        his way to shore.  Once on solid land, his emotional instability gets the       better of him and he climbs the Blackpool tower, threatening to kill            himself.  He is talked down through the efforts of his father (Freddie          Davis), uncle (George Carl), mother (Leslie Caron), and a dog called            Toast.                                                                                                                                                               Fresh from his Las Vegas failure, Tommy arrives in Blackpool,              intending to find and buy funny acts to convert for his own use.  After         witnessing dozens of embarrassing performances, Tommy is introduced to          the Parker Brothers--two aging gentlemen with a "unique" slapstick act.         Things are not as straightforward as they first seem, however, and in           getting to know the Parkers, Tommy is forced to confront unpleasant             truths about himself and his famous father.                                                                                                                          Anyone who has seen a Vaudeville act knows that, like the routines         of standup comics, they're a lot more funny in person than on camera.  In       fact, it takes an extremely talented performer to effectively translate a       portion of the spontaneous humor to the screen.  In FUNNY BONES, while          the cast is comprised of accomplished actors, no one exhibits this              ability.  Unfortunately, more than one quarter of the film is devoted to        Vaudeville performances, and these sequences are more often tedious than        diverting.                                                                                                                                                           As lifeless as the slapstick routines are, a solidly-dramatic script       could have salvaged FUNNY BONES.  Alas, there isn't one.  Oh, there are a       few clever lines here and there, and one or two thought provoking ideas,        but little is done with any of the better elements.  Character                  development is routine and the narrative often strays onto odd tangents.        By the time the overlong story sputters to a close, only a few loose ends       have been tied off, and you're unlikely to care about the ones left             unresolved.  This motion picture is a disjointed, messy affair, and a           disappointment to those who had been looking forward to this director's         sophomore effort.                                                                                                                                               - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                  @START@Review: Priest                                                                                                PRIEST                                                            A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  8.5                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: limited release beginning 3/24/95                            Running Length: 1:40                                                            MPAA Classification: R (Mature themes, sex)                                                                                                                     Starring: Linus Roache, Tom Wilkinson, Cathy Tyson, Robert Carlyle,                       Christine Tremarco, Robert Pugh, Lesley Sharp, James Ellis            Director: Antonia Bird                                                          Producers: George Faber and Josephine Ward                                      Screenplay: Jimmy McGovern                                                      Cinematography: Fred Tammes                                                     Music: Andy Roberts                                                             Released by Miramax Films                                                                                                                                            The Catholic community's outcry against PRIEST has already begun,          and it will doubtlessly become more intense before it abates.  One of the       most disturbing elements of any organized protest of this sort is that          most of those involved will not have seen the picture in question.              Another equally unfortunate byproduct is that, as was the case with THE         LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, the movie itself may get lost somewhere in the       resulting polarization.  If that happens, it will be a shame, because           PRIEST has a lot to say, and doesn't deserve to be hamstrung by those who       miss the point or have no idea what they're talking about.                                                                                                           The main character is Father Greg Pilkington (Linus Roache), a             by-the-book, straightlaced Roman Catholic priest who is new to a rural          parish in Great Britain.  Father Greg is the sort who believes his job is       to give moral advice, not act as a social activist--a charge he levels          against fellow priest Father Matthew Thomas (Tom Wilkinson).                                                                                                         While trying to serve his flock, however, Father Greg has his own          personal demons to wrestle.  Not only is he unable to keep his vow of           celibacy, he breaks it with another man--something many of his less             tolerant parishioners would surely view as an "abomination" if they             learned of it.  Even as he struggles with his sexual identity and its           implications, Father Greg is forced to endure an additional crisis of           faith when a fourteen year old girl (Christine Tremarco) comes to him           under the seal of confession and admits to being sexually molested by her       father.                                                                                                                                                              There is nothing in PRIEST that hasn't appeared in recent newspaper        accounts, which makes the Catholic League's opposition to the film              somewhat ludicrous, not to mention hypocritical.  Perhaps they feel             threatened by PRIEST's depiction of men of the cloth as flawed human            beings rather than as icons.  Certainly, the men who don the collar here        are not perfect, but neither are they lunatics, Epicureans, or devils.                                                                                               Jimmy McGovern's script does an excellent job of dovetailing the two       main elements of the film--Greg's homosexuality and Lisa's sexual               abuse--into a compelling whole, often using unexpected bursts of humor to       keep the level of tension from becoming too intense.  Arguably, the more        stirring story centers on the priest's battles with his conscience over         how to help Lisa, but this film wouldn't have the same emotional                resonance without the other pieces.  In fact, the final scene                   incorporates several threads into a moment that, while perhaps a little         overdone, is nonetheless powerful.                                                                                                                                   PRIEST addresses both social and religious themes.  At its core,           however, is the question of absolute certainty versus faith.  There is,         of course, no answer to most of the questions that Greg agonizes over,          but these--such as how Christ could expect him to keep silent when that         silence condemns a girl to continued suffering--are presented for the           audience's consideration.  It is by his reaction to the issues that             Greg's true character is slowly revealed.  It doesn't take long for us to       realize that our first impression of the man is as false as his facade.                                                                                              Linus Roache gives a multi-layered portrayal of Father Greg,               presenting a character we can accept equally as a spiritual advisor and         as the tortured man beneath the collar.  Tom Wilkinson is more                  understated, but no less real, at Father Matthew, the older priest who          accepts Greg's confidences without judging him.  Christine Tremarco is          chillingly believable as Lisa, and Robert Pugh radiates menace as her           father--a man who gives a horrifyingly logical explanation for his              activities.                                                                                                                                                          Provocative films like PRIEST rarely arrive without creating some          sort of controversy.  By not compromising her vision (which is similar to       that of fellow British film maker Ken Loach), director Antonia Bird has         fashioned a picture that not only stirs up a hornet's nest of timely and        volatile spiritual issues, but faces up to homosexuality and incest with        a frankness which few films dare.  PRIEST is effective not only because         of all the ground it traverses, but because the final turn brings closure       without excess.                                                                                                                                                 - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                  @START@Review: Stuart Saves His Family                                                                       STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY                                                   A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  4.2                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: general release 4/12/95                                      Running Length: 1:37                                                            MPAA Classification: PG-13 (Language, mature themes)                                                                                                            Starring: Al Franken, Laura San Giacomo, Vincent D'Onofrio,                               Shirley Knight, Harris Yulin, Lesley Boone                            Director: Harold Ramis                                                          Producers: Lorne Michaels and Trevor Albert                                     Screenplay: Al Franken based on his book                                        Cinematography: Lauro Escorel                                                   Music: Marc Shaiman                                                             Released by Paramount Pictures                                                                                                                                       STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY is yet another feature spinoff of a SATURDAY       NIGHT LIVE skit.  Unfortunately, like the notable flops that preceded it        (THE CONEHEADS, IT'S PAT), this one should have remained confined to            television.  Stretched out to an agonizing ninety-seven minutes, STUART         goes from being passably amusing to tedious to virtually unwatchable.  Of       course, part of the problem is the script, which suffers from a bizarre         case of split personality--this has to be the first SNL movie that              attempts to deliver a drama-based denouement.                                                                                                                        Since FORREST GUMP debuted to universal popular acclaim, the movie-        going community has been awaiting the inevitable copycats.  Odd that the        first should come from the same production company that distributed GUMP        (Paramount), and that it should emerge from under the SNL umbrella.             While it wouldn't be unexpected for writer/star Al Franken to parody            Robert Zemeckis' megahit, that's not the approach he chose.  Instead,           with only the barest hint of mockery, he has tapped into the mawkishness        that made GUMP so well-loved.  Stuart isn't necessarily a Forrest clone,        but he's a socially-challenged individual who overcomes great adversity         to attain fame and prosperity.                                                                                                                                       The film starts out with a light, satirical touch, showing us part         of an episode of a cable access show called DAILY AFFIRMATION, which is         hosted by Stuart Smalley (Al Franken).  Stuart, a member of about half-a-       dozen support groups, including Al-anon, Overeaters' Anonymous, and             Debtors' Anonymous, lisps his way through the short program, dispensing         pop psychological advice.  His "fifteen minutes of fame" are in jeopardy,       however, since the director of programming has moved DAILY AFFIRMATION          from its customary 12:00 noon slot to 2:45 am, right after a hair               replacement infomercial.                                                                                                                                             Stuart's family is as dysfunctional as they come.  His father              (Harris Yulin) and brother (Vincent D'Onofrio) are alcoholics, his sister       (Leslie Boone) is angst-riddled and overweight, and his mother (Shirley         Knight) is indecisive and insensitive.  As Stuart puts it (in one of the        film's wittiest lines), "Seeing my mother is like a trip to the dentist's       before the advent of modern pain killer."  Fortunately, Stuart lives in         Chicago, where he has friends like the equally screwed up Julia (Laura          San Giacomo), while his family is a long bus trip away in Minnesota.            Nevertheless, a series of events, beginning with the death of an aunt,          keeps Stuart shuttling back and forth between states.                                                                                                                It's difficult to say whether, given a chance, the movie could have        succeeded as a uncompromising lampoon.  The opening half-hour, which is         played almost exclusively for laughs, has its moments (several of which         are highlighted by Marc Shaiman's perfectly-toned score), but there's a         feeling that the material is already being stretched beyond its natural         limits.  The film, however, decides to get serious.  Instead of                 continuing its jokey, farcical tone, it turns almost grim as the                storyline centers on the cancerous effects of alcoholism in Stuart's            family.  There's nothing humorous in the scenes where Stuart and his            siblings confront their father about how his drinking has scarred their         lives.                                                                                                                                                               While on the surface it might seem laudable that Franken has decided       to guide his film in this unexpected direction, the problem is that the         drama doesn't work.  It comes across as flat and heavy-handed.  Since           each member of Stuart's family is initially introduced as a stereotypical       caricature, it's difficult to accept any of them in a situation where           they're intended to be taken seriously.  Franken doesn't seem to realize        that his one-dimensional characters lack the depth necessary for                believable drama.  The result is a failed attempt to turn a SATURDAY            NIGHT LIVE spinoff into a social commentary.                                                                                                                         Like Forrest Gump, Stuart Smalley has his arsenal of pithy sayings,        including "It's easier to put on slippers than to carpet the entire             world."  Such comments seek to put a lighter spin on a bleak topic, but         they're offered up too late.  By then, a heavy dose of gravity has              already capsized the floundering ship.  In the end, it's this movie that        needs saving--but there's no life preserver.                                                                                                                    - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                  @START@Review: Tank Girl                                                                                             TANK GIRL                                                         A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  6.8                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: general release 3/31/95                                      Running Length: 1:44                                                            MPAA Classification: R (Violence, language, sexual situations)                                                                                                  Starring: Lori Petty, Malcolm McDowell, Naomi Watts, Ice T, Jeff Kober,                   Don Harvey, Stacy Linn Rawsower                                       Director: Rachel Talalay                                                        Producers: Richard B.

To be          successful in this arena, a movie must turn its back on even the                semblance of conventionality, expressing everything from the most               insignificant line of dialogue to a climactic event with an irreverence         that would make the Monty Python troupe members offer winks and nudges of       appreciation.  It is because TANK GIRL takes this approach that it              germinates into a high-spirited, madcap example of film making run amok.        Certainly, this movie isn't art, but it sure is fun.                                                                                                                 Film adaptations of comic books have become nearly as prevalent as         those based on Stephen King stories.  In some cases (THE CROW, THE MASK),       they work reasonably well.  In others (TALES FROM THE CRYPT), the results       are disastrous.  None, however, not even Jim Carrey's special effects           tour de force, have gone to the extremes visited by TANK GIRL.  Nothing         is sacred--this movie pushes the envelope as far as it will go, and the         result is an offbeat and energized juxtaposition of action and comedy.          This is the kind of tone that films like HUDSON HAWK, THE LAST ACTION           HERO, and DEMOLITION MAN tried in vain to capture.                                                                                                                   It's the mixture of seeming spontaneity and a total lack of                seriousness that fuels whatever success TANK GIRL has.  The name of the         game is outrageousness, and the script never attempts anything that might       damage it.  There is no characterization to speak of, and the plot is           simply a nonsensical piece of fluff upon which to drape so much excess.         And just when you think things can't get sillier, something happens to          change your mind, whether it's the insertion of oddly-rendered animated         sequences, a bizarre rendition of Cole Porter's "Let's Do It", or Lori          Petty's title character sporting a brassiere that would make Madonna gasp       with envy.                                                                                                                                                           TANK GIRL takes place in a post-apocalyptic future.  In this               scenario, the Earth-devastating disaster was a comet strike, and it has         left most of the globe in ruins and water in short supply.  There are           three types of survivors:  members of an organization called Water and          Power, small bands of nomads who won't submit to authority, and the             mysterious and deadly Rippers.  Rebecca (Lori Petty), aka "Tank Girl", is       a member of a renegade faction in the Blue Dunes.  When Water and Power         troops arrive, they kill everybody except Rebecca and a little girl             called Sam (Stacy Linn Rawsower).  While the girl is sent to work in a          strip joint, Rebecca is granted a personal audience with Kesslee (Malcolm       McDowell), the leader of Water and Power.                                                                                                                            Kesslee wants Rebecca to join his forces.  When she refuses, she's         put to work in a labor comp.  While looking for a way to escape, Rebecca        meets another ill-treated woman (Naomi Watts).  Together, the pair search       for a way out of Water and Power's fortress while Kesslee plots how to          use Rebecca to uncover the secret entrance to the lair of the Rippers--the      vicious and hitherto untouchable group of "demons" that routinely               slaughter Water and Power troops.                                                                                                                                    Given her bleached blond punk hairdo and ever-perky expression, Lori       Petty is an inspired choice for Tank Girl.  She gets all the right              inflections on the one-liners and doesn't know the meaning of the term          "reserve".  Malcolm McDowell, the consummate over-the-top villain,              displays a far more delectable nastiness here than in STAR TREK                 GENERATIONS.  This bad guy is someone to root against.  Naomi Watts is          appealing as Tank Girl's sidekick and Ice T is virtually unrecognizable         as the Ripper T-Saint.                                                                                                                                               With a breakneck, don't-bother-to-stop-and-think-about-it pace, TANK       GIRL zips along for over one-hundred moments, only occasionally lapsing         from its zaniness.  The rock-and-rap soundtrack, supervised by Courtney         Love-Cobain, invigorates certain scenes, and blends nicely with the             visuals.  Judging by the finished product, it's pretty clear that               director Rachel Talalay achieved her vision.  TANK GIRL is one of those         chew-the-popcorn, munch-the-candy flicks--the kind you go into                  expecting to have a good time, but nothing more.  Given those                   expectations, disappointment is as unlikely as boredom.                                                                                                         - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                  @START@Review: Jefferson in Paris                                                                              JEFFERSON IN PARIS                                                      A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  7.2                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: limited release 4/7/95                                       Running Length: 2:22                                                            MPAA Classification: PG-13 (Mature themes)                                                                                                                      Starring: Nick Nolte, Greta Scacchi, Thandie Newton, Gwyneth Paltrow,                     Lambert Wilson, Simon Callow                                          Director: James Ivory                                                           Producer: Ismail Merchant                                                       Screenplay: Ruth Prawer Jhabvala                                                Cinematography: Pierre L'Homme                                                  Music: Richard Robbins                                                          Released by Touchstone Pictures                                                                                                                                      THE BOSTONIANS.  A ROOM WITH A VIEW.  MR. AND MRS. BRIDGE.  HOWARDS        END.  THE REMAINS OF THE DAY.  These represent the best of Merchant-            Ivory--a category in which their latest, JEFFERSON IN PARIS, does not           belong.  Nevertheless, although this examination of several years in the        life of Thomas Jefferson (the U.S. minister to France between 1784 and          1789) is flawed, it nevertheless represents two-plus hours of diverting         melodrama.  The historical accuracy of certain plot points may be in            doubt, but this certainly isn't the first motion picture "based on a true       story" to play loose with the facts.                                                                                                                                 Nick Nolte looks like Thomas Jefferson, and his deserved reputation        as a fine actor further argues in his favor as the perfect choice for the       title role.  Inexplicably, however, Nolte is actually rather flat.  As          was the case with Robert Duvall in HBO's STALIN, the part seems to              smother him.  He's adequate, but no emoting is involved, and there are          many sequences where Jefferson comes across as stiff and lifeless.  Nolte       never successfully forges a bond between his character and the audience.                                                                                             The whole film is rather superficial.  It tells its story reasonably       well, but doesn't do much more.  Considering that this picture comes from       Merchant-Ivory, the producer-director team that has given us a number of        multi-layered films, the lack of depth is disappointing.  JEFFERSON IN          PARIS is just another MASTERPIECE THEATER-style costume drama.                                                                                                       There are four principle storylines developing in parallel                 throughout the movie.  The first relates to Jefferson's burgeoning              friendship/romance with painter Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi).  The second       follows the changes in his relationship with one of his slaves, fifteen-        year old Sally Hemings (Thandie Newton).  Another examines the jealous          reactions of his daughter Patsy (Gwyneth Paltrow) to his mistresses.  The       final, and potentially most interesting, is an observation of the               political events leading up to the French Revolution, and how Jefferson         reacts to these.                                                                                                                                                     In JEFFERSON IN PARIS, it's the secondary performers who impress.          Thandie Newton (FLIRTING) brings life and vibrancy to Sally (although           there is one horribly over-the-top scene where she dances for Jefferson         in the privacy of his bed chamber).  Gwyneth Paltrow, who was excellent         in her FLESH AND BONE debut, gives a multi-dimensionality to a character        conflicted by love, commitment, and jealousy.  Simon Callow (FOUR               WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL) has a delightful turn as the gay husband of             Scacchi's Maria.                                                                                                                                                     When it comes to issues, JEFFERSON IN PARIS is feeble and fumbling.        After introducing the ironic hypocrisy of Jefferson's having written a          document claiming that "all men are created equal" while nevertheless           maintaining a significant contingent of slaves, little more of substance        is presented on the subject.  Equally given short shrift is the ideology        underlying the French Revolution.  Aside from a few brief discussions           filled with facile arguments, this particular element of the plot seems         designed more as an historical backdrop than anything else.                                                                                                          Impressions of JEFFERSON IN PARIS are likely to be based largely           upon expectations.  Those anticipating something with the depth and             breadth of a HOWARDS END will be disappointed.  Regardless, though it may       be occasionally slow-moving and perhaps a half-hour too long, this film         is put together with care and a mindfulness of quality.  Little here is         exceptional, but, fortunately, less is below par.  In the end, like QUEEN       MARGOT or 1776, JEFFERSON IN PARIS serves as a snapshot of history and          the characters that made their mark upon it.                                                                                                                    -James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                   @START@Review: Clean, Shaven                                                                                      CLEAN, SHAVEN                                                        A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  7.7                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: limited release 4/95                                         Running Length: 1:20                                                            MPAA Classification: Not Rated (Violence, gore, language)                                                                                                       Starring: Peter Greene, Robert Albert, Megan Owen, Jennifer MacDonald,                    Molly Castelloe                                                       Director: Lodge Kerrigan                                                        Producer: Lodge Kerrigan                                                        Screenplay: Lodge Kerrigan                                                      Cinematography: Teodoro Maniaci                                                 Music: Hahn Rowe                                                                Released by Strand Releasing                                                                                                                                         Consider how mainstream movies depict violence.  Bodies are chopped        up, blown apart, and torn to pieces.  Blood and gore flow as freely as          water.  Films like INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE are awash in a crimson            tide, and no one thinks twice about it.  Then along comes a film like           CLEAN, SHAVEN, where nothing is gratuitous, and suddenly viewers are            shocked.  HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER provoked a similar response,       for the same reasons.                                                                                                                                                There's no denying that the film is disturbing, at times profoundly        so.  One scene in particular resulted in more than half the audience            wincing, turning away, or leaving.  Often, it's the simplest, most              realistic forms of violence, when portrayed in such a vivid manner, that        cause the stomach to churn.  During CLEAN, SHAVEN's screening at the 1994       Sundance Film Festival, a member of the audience fainted.  As a result of       this single, thirty second sequence, which film maker Lodge Kerrigan            refused to edit out, this movie took nearly eighteen months to acquire a        distributor.                                                                                                                                                         Peter Winter (Peter Greene) is a schizophrenic, and CLEAN, SHAVEN          introduces us to his world, where paranoid delusions intermingle with           reality.  Through the use of viewpoint photography and stark, unusual           images, we are brought into Peter's mind.  It's not a pleasant place to         be.  Upon occasion, movies like to present a protagonist who straddles          the line of sanity, but CLEAN, SHAVEN shows no such ambiguity.  Peter is        clinically insane.  (One psychiatrist at the screening I attended               described this as "the best portrayal of untreated schizophrenia ever           [presented] on film.")                                                                                                                                               The story, which develops largely without dialogue, follows Peter's        quest to locate his young daughter Nicole (Jennifer MacDonald).  Having         been institutionalized for the last several years, Peter has had no             contact with Nicole, who had been living with her grandmother.  Now, she        has been adopted, and he is determined to find her.  His intentions are         profoundly unclear, and he is already under suspicion of having brutally        murdered another young girl.  A detective (Robert Albert) is on his             trail, closing in while gathering evidence.                                                                                                                          In many ways, CLEAN, SHAVEN is an incredible cinematic experience,         but it will neither entertain nor appeal to a "typical" movie-goer.             Writer/director Kerrigan is aware of this, but was unwilling to change a        frame of the final cut.  His vision, which took more than two years to          commit to film, remains intact.  And, frankly, without the controversial        scene, the character study would be incomplete.                                                                                                                      As was true of Michael Rooker in the title role of HENRY, so Peter         Greene is hauntingly convincing as CLEAN, SHAVEN's off-balance lead.            Whether scrubbing his skin with steel wool, cutting into his scalp with a       scissor, curled into a ball fighting against a flashback, or hiding from        his own reflection, Greene has a perfect sense of Peter.  The other             actors are all competent, but their work pales in comparison to this            singular performance.                                                                                                                                                It's always difficult to rate a film that, while powerful and well         made, is an exercise in endurance.  There are those--even among the             art-film crowd--who will find this picture unbearable.  Theaters will           warn of its graphic content.  Viewers will endlessly debate all the             unanswered questions posed within.  But no one who sits through this film       is likely to forget it.  CLEAN, SHAVEN is one of those rare movies that         leaves an indelible imprint on anyone still watching as the closing             credits roll.                                                                                                                                                   -James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                   @START@Review: The Sum of Us                                                                                      THE SUM OF US                                                        A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  8.0                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: limited release Spring 1995                                  Running Length: 1:40                                                            MPAA Classification:  No Rating (Mature themes, language)                                                                                                       Starring: Jack Thompson, Russell Crowe, John Polson, Deborah Kennedy            Directors: Geoff Burton and Kevin Dowling                                       Producer: Hal McElroy                                                           Screenplay: David Stevens based on his play                                     Cinematography: Geoff Burton                                                    Music: David Faulkner                                                           Released by The Samuel Goldwyn Company                                                                                                                               Love is perhaps the most common theme explored by movies.  It is           also the most frequently misrepresented.  Many Hollywood love affairs end       up heavily over-romanticized, and the picture they paint is invariably          far from reality.  So it's refreshing to find a film like THE SUM OF US,        which is about love in all its genuine forms:  sexual (both gay and             straight), platonic, and most important, familial.  Given the honesty of        the script, it should come as no surprise that America's film industry          had nothing to do with the movie--this is yet another gem from                  Australia.                                                                                                                                                           Not only are Harry (Jack Thompson) and Jeff (Russell Crowe) father         and son, but they're best friends as well.  Their relationship is relaxed       and comfortable--they banter and kid around and, though they                    occasionally get under each other's skin, there's never any acrimony in         their arguments.  Harry is aware of his son's homosexual preferences and        accepts them unquestioningly.  The only thing he has to say on the              subject is that he's disappointed Jeff will never have an opportunity to        father a child.  With so many dysfunctional family stories around, THE          SUM OF US serves as the perfect antidote.                                                                                                                            Despite his good looks and outgoing personality, Jeff is actually          somewhat shy, as becomes obvious when he's getting to know Greg (John           Polson), a man he meets at a local gay pub.  Greg is no more certain of         himself than Jeff, and it's only after a lot of nervous conversation that       the pair arrive at Jeff's home.  No sooner have the two dimmed the              lights, however, than Harry wanders into the room to greet his son's            prospective lover, unintentionally but effectively dispelling the               romantic atmosphere.                                                                                                                                                 Meanwhile, Harry, who has been a widower for a number of years, is         looking for female companionship.  To that end, he enrolls in Desiree's         Introduction Agency, and is set up with a middle-aged woman named Joyce         (Deborah Kennedy).  The two hit it off almost immediately, but, while           both are interested in pursuing a serious relationship, it's unclear            exactly how far each is willing to go.                                                                                                                               THE SUM OF US is delightful, by turns droll and serious.  Yet even         during its most dramatic moments, it retains a light-hearted tone that          keeps things from becoming too grim. There's always a joke right around         the corner, and none of the humor seems ill-suited to the situation.            Writer David Stevens has a near-perfect sense of his characters, and            they're the sort of people it's a pleasure to get to know.  Strong,             unaffected performances by leads Jack Thompson (who bears a resemblance         to the American sit-com actor Jerry Van Dyke) and Russell Crowe (PROOF,         THE QUICK AND THE DEAD) emphasize our sense of Harry and Jeff as normal,        everyday people.                                                                                                                                                     There is no "fourth wall" in THE SUM OF US.  The characters                frequently turn to the camera--sometimes right in the middle of a               conversation with each other--and address a sentence or two to the              audience.  The words are spoken with such easy familiarity that this            particular device is almost always more effective than gimmicky.                                                                                                     THE SUM OF US isn't exactly cutting-edge, but it takes a few chances       (or what might be perceived as chances by an American viewing audience).        Jeff's homosexuality is a complete non-issue.  There's nothing political        or tragic in his situation.  In fact, he and the other characters               frequently joke about it.  Also, no compromises are made to give the            conclusion an extra lift, proving it's possible to have a happy ending          without undermining the story's intelligence.  It's production elements         like this that make THE SUM OF US such a worthwhile examination of what         love is like for those whose lives don't follow traditional movie               scripts.                                                                                                                                                        -James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                   @START@Review: The Cure                                                                                              THE CURE                                                          A film review by James Berardinelli                                              Copyright 1995 James Berardinelli                                                                                                       RATING (0 TO 10):  4.8                                                                                                                                          U.S. Availability: wide release 4/21/95                                         Running Length: 1:38                                                            MPAA Classification: PG-13 (AIDS themes, language)                                                                                                              Starring: Brad Renfro, Joseph Mazzello, Anabella Sciorra, Diana Scarwid,                  Bruce Davison                                                         Director: Peter Horton                                                          Producers: Mark Burg and Eric Eisner                                            Screenplay: Robert Kuhn                                                         Cinematography: Andrew Dintenfass                                               Music: Dave Grusin                                                              Released by Universal Pictures                                                                                                                                       Forget cancer.  That life-stealer, which has fueled tear-jerkers           from TERMS OF ENDEARMENT to MY LIFE, is passe, its position usurped by          AIDS.  Apparently, PHILADELPHIA was just the tip of the iceberg, and,           if THE CURE is any indication, the American movie-going population may          be on the verge of a deluge.  One problem immediately comes to mind,            however--how the grueling ordeal of the victim can be made palatable            for mass market audiences.  THE CURE offers a possibility, and it's not         a pleasant one, for, as presented in this film, the bane of AIDS offers         a noble, sanitized death.  The Hollywood portrait of suffering here is          in stark contrast to the gut-wrenching reality of SILVERLAKE LIFE:  THE         VIEW FROM HERE, Peter Friedman and Tom Joslin's 1993 documentary about          living with and dying from AIDS.                                                                                                                                     If you're looking for a watered-down AIDS movie that goes for the          easy way out every time, THE CURE is perfect.  It's the kind of                 production that would be at home as a TV after school special.  In the          most pedantic and obvious fashion possible, it ticks off all the                appropriate truths:  people shouldn't be reviled because they have              AIDS, AIDS is not an airborne contagion, you don't have to be gay to            get AIDS, and some gay people are even "nice."  Of course, these are            all valid messages for a motion picture to disseminate to a                     largely-ignorant public, but THE CURE presents them in a preachy and            awkward manner.  Good intentions combined with poor execution don't add         up to much.                                                                                                                                                          The story centers around two neighboring boys:  Erik (Brad Renfro          of THE CLIENT), a loner with a self-absorbed, often-drunk mother (Diana         Scarwid), and Dexter (Joseph Mazzello of JURASSIC PARK and                      SHADOWLANDS), an AIDS victim whose only friend is his loving mom                (Anabella Sciorra).  After a few conversations through a fence, Erik            and Dexter meet face-to- face, the former having to overcome a fear of          getting physically close to someone in Dexter's condition.  However,            following this first meeting, it doesn't take long for the two to               become pals, and their growing friendship leads Erik to help Dexter             begin a search for a cure to rid him of the scourge threatening to              claim his life.                                                                                                                                                      In general, the script, which has a tendency to paint everything           with broad strokes in black and white, is not well-written.  While              there are several scenes that are wonderfully insightful (such as an            incident when Erik and Dexter covertly flip through an issue of                 PLAYBOY, then come into contact with two "real" women), these represent         high points in a screenplay that often relies upon coincidence,                 contrivance, and manipulation.  The ultimate goal of THE CURE is to             wring a few tears from everyone in the audience, and it tries                   everything in pursuit of that aim.                                                                                                                                   Character development proceeds along predictable, and not                  especially deep, lines.  These aren't real people; they've been lifted          from stock.  Does anyone doubt that Erik and Dexter are destined to be          good friends?  Can anyone not see that Dexter's mom will develop                maternal feelings for her son's only buddy?  Is there any doubt that            Erik's mother, the personification of AIDS-paranoia, homophobia, and            alcoholism all-in-one, is actually a reincarnation of the Wicked                Witch?  In fact, actress Diana Scarwid drips so much meanness that she          comes across as laughably absurd.                                                                                                                                    I found one scene in THE CURE somewhat alarming, and possibly a            little irresponsible.  In an instance when Erik and Dexter are menaced          by a knife-wielding bully, the AIDS-infected child calmly slices his            own hand, brandishes the open wound, and intones, "My blood is like             poison." This particular method of fighting back gets the job done--the         man runs away--but it also potentially reinforces several negative              stereotypes about AIDS and AIDS victims.  Is the single camera shot of          cuts on the attacker's arm enough to clue the audience in that                  blood-to-blood contact is necessary for a possible transmission?  Or            will the less-enlightened viewer come away thinking that a drop of HIV+         blood is deadly even if it touches only unbroken skin?                                                                                                               There were plenty of wet eyes at the screening of THE CURE I               attended, which indicates that the movie was accomplishing something.           It does this, however, through shameless and intrusive manipulation             that is less concerned about emotional honesty than pulling strings.            Had the characters been more than thinly-sketched types and had the             story contained a few more of those "special" moments of bonding                between the two children, THE CURE might have been a heartwarming,              heartbreaking tale.  As it is, this film left me longing for another            viewing of SILVERLAKE LIFE or, failing that, PHILADELPHIA.  Both                present the same themes as THE CURE, but in a manner that is both               poignant and effective.                                                                                                                                         -James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com)                                   @START@Video Coming Attractions                                                 ***************************************************************                 * WELCOME TO KING VIDEO'S COMING ATTRACTIONS!

Despite all the U.N.'s problems with international peace-       keeping, the advocates of world government are busier than ever.                                                                                                  At the so-called World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen,           Denmark, last month, some 10,000 delegates from more than 140 countries         debated plans for a world government financed by global taxes and other         revenues totalling $1.5 trillion over five years. Provisions call for           creation of a "global human security fund" to finance a World Ministry of       Agriculture, a World Ministry of Industry, a World Ministry of Social           Affairs and a World Police Department.                                                                                                                            While the Republican-led Congress is unlikely to go along with any such       globalism, the Copenhagen Summit was addressed in supportive terms by both      Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Next on the       U.N.'s timetable is a World Summit of Children in June, followed by the         Fourth World Conference of Women in Beijing, China, in September, and a         gala commemoration of the U.N.'s 50th anniversary next October in San           Francisco.                                                                                                                                                        Awe-struck observers might well ask, what's next? Well, there already         have been a whole series of U.N. conferences on world population, held in       Cairo last September; on human rights, conducted in Vienna in 1993; and the     famous Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June, 1992, attended by Vice Presi-    dent Gore, among others. The Rio conference produced what's called the          Convention of Biological Diversity. Its stated purpose is to "protect the       variability among all living organisms and species...." Critics have called     the treaty a quantum leap in environmental radicalism, allowing international   bureaucrats to intrude into the day-to-day activities of American farmers,      ranchers and businessmen, and to impose regulations governing them. President   Bush refused to sign on, but President Clinton has submitted the treaty to      the Senate for ratification. Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate        Foreign Relations Committee, is among lawmakers demanding major revisions       to protect U.S. interests before any further consideration.                                                                                                       There's more. Also out there, waiting for Senate ratification, is the         "Convention of the Law of the Sea." It establishes an International Seabed      Authority to regulate private mining of the ocean floor. An entity called       the Enterprise would be empowered to develop the seabed resources for the       benefit of all mankind. Western countries and companies would provide the       necessary funds and technology. Critics see it as part of a "New Interna-       tional Economic Order" aimed at promoting the redistribution of global          resources, technology and wealth.                                                                                                                                 Nor is this all. Also awaiting Senate ratification is a U.N. Convention       on the Rights of the Child, drawn up by a 1990 world summit hosted by the       U.N.'s Children's Emergency Fund, or UNICEF.  Presidents Reagan and Bush        declined to sign the treaty as an infringement both on U.S. sovereignty         and on parental authority.  However, last February Hillary Clinton served       notice that President Clinton would sign the treaty and send it to the          Senate for ratification.                                                                                                                                          Not so fast, says Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum and a            leading opponent of "one-worldism." Warns Mrs. Schlafly: "This outrageous       U.N. treaty is designed to take children away from the protection of their      parents, put children under the authority of U.N. `experts,' give children      the legal rights of adults, and set up government lawyers to sue parents        to assert the child's `rights.'"                                                                                                                                  Citing the treaty's dangers, Mrs. Schlafly asks parents: "Do you want         the U.N. to have the power to tell your minor children that they have the       `right' to refuse to do their homework? Or the `right' to watch TV when you     tell them to turn it off? Or the `freedom of religion' to refuse to go          church with you? Or the `right' to refuse to clean up their room and carry      out the garbage?"                                                                                                                                                 The answers are obvious. National Review, the conservative magazine,          calls the Rights of the Child treaty "the mother of all mandates." It cites     a number of "horror stories" from Great Britain, which signed the treaty        four years ago.  For example, a U.N."enforcement" committee is on record        against parents who "chastise" their children. In response, the British         government has felt obliged to ask if "a light smack" would be permissible!                                                                                       Concludes National Review: "The U.S. Senate should slam-dunk this             globocratic nonsense."                                                                                                                                          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------    Behind the Headlines, written by Philip C.

But an important new book reveals that the                   Founding Fathers had a slightly different view on the subject.                                                                                                    The First Amendment to the Constitution contains these well-known             words: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of               religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...." And through             the early part of the nation's history, this phrase was taken to mean           that the federal government could not establish a state religion, nor           could it limit religious practices. But over the past 30 years or so,           the courts have gradually altered this interpretation so as to literally        divorce religion and matters of faith from anything at all in the public        domain. And it's a change for the worse, says M. Stanton Evans, author          of a new book entitled, The Theme is Freedom: Religion, Politics and            the American Tradition.                                                                                                                                           Evans poses the question: "Was the First Amendment really intended            to build a `wall of separation' between the church and state?"                  His answer: "History is clear: it was not. The Founding Fathers                 wanted to protect religion from federal government interference,                not diminish its influence in our public life." With meticulous                 research, Evans demonstrates that the Founding Fathers were very                religious men. Even Ben Franklin, whose reputation casts him as a               lovable rogue, had a deeply held religious faith. The author quotes             Franklin's words: "The longer I live, the more convincing proof I               see of this truth - that God governs in the affairs of men."                                                                                                      Indeed, as Evans reveals, the Founding Fathers were so devoutly               religious that many of them supported state-sponsored churches.                 Nine of the 13 colonies had officially "established" a church,                  meaning that the government recognized a particular denomination as             having rights and privileges that others did not have, including                subsidies paid from tax revenues. But growing religious diversity               in the colonies made many of the Founding Fathers reconsider the                wisdom of an official church. And, as Evans notes, in 1785, before              adoption of the Constitution, James Madison co-sponsored a bill in              the Virginia legislature to "disestablish" the Protestant Episcopal             Church and forbid taxes from being used to support any church.                                                                                                    Evan goes on to say that this trend to disestablish churches did              not mean the Founding Fathers were enemies of religious matters.                Indeed, the Continental Congress had a chaplain and opened its                  first session with a prayer, as does today's Congress. And, Evans               adds, "in 1780, in the midst of Revolutionary conflict, the                     Congress also took steps to print an American Bible, as the supply              from England had been cut off." He also reveals that the very words of          the First Amendment were written by a committee that contained                  "two members from Connecticut's state established Congregational                Church."                                                                                                                                                          Evans also recalls that the Founding Fathers believed the federal             government had no power to regulate religion, but that states                   did have such power. In Thomas Jefferson's second inaugural                     address, for example, the third president said that "in matters of              religion, he had `left them, as the Constitution found them, under              the direction and discipline of State or Church authorities                     acknowledged by the several religious societies.'" Evans reports                that Jefferson's views were based on the Tenth Amendment, as well               as on the First. In the latter amendment, the Founders wrote that               "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,             nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States                  respectively, or to the people."                                                                                                                                  As Evans sums up: "The conclusion seems irresistible: that no                 wall of separation between religious affirmation and civil                      government was intended by the First Amendment. The wall of                     separation was between the federal government and the states. "We               have come to a day," he concludes, "when a child's mention of God               in a graduation address or the presence of a Nativity scene in                  a public place triggers threats of legal action. This is a gross                distortion of our Constitutional history and a dishonor to our                  Founders."

Yet, very few realize the          tremendous impact that taxation has had on civilization. Charles Adams          changes that in this facinating history. Taxation, says Adams, has been         a catalyst of history, the powerful influence if not the direct cause of        many of the famous events of history that have marched across the               world's stage as empires collided and battled for the right to tax the          loser. For Good And Evil is the first book to examine how taxation has          been a key factor in world events. Like the Rosetta Stone - a tax               document - the book sheds fresh light onto much of history.                                                                                                     Did you know that biblical Israel split after Solomon's death because           his son refused to cut taxes? That Rome rose to greatness due to a              liberal tax regime but declined under corrupt and inefficient ones? That        in Britain, Lady Godiva made her famous ride as a tax protest? That in          Switzerland William Tell shot an apple off his son's head as punishment         for tax resistance? Or that Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the           Civil War were fired, was a Customs House?                                                                                                                      Combining facts with thought-provoking comment he frequently draws              parallels between tax events of the past and those of the present.              Finding fault with the way Western civilization is taxed, Adams provides        ideas for curing those faults by using the valuable lessons that history        has taught. The special value of this refreshing new look at history            lies in the lessons to be drawn by all thinking taxpayers. "Taxes are           the fuel that makes civilization run, but how we tax and spend                  determines to a large extent whether we are prosperous or poor, free or         enslaved, and most importantly, good or evil." Once you read For Good           And Evil, you'll never feel the same about taxes!                               @START@History repeating itself...

To date, only 27 amendments have                    	become part of the founding document, including the first                      	ten known as the Bill of Rights.                                                                                                                               	The swiftest passage came for the 26th Amendment, which                        	lowered the voting age from 21 to 18.  Proposed by Congress                    	on March 23, 1971, its ratification by the states was com-                     	pleted on July 1, 1971.                                                                                                                                        	By contrast, it took 203 years to pass the 27th Amendment,                     	which in essence directs that Congress cannot pass immedi-                     	ate pay raises for itself.

Lee                                                                                                                                             Though far from complete, the following record demonstrates the                 extent to which the United Nations has, since its founding in                   1945, worked to pull down the economic, political, and moral                    pillars on which the American Republic was built:                                                                                                               APRIL 25, 1945.  The United Nations founding conference convened                in San Francisco with U.S. State Department official Alger Hiss                 serving as Secretary-General.  Hiss, a Soviet spy, would eventually             be convicted of perjury for lying about his pro-Soviet activities.                                                                                              FEBRUARY 6, 1946.  The Senate confirmed Assistant Secretary of the              Treasury Harry Dexter White to be executive director for the United             States of the UN's International Monetary Fund (IMF).  White served             as chairman of the committee that established the IMF.  In November             1953, Attorney General Herbert Brownell confirmed during a speech in            Chicago that White, like Hiss, was a Soviet spy.  Brownell asserted             that "the records in my department show that White's spying activi-             ties for the Soviet government were reported in detail by the FBI               to the White House...in December of 1945.  In the face of this infor-           mation, and incredible though it may seem, President Truman subse-              quently on January 23, 1946 nominated White" to the IMF post.                                                                                                   SEPTEMBER 8, 1954.  The Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty was            signed by the eight participating nations, including the United                 States.  The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), is a region-           al subsidiary of the UN, later served as the primary "legal" justifi-           cation for U.S. involvement in Vietnam.  Writing in the New York                Times for March 2, 1966, C. L. Sulzberger revealed that former Secre-           tary of State John Foster Dulles "fathered SEATO with the deliberate            purpose, as he explained to me, of providing the U.S. President with            legal authority to intervene in Indochina."  After the war, which               formally ended with a communist victory on April 30, 1975, SEATO,               having served its purpose, was disbanded (February 1976).                                                                                                       SEPTEMBER 13, 1961.  The UN launched Operation Morthor, a full-scale            military invasion of the independent, anti-communist province of                Katanga in the former Belgian Congo.  The UN assault included the               bombing of hospitals, attacks on ambulances, and general violence so            extreme that the 46 civilian doctors of Katanga's capital of Eliza-             bethville issued the book-length report 46 ANGRY MEN which, accompan-           ied by pictorial examples of UN atrocities, documented the horror that          the UN inflicted in the name of "peace."                                                                                                                        SEPTEMBER 25, 1961.  President John F. Kennedy presented the U.S.               disarmament plan, subsequently published as State Department Publica-           tion 7277 (Freedom From War: The United States Program for General              and Complete Disarmament in a Peaceful World), the ultimate aim of              which is the creation of a world order in which "no state would have            the military power to challenge the progressively strengthened U.N.             Peace Force...."  The treasonous policy outlined in this sovereignty-           destroying document remains in effect to the present.                                                                                                           NOVEMBER 11, 1965.  Rhodesia declared its independence from Great               Britain, and the UN General Assembly immediately branded it "a threat           to international peace and security."  On December 16, 1966, the                Security Council voted to impose mandatory sanctions (for the first             time in UN history), which the Johnson Administration promptly endors-          ed. In 1971, Congress approved an amendment allowing the U.S. to                import strategic materials from communist nations, but repealed the             amendment in 1977.  On April 18, 1980, Rhodesia officially expired,             becoming the Marxist-ruled nation of Zimbabwe.  UN sanctions were               lifted and by late September the U.S. and other Western countries had           pledged more than $300 million in aid to the new communist regime               led by terrorist Robert Mugabe.                                                                                                                                 OCTOBER 25, 1971.  The General Assembly voted to admit Mao Tse-tung's           Red China into the UN, and ousted Nationalist (Free) China.  In an              unprecedented move, Secretary-General Thant subsequently expelled               Free China's press representatives from UN headquarters.  The 1975              edition of The Guinness Book of World Records reported that the                 "greatest massacre in human history ever attributed to any nation               is that of 26,300,000 Chinese during the regime of Mao Tse-tung be-             tween 1949 and May, 1965."                                                                                                                                      APRIL 16, 1974.  The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) announced          plans to aid communist North Vietnam and areas held by the Vietcong in          the South.  The program, described in a report by UNICEF director Henry         Labouisse, called for $18 million of the $22.5 million amount to be             spent in the North.                                                                                                                                             NOVEMBER 13, 1974.  Yasir Arafat, leader of the terrorist Palistine             Liberation Organization (PLO), addressed the UN General Assembly.  It           was the first time that a representative of any group lacking offcial           UN status had appeared before the assembly.  In subsequent months,              the PLO was invited to participate in many UN agencies, and the UN              announced on October 7, 1978 that its Secretariat had launched a                $500,000 publicity campaign to, among other things, create a moderate           image for the PLO in the United States and other Western countries.                                                                                             APRIL 2, 1992.  The U.S. Senate ratified the United Nations Covenant on         Civil and Political Rights, many provisions of which are diametrically          opposed to tenets of our own Bill of Rights.  Article 20, for instance,         requires states "to prohibit by law any propaganda for war and any              advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incite-       ment to discrimination, hostility or violence."  In the United States,          the right to preach, print, and propagandize even wrong-headed views            has been one of our most cherished and vigorously defended freedoms.                                                                                            JULY 1993.  The UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) granted consul-         tive status to the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA),            a coalition which includes the North American Man-Boy Love Association          (NAMBLA).  NAMBLA promotes pedophilia and advocates sex with children           as young as six years old.  On January 26, 1994, the U.S. Senate unani-         mously voted to withhold $118.8 million in fiscal year 1994, and in             1995 if necessary, from the U.S. annual contribution to the UN unless           ECOSOC severed its ties with ILGA.  In September 1994, ECOSOC did               indeed suspend ILGA, but only until the homosexual group proves that            it has in turn cut ties with NAMBLA and any other groups that condone,          promote, or seek to legalize adult-child sexual relations.

Hoar                                                                                                                                        Halloween trick or treating and greeting cards are what most Americans          think about when they hear the name UNICEF.  The greeting card operation        alone, according to a recent Yearbook of the United Nations, brings in          an annual take of $76.6 million.  But behind the marketing facade that          supposedly raises funds for international child welfare programs is an          agenda to augment the power and influence of global government.                                                                                                 UNICEF specifically supports, as noted in its State of the World's Child-       ren, 1994, "sustainable development following the guidelines of Agenda 21,      the blueprint for the world's environment agreed to at the 'Earth Summit'       in Rio de Janeiro in 1992."  An Agenda 21 document acknowledges that it         "proposes an array of actions which are intended to be implemented by           every person on earth...."                                                                                                                                      One outgrowth of UNICEF's 1990 World Summit for children was the Convention     on the Rights of the Child.  It was pushed through in 1990, has 176 signa-      tories, but has yet to be ratified by the United States.  Hillary Clinton       announced at a memorial service for James Grant, the late head of UNICEF,       that the U.S. would, in his honor, sign the world pact and send it to the       Senate for ratification.                                                                                                                                        Proponents argue that the plight of children is so ghastly as to require        that there be an immediate world "right" to protect them; but they also         insist that the resultant "protections" (at least in the U.S.) would be so      meaningless that no one should worry about any changes that might occur.        Are we to believe that global power grabbers would spend so much effort on      empty symbolism?                                                                                                                                                Former UN consultant Graham Hancock points out in his book, The Lords of        Poverty: The Power, Prestige and Corruption of the International Aid            Business, that "personnel and associated costs" absorb some "80 percent of      all UN expenditures," with UNICEF and other "humanitarian" agencies spending    an inordinate amount on self-promotion.                                                                                                                         But in view of some of the "beneficiaries" of UNICEF aid, the inordinate        administration cost is not necessarily bad news.  Consider the help given       the communists in Vietnam (or substitute other dictatorships for similar        results).  As Robert Heinl of the Detroit News commented in a May 1975          column called "UNICEF Aided Vietnam Fall":                                                                                                                      	Last fall when you gave the kids trick-or-treat money for                      	UNICEF Christams cards, did it occur that you, and behind                      	you, the U.S. Government, were bankrolling the Communist                       	takeover of South Vietnam"                                                                                                                                     	Well, you were....

Here's more recent notoriety: Auditors for UNICEF itself have found it          necessary to criticize the agency's propensity for bribery payments -           sometimes euphemistically called "salary supplements" or "commissions."         According to a UN audit conducted for the auditors general of Britain,          Ghana, and India, "the practice appears to be widespread among United           Nations organizations, multilateral and bilateral organizations and non-        governmental organizations."                                                                                                                                    The problems of bribery, reported the New York Times for December 25, 1994,     are "particularly pervasive" in Africa.  However, the most bothersome thing     seems not to be the amount of bribery, nor the principle.  Such payments,       commented the Times, "divert money from development efforts and pose the        risk of steadily increasing.  Indeed, the auditors did not stress the amount    involved but rather the potential threat to programs."                                                                                                          In other words, if the complicity with bribery and graft becomes known, the     scam might suffer and globalizing efforts be set back.  The plight of           children remains part of the shell game.

The Russian general had              served in the Russian army since the Russian Revolution.  He had                fought hard and valiantly in the successful defense of Moscow.  It              was only because of Stalin's refusal to permit Vlasov and his men to            retreat during the subsequent battle at Leningrad that the German               forces had defeated and captured Vlasov.  It was difficult for Hitler           to believe that Vlasov was now willing to lead captured Russian                 soldiers against Stalin and his communist regime.                                                                                                               So, it was not until the very end of the war - January 1945 - that              Hitler finally relented and permitted Vlasov to lead Russian POWs               into battle against the Russian army.  But by this time, Germany was            close to defeat.  The forces under Vlasov's command - some 50,000               Russian soldiers - played a minor military role in the war.                                                                                                     Ironically, Vlasov's forces did have one very interesting military              victory.  The Czech underground sought their assistance in helping              to liberate Czechoslovakia from Nazi control!  Vlasov, who despised             the Nazis as much as he hated the communists, agreed to help.  The              Saturday Evening Post later reported:                                                                                                                           	Prague really was liberated by foreign troops, after all.                      	Not by the Allies who did not arrive until the shooting                        	was all over, but by 22,000 Russian outlaws wearing German                     	uniforms.  The leader of these renegades was General Vlasov,                   	a former hero of the Red Army.                                                                                                                                 The battlefield was obviously chaotic.  The Russians were approaching           from the east.  The Americans and British were approaching from the west.       Vlasov and his forces were in the middle, the German forces were at his         back.                                                                                                                                                           On May 7, 1945, Germany capitulated.                                                                                                                            Vlasov knew that Stalin was not a forgiving man.  After his capture,            Vlasov had openly defied the communists and communism.  He had tried            to arouse the Russian people to revolt against their communist tyrants.         Vlasov knew that capture meant certain death for him and his men.                                                                                               Andrey Vlasov chose to surrender to American forces.  He did not know           that Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Winston Churchill, and             Joseph Stalin had already sealed his fate.  He did not know that these          four rulers of the Allied powers had already committed themselves to            one of the worst holocausts in history.  He did not know that evil              pervaded not only the Nazi and communist regimes, but the American and          British regimes, as well.                                                                                                                                       Part of the Yalta Agreement between the Big Three - Stalin, Roosevelt,          and Churchill - involved the repatriation of Russians and Americans to          their respective homelands.  Keep in mind that the German POW camps             contained American prisoners, British prisoners, and Russian prisoners.         The Big Three agreed that as the Russians liberated Germany POW camps.          American and British POWs would be turned over to the American and              British forces.  As the Americans and British liberated German POW              camps, Russian POWs would be returned to Russia.                                                                                                                There was one problem with this agreement - a problem that each of the          Big Three was well aware of.  American and British POWs wanted to return        to their own forces.  RUSSIAN POWS DID NOT WANT TO RETURN TO RUSSIAN            FORCES BECAUSE THEY KNEW THE FATE THAT AWAITED THEM.                                                                                                            Stalin wanted revenge.  The Russian prisoners were traitors to                  communism.  They deserved to die.                                                                                                                               And Roosevelt and Churchill felt the exact same way.  Russia was "our           friend."  Stalin was "Uncle Joe" to the American people.  Any Russian           who had defied Uncle Joe - any Russian who had opposed our communist            friends and allies - deserved to be executed.                                                                                                                   The revenge and ensuing holocaust had to be kept secret from the world.         The American and British people had to continue maintaining their               illusion that this was a war of good versus evil - that only the Nazis          engaged in cold-blooded murder - that the Allies epitomized all the             goodness of mankind.                                                                                                                                            Therefore, the Big Three spelled out their plans not just in the official       Yalta agreement but, also, in a March 31, 1945, secret codicil to the           agreement.  As James Sanders, Mark Sauter, and R. Cort Kirkwood point out       in their shooking book, Soldiers of Misfortune (1992), the codicil was          kept secret from the American and British people for FIFTY YEARS.  The          codicil outlined the secret plan by which the Russian POWs would be             forcibly returned to Stalin's clutches.                                                                                                                         American government officials called their part in the holocaust Operation      Keelhaul.  In his book Operation Keelhaul (1973), Julius Epstein described      the meaning of the term:                                                                                                                                        	To keelhaul is the cruelest and most dangerous of                              	punishments and tortures ever devised for men aboard                           	a ship.  It involves trussing a man up with ropes,                             	throwing him overboard, unable to swim, and hauling                            	him under the boat's kell from one side to the other,                          	or even from stem to stern.  Most of those keelhauled                          	under water are already dead when their punishment is                          	over.                                                                                                                                                          And Epstein describes his reaction to the choice of this term by American       government officials to describe their part in the Allied holocaust:                                                                                            	That our Armed Forces should have adopted this term as its                     	code name for deporting by brutal force to concentration                       	camp, firing squad, or hangman's noose millions who were                       	already in the lands of freedom, shows how little the high                     	brass thought of their longing to be free.                                                                                                                     The roles played by each of the conspirators was clear: Roosevelt and           Churchill would force the Russian anticommunists into Stalin's hands.           The communists would take over from there and do the actual killing.                                                                                            How many were turned over to the Russians by American and British forces?       TWO MILLION INDIVIDUALS.  Yes, two million Russian people sent back to          the communists where they were either immediately executed or sent to           die in the Gulag.                                                                                                                                               It was not easy to "persuade" the Russian prisoners to return to the            communists.  Sometimes, subterfuge was used.  Epstein details several           examples.  One took place on May 28, 1945, in Lienz, Austria.  British          forces ordered all Cossack officials to attend an important British             conference with high British officials.  The Cossacks were told to leave        their coats since they would be back by six in the evening.  Their              famalies were advised so that family members would not worry over their         short absence.  When the Cossacks appeared nervous, an English officer          told them, "I assure you on my word of honor as a British officer that          you are just going to a conference."                                                                                                                            The 2,749 Cossacks - 2,201 of whom were officers - were driven straight         into a prison camp and were advised by British officials that the               Soviet authorities would soon arrive to pick them up.  Epstein writes:                                                                                          	One Cosack officer remarked: "The NKVD or the Gestapo                          	would have slain us with truncheons, the British did                           	it with their word of honor."  The first to commit                             	suicide by hanging was the Cossack editor Evgenji                              	Tarruski.  The second was General Silkin who shot                              	himself....The Cossacks refused to board [the trucks].                         	British soldiers with pistols and clubs began using                            	their clubs, aiming at the heads of the prisoners.                             	They first dragged the men out of the crowd and threw                          	them into the trucks.  The men jumped out.  They beat                          	them again and threw them onto the floor of the trucks.                        	Again, they jumped out.  The British then hit them with                        	rifle butts until they lay unconscious and threw them                          	like sacks of potatoes in the trucks.                                                                                                                          The same scenes were repeated all along the lines - two million Russian         people tricked and beaten by British and American forces so that Stalin         could finish the job later on.                                                                                                                                  Some of this dirty work even took place on American soil.  Epstein              describes what happened to Russian POWs who were imprisoned at Fort             Dix, New Jersey:                                                                                                                                                	First, they refused to leave their barracks when ordered                       	to do so.  The military police then used tear gas, and,                        	half-dazed, the prisoners were driven under heavy guard                        	to the harbor where they were forced to board a Soviet                         	vessel.  Here the two hundred immediately started to fight.                    	They fought with their bare hands.  They started - with                        	considerable success - to destroy the ship's engines....                       	A sergeant...mixed barbiturates into their coffee.  Soon,                      	all of the prisoners fell into a deep, coma-like sleep.                        	It was in this condition that the prisoners were brought                       	to another Soviet boat for a speedy return to Stalin's                         	hangmen.                                                                                                                                                       Andrey Vlasov - the man who hated communism - the man who hated Nazism -        carefully explained his position and reasoning to the American generals.        In his book Vlasov, Sven Steenberg describes Vlasov's conversation with         one of his American captors:                                                                                                                                    	He began to speak, at first slowly and dispassionately,                        	but then with growing intensity.  For one last time, he                        	spoke of all the prospects, hopes, and disappointments                         	of his countrymen.  He summed up everything for which                          	countless Russians had fought and suffered.  It was no                         	longer really to the American that he was addressing                           	himself - this was rather a confession, a review of his                        	life, a last protest against the destiny that had                              	brought him to a wretched end....[Vlasov] stated that                          	the leaders of the ROA were ready to appear before an                          	international court, but that it would be a monumental                         	injustice to turn them over to the Soviets and thereby                         	to certain death.  It was not a question of volunteers                         	who had served the Germans, but of a political organiza-                       	tion, of a broad opposition movement which, in any event,                      	should not be dealt with under military law.                                                                                                                   Vlasov could not know that he was a dead man before he even surrendered         to American forces.  Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, and Truman had already       decided that he needed to be executed for the "crime" of betraying his own      government.  There was no need to go through the time, expense, trouble,        and possible embarrassment of a trial.  All that needed to be done was          for the Americans to turn him over to their friendly executioner, "Uncle        Joe" Stalin.                                                                                                                                                    American military officials delivered Andrey Vlasov to Soviet military          authorities.  On August 2, 1946, the Soviet press reported that Andrey          Vlasov had been hanged by Soviet officials for "treason as well as              active espionage and terrorist activity against the Soviet Union."                                                                                              Unfortunately, all of the facts of the forcible repatriation of the             Russian anticommunists have not been revealed.  American and British            government officials take the position that "national security" will            be jeopardized if the citizenry is ever permitted to know all of the            details of the Allied holocaust.  Thus, fifty years after world War II,         American "adults" are still not permitted by their public officials to          see the government's files and records on America's involvement in the          "good war" and, specifically, in the Allied holocaust.                                                                                                          As with most claims of "national security," the concern is not so much          with the security of the nation but rather with the security of the U.S.        government and, specifically, the U.S. military-industrial complex.  For        it is entirely possible that the American people will finally pierce            through all the lies and deceptions that have clouded their minds since         the first grade in public schools to which their parents were forced to         send them.  It is quite possible that they will recognize the wisdom of         their Founding Fathers - and see that the biggest threat to their well-         being lies not with some foreign government, but rather with their own          government.                                                                                                                                                     Was the Allied holocaust the end of the repatriation story?  Unfortunately,     no.  the last chapter of Stalin's, Roosevelt's, Truman's, and Churchill's       horrid tale of deception, brutality, and murder involves Americans              "liberated" from German POW camps by the Russians - and the role played in      this chapter by the U.S. government, the same government that has always        insisted that the American people "support the troops."

On February 29, 1992, U.S. Army Colonel Albert C. Zapanta                      	returned to the United States after a six-month tour of                        	duty with a UN peacekeeping force in Western Sahara.  One                      	of 30 Americans sent there to monitor an election, Zapanta                     	had complained about being neglected by the UN, threatened                     	by neighboring Moroccans, and forced to live under danger-                     	ous circumstances.                                                                                                                                             	A Senate Foreign Affairs African subcommittee sought to hear                   	Zapanta's testimony about his ordeal.  But State Department                    	officials barred his appearance because a UN regulation for-                   	bids those who serve in UN missions to give information to                     	national legislatures, even their own.  The U.S. had already                   	contributed $43.3 million for this mission.

It can't be repeated too often that, in the Declaration of                  	Independence, our Founding Fathers asserted the revolution-                    	ary and "self evident" truth that "men...are endowed by their                  	Creator with certain unalienable Rights."  The Founders went                   	on to assert, "to secure these Rights, Governments are insti-                  	tuted among Men."  Note the logical sequence: 1) God exists;                   	2) God creates man and endows him with rights; and 3) Man                      	creates government to protect those rights.  The individual                    	precedes and is superior to government.

Kornfeder, revealed        in 1955:                                                                                                                                                            Now, as to the United Nations.  If you were, let's say, a building              engineer, and someone were to show you a set of blueprints about a              certain building, you would know from those blueprints how that                 building was going to look.  Organization "blueprints" can be read              the same way.  I need not be a member of the United Nations Secretar-           iat to know that the UN "blueprint" is a Communist one.  I was at the           Moscow headquarters of the world Communist party for nearly three               years and was acquainted with most of the top leaders, and, of course,          I was also a leading party worker.  I went to their colleges; I                 learned their pattern of operations, and if I see that pattern in               effect anywhere, I can recognize it...                                                                                                                          From the point of view of its master designers meeting at Dumbarton             Oaks and Bretton Woods, and which included such masterful agents as             Alger Hiss, Harry Dexter White, Lauchlin Currie, and others, the UN             was, and is, NOT a failure.  They and the Kremlin masterminds behind            them never intended the UN as a peace-keeping organization.  What               they had in mind was a fancy and colossal Trojan horse under the                wings of which their smaller agencies could more effectively operate.           And in that they succeeded, even beyond their expectations...                                                                                                   Its [the UN's] internal setup, Communist designed, is a pattern for             sociological conquest; a pattern aimed to serve the purpose of                  Communist penetration of the West.  It is ingenious and deceptive. [12]                                                                                     Two years earlier (1953), a congressional committee heard testimony from        Colonel Jan Bukar, a Czechoslovakian intelligence officer who had defected      to the West.  Among revelations he supplied was a lecture given by Soviet       General Bondarenko at the Frunze Military Academy in Moscow.  In that lecture,  Bondarenko told the elite trainees: "From the rostrum of the United Nations,    we shall convince the colonial and semicolonial people to liberate themselves   and to spread the Communist theory all over the world." [13]                                                                                                    -----------------------                                                         p.72                                                                                                                                                            Among the many defectors from the communist bloc countries who have testified   about the importance of the UN in the Soviet scheme of things is former KGB     operative Ladislav Bittman.  In his book THE KGB AND SOVIET DISINFORMATION:     AN INSIDER'S VIEW, Bittman wrote:                                                                                                                                   The United Nations is an international organization that deserves               special attention for the role it plays in overt and clandestine                propaganda campaigns conducted by the Soviets.  As an organization              that helps to shape world public opinion and plays a vital peace-               keeping role, the United Nations is a major battlefield for the                 Soviet union and the United States...But the Soviet Union maintains             the most impressive intelligence organization, consisting of the                largest single concentration of Soviet spies anywhere in the West...            Spying in New York is so pervasive that some diplomats refer to the             United Nations as "the stock exchange of global intelligence                    operations." [27]                                                                                                                                           Arkady Shevchenko, who was an under-secretary-general at the UN when he         defected in 1978, has described the United Nations as a "gold mine for          Russian spying." [28]  The most senior official to defect to the West,          Shevchenko was a personal assistant to Soviet Foreign Secretary Andrei          Gromyko from 1970 to 1973.  He then became Under-Secreatry-General for          Political and Security Council Affairs at the United Nations.  Shevchenko       confirmed what anti-communists had been saying all along: The Soviet            Politburo regarded detente as simply "a tactical manoeuvre which would in       no way supersede the Marxist-Leninist idea of the final victory of the          worldwide revolutionary process." [29]  And the United Nations was continu-     ing to play an essential role in that process.                                                                                                                  "In spite of this and other exposures," said Pincher in 1985, "the Inter-       national Department and the KGB have not reduced the scale of their opera-      tions out of the United Nations and its offshoots, being unable to resist       the facility, denied to ordinary diplomats, that renders UN staff free to       travel, without restriction, in the countries where they are based." [30]                                                                                       KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky gave a similar assessment:                                                                                                             The size of the KGB presence in both the United States and the UN               delegation in New York increased more rapidly at the height of                  detente than at any other period: from about 120 officers in 1970               to 220 in 1975.  At the very moment when the London residency was               being sharply cut back, those in the United States were almost                  doubling in size. [31]                                                                                                                                      It should be of no small concern to American taxpayers to learn that they       have been subsidizing these KGB campaigns of espionage, subversion, and         disinformation against their own country.  In his massive 1964 study,           KGB: THE SECRET WORK OF SOVIET SECRET AGENTS, John Barron revealed:                                                                                                 The KGB derives still another advantage from placing its officers               on the United Nations payroll.  Since the United States pays 25                 percent of the entire U.N. operating budget, it pays 25 percent                 of the bountiful salaries granted KGB officers insinuated into U.N.             jobs.  American taxpayers thus are compelled to finance KGB opera-              tions against themselves and the noncommunist world.  Moreover, the             Soviet Union requires its citizens paid by international organizations          to rebate the greater part of their salaries to the government.  Thus,          it actually makes money each time it plants a KGB officer in the U.N. [32]                                                                                  --------------------------                                                      p.75                                                                                                                                                            The KGB has undergone a number of recent permutations, but to paraphrase        Mark Twain, reports of its death are highly exaggerated.  Zdzislaw Rurarz,      the former Polish ambassador to Japan who defected to the United States in      1981, was one of the few Soviet experts to take notice of Boris Yeltsin's       sinister new security superagency, the MSIA.  Rurarz reported in January        1992 that Boris's MSIA "is an amalgam of four previously existing institu-      tions:  the USSR MVD, or the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Russian MVD,     the ISS, or Interrepublican Security Service, which was mainly the former       KGB, and the FSA, the Federal Security Agency, or the Russian equivalent        of the former KGB."                                                                                                                                             "The MSIA has inherited the network of informers and collaborators of the       former KGB and ISS which was in place throughout the USSR.  Why," asks          Rurarz, "should Russia need such a network in the remaining former Soviet       republics, now 'independent states'?" [37]  An obvious question - that          yields an obvious answer - except to "liberals" who are too busy planning       new welfare schemes on which to spend the "peace dividend," and to "conser-     vatives" who are too busy celebrating and congratulating themselves on          their victory over communism.                                                                                                                                   Commenting on the Kremlin security reshuffling, Albert L. Weeks wrote in        April 1992 that the "new" Russian agency under Viktor Barannikov "means that    500,000 officials and informers function today as a separate entity, going      about their business largely as before.  Thousands of other ex-KGBists work     for Yevgeny Primakov, director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Agency."     Dr. Weeks, professor emeritus of New York University and author of numerous     articles and books about the Soviet Union, also noted that "90-95% of middle-   ranking KGB officers remain in the same positions as before the August, 1991,   coup attempt, according to a recent defector...."

Representative Richard Pombo (R-CA) recalls his deep sense of                   responsibility as he and his colleagues took that oath in                       January 1993.  He remembers being filled with pride, gratitude,                 and an awe as a newly elected congressman.  Pride in being                      able to stand as a member of such an august body.  Gratitude                    to those who had sent him as their representative.  And awe                     because he was now standing where so many remarkable Americans                  of the past had stood to "faithfully discharge the duties"                      of their office.                                                                                                                                                SAD AWAKENING                                                                                                                                                   But his pride changed to sadness and anger at an incident that                  occurred immediately after the oath had been administered.                      Congressman Pombo recalls:                                                                                                                                  	We had no sooner completed the oath when one of my                             	colleagues rose to ask that full congressional voting                          	privileges be given to the non-voting delegates from                           	Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Puerto Rico,                         	and the District of Columbia.  His opening words                               	astounded me.  He said that he considered the matter                           	"one of fairness, not of constitutionality."                                                                                                                   	He obviously knew that the Constitution requires that                          	members of Congress come from the "states."  And he                            	also knew that the District of Columbia and the                                	territories were not states.  Yet he was calling on                            	all of us to disregard this eminently clear portion of                         	the document and to place his definition of "fairness"                         	above the Constitution.                                                                                                                                        	this was my chilling introduction to service in the                            	U.S. House of Representatives.  The chamber's walls                            	were still echoing the solemn oath taken by each of                            	us when one member asked us to disregard it.  The oath                         	he had taken was a formality for him; its real                                 	meaning obviously counted for nothing.                                                                                                                             NECESSARY CORRECTION                                                                                                                                            Last September, more than 300 Republican House candidates and                   incumbents signed their party's "Contract with America."  It                    mentions the Constitution only twice: to call for amendments                    and to discount claims that some of the "Contract" violates                     the Constitution.                                                                                                                                               One of the most well-known features of the GOP "Contract" is                    its call for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced                    budget.  Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and many                   others in Congress would have Americans believe that the                        Constitution is deficient, and that enormous deficits can be                    combated in no other way but by amendment.  But the Constitution                isn't deficient; Congress is.  And the House that Gingrich now                  leads is where proper corrective action can and should be taken.                                                                                                Article I, Section 7 begins: "All bills for raising revenues                    shall originate in the House..."  If the House won't introduce                  a bill to spend, there is nothing the Senate, the President,                    the courts, or anyone can do about it.                                                                                                                          Therefore, Gingrich and company, committed Americans have some                  strong advice for you: Leave the Constitution alone!  You and                   your colleagues are not bound by any oath to your "Contract."                   Each of you is bound by an oath to the Constitution which gives                 you all the authority you need to balance the federal budget.                   You have the power of the purse, and you have it because the                    Founders of this nation wanted it in the hands of the House,                    the congressional body the people can change every second year.                 If a majority of House members (218) really wants a balanced                    budget, it can be accomplished without tinkering with,                          discrediting, or doing further damage to the Constitution.                                                                                                      WHO IS TO BLAME?                                                                                                                                                Senators are as guilty as representatives of disregarding the                   Constitution.  Nor do we mean to disregard guilt on the part                    of the President and federal judges at every level.  Though their               oaths of office may differ slightly, all federal officials are                  required to swear allegiance to the U.S. Constitution.                                                                                                          Who is to blame for the ongoing travesty that is leading our nation             toward destruction?  Certainly all federal officials who discount               the Constitution and the solemn oath they take must receive                     abundant condemnation. But blame also lies with the American people             who allow their elected representatives to treat the Constitution               with contempt.                                                                                                                                                  Sound government under the U.S. Constitution will return only when              enough Americans are educated enough to demand that our nation's                leaders adhere uncompromisingly to the true "law of the land."                                                                                                  [end]                                                                       @START@Schindler's List...Spielberg's Slip!                                     [Excerpt]                                                                                                                                                       Of the highly acclaimed motion picture Schindler's List which tells the         story of the survivors, Helena Silber said that "the ending depicted [in        the film] at the Brinnlitz factory was, well, not quite right."  In a           March 18, 1994, article by Washington Times reporter Matt Neufeld, Helena       Silber tells the rest of the story:                                                                                                                             	The truth, she explains, was far more dramatic:  Toward                        	the end of the war, Oskar Schindler obtained guns for                          	his workers.  He wanted the Jews to be able to defend                          	themselves if the Nazis decided to slaughter them.                                                                                                             	The author of the book Schindler's List says Mrs. Silber's                     	account tallies with those of other survivors.  Thomas                         	Keneally says Schindler bribed the governor of the Moravian                    	province for the arms.  The workers then prepared for "a                       	pitched battle."                                                                                                                                               Mrs. Silber wonders why the film's ending wasn't entirely accurate:  "If        he [Spielberg]--had gotten me, I would have told him."                                                                                                          Movie Director Steven Spielberg's omission of this essential part of            history could not be because it was not known.  Thomas Keneally wrote of        the firearms acquisition in his book.  He reported:                                                                                                             	During the winter, Oskar [Schindler] built up an independent                   	arsenal...Most of the weapons, in any case, came from a                        	flawless source, from Obersturmbannfuher Rasch, SS and                         	police chief of Moravia.  The small cache included carbines                    	and automatic weapons, some pistols, some hand grenades...                                                                                                     	Once Oskar had the weapons, he appointed Uri Bejski, brother                   	of the rubber-stamp maker, keeper of the arsenal...                                                                                                            	Having selected a small body of prisoners for training, Uri                    	took one at a time into Salpeter's storehouse to teach                         	them the mechanisms of the Gewehr 41 W's [semi-automatic                       	military-style rifles].                                                                                                                                        In producing the movie, perhaps someone along the line felt that this           part of history was not "politically correct" given the force of today's        anti-gun sentiment--particularly in light of the popularized misconcep-         tion that semi-automatic firearms are "assault weapons" and unsuitable          for self-defense.                                                                                                                                               >From Mr. Keneally's account, there is no doubt that Jewish survivors of        the holocaust were fully prepared to defend themselves with just such           semi-automatic firearms.  No part of those historical atrocities should         be forgotten or rewritten or covered up for political reasons.

The decision has far reaching implications.                                                                                        Transportation Secretary Federico Pena had made headlines with his planned    recall of General Motors C/K pickup trucks because of an alleged safety         threat to drivers. Pena claimed that the location of the truck's "side-         saddle" gas tanks made the vehicle prone to catch fire if struck from the       side. He said that "approximately 150 people have died as a result of side-     impact fires in these trucks, in crashes that were otherwise survivable."       Pena added that "GM management ... appears to have made a decision favoring     sales over safety."                                                                                                                                               The recall was heralded by the Center for Auto Safety, a group founded by     consumer activist and auto-industry foe, Ralph Nader.  It referred to the GM    truck in question as a "rolling fireball" and had campaigned long and hard      for its recall. However, less than two months after his initial announcement,   the Transportation Secretary dropped his recall effort. In return, GM agreed    to pony up a cool $51 million to support auto safety research and buy 200,000   child safety seats for low-income families. By contrast, the recall would       have cost the giant automaker a fortune. Some 9 million C/K trucks were built   between 1973 and 1987.                                                                                                                                            In any event, why did Pena change his mind on the recall? The answer          reveals a classic example of regulatory excess. In announcing his recall        decision, the Transportation Secretary discarded a wealth of research data -    produced by his own agency - that showed the truck in question to be as safe    as any other on the road. In fact, the GM pickups had about the same fatality   rate from side-impact crashes as other similar trucks made by Chrysler and      Ford. And, it performed far better in side-impact crashes than did              the average passenger car built during the same period. In fact, the National   Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA - the agency within the         Transportation Department that handles auto safety issues - was about to        conclude an investigation showing that the trucks did not pose an "unreason-    able risk," and that they met all relevant safety standards when produced.      Marion Blakey, a former administrator at NHTSA, recently noted that "agency     engineers certified that the C/K pickups not only met but exceeded the          federal safety standard. Senior career officials unanimously recommended        that the investigation be closed."  Nonetheless, Pena went ahead with his       recall campaign. Writing in the Washington Post, Blakey called the Secre-       tary's decision "a troubling precedent." It set aside, he wrote, "an exhaus-    tive investigation by professional government researchers that had determined   the trucks met the federal safety standard." Worse, according to Blakey, the    decision appeared to apply an arbitrary safety standard for one type of         vehicle made by one auto manufacturer. "Instead of setting a clear bar for      manufacturers to jump over," he wrote, "it told car companies that in the       future they must jump and then the department would decide how high the         safety bar really was."  As the former highway safety official concluded:       "If American manufacturing cannot count on government to stand by its own       regulations, the result will be increased costs and damaged American            competitiveness abroad."                                                                                                                                          With any luck, the new Republican majority in Congress will make it a         priority to rein in these regulators, who make it their daily practice to       hound productive Americans, and who cost the economy hundreds of billions       of dollars. Although consumer activists and trial lawyers were unhappy,         Transportation Secretary Pena's decision to drop the recall campaign against    GM may be a sign that the Washington bureaucracy is already getting the         message from last November's congressional election.                                                                                                            --------------------------------------------------------------------------      Behind the Headlines, written by Philip C.

But all too often, the facts get lost in the             hustle.                                                                                                                                                           Recently, Science magazine published a report by two CalTech                  professors which suggested that the Earth's climate has been                    cooling and for the last 6,000 years. Global cooling? It's a                    possibility, says Time magazine. The news-weekly ran a cover                    article earlier this year with the title: "The Ice Age Cometh?"                                                                                                   But wait a minute. Wasn't it just a couple of years ago that the              supposed crisis was global warming? The polar caps would melt,                  the seas would rise and the world's coastal cities would be under               three or four feet of water?                                                                                                                                      What's the public to believe? Well, a report by Dan Murphy of                 Investor's Business Daily suggests that the public and policymakers             alike should cast a very skeptical eye on global climate claims.                Why? Because the real scientific community is only too willing to               admit that it doesn't have all the global climate answers. Consider             what one of the CalTech researchers told reporter Murphy. "This                 is such a new science," said Samuel Epstein, "and such a new thing              that we're in the process of developing it and finding out where                the possible inconsistencies might be." Epstein adds: "Something                that's as complicated as trying to read climate and various things,             it's foolish to say, `I have the answer.'"                                                                                                                        Epstein and other scientists are aware that the scientific record             is very incomplete. Epstein's work which shows a global cooling                 of about five degrees Celsius over the last 6,000 years, is based               on three-ring samples from the ancient bristlecone pine trees. And              this work builds on earlier bristlecone research. But other                     scientists have taken a different approach and tried to measure                 temperatures in a logical time series, especially over the 20th century.        And these findings suggest a slight warming trend since 1900 - about            one degree. Finally, a more recent study of global temperatures in the          atmosphere, collected by orbiting satellites since 1980, suggests               a very slight cooling trend - well within the range of normal                   variation.With such conflicting data, it's a small wonder that                  most scientists are uncertain. But the activists don't hesitate to              dismiss this scientific uncertainty. Indeed, they are engaging in               a breakneck effort to do something - anything! Consider how the                 information office of the United Nations' Office on Sustainable                 Development responded to the Investor's Business Daily article. A               new U.N. report, writes Julie Thompson of the information office,               "evaluates some of the uncertainties and fluctuations mentioned in              your article. But we admit that underlying the U.N.'s work is                   universal acceptance by Governments of the need to act today in                 order to avoid irreversible damage tomorrow." How's that again?                 The operative phrase in the U.N.'s explanation is: "universal                   acceptance by Governments of the need to act today...."                                                                                                           Now, "If the need to act" consisted of just funding additional                research until the scientific record was more complete, most                    Americans probably would agree. But the activists seem to have a                larger agenda in mind. Apparently, they want to control human                   activity and economic growth, and they're exploiting the global                 climate issue in the process. As the U.N.'s Julie Thompson notes:               "... the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change               reaffirm(s) its 1990 findings that global warming, primarily as                 a result of human activities, is a serious threat to the planet."                                                                                                 Most Americans would not stand for a directive by the U.N. to cut             back on driving or to modify electric utilities, forcing                        consumer rates ever higher. But that's essentially what is                      happening. The U.S. government appears to have "bought" the                     activists' idea of "Don't just stand there, do something," despite              the lack of clear scientific evidence. As one Washington wag put it:            "The activists never let the facts get in the way of a good cause."             ===================================================================             Behind the Headlines, written by Philip C.

At times the term seems to have taken       on an almost religious meaning, with the faithful assuming that "disposable"    is bad and "recycling" is good by definition.                                                                                                                   There's nothing wrong with recycling when it's approached from a perspective    of sound economics, good science, and voluntary cooperation.  Too often, it's   promoted as an end in itself without regard to whether it's worth the time      and expense.                                                                                                                                                    Recently, a speaker on this subject told my local Rotary Club that we should    all recycle more of the paper we use so America could save its trees.  The      implication was that we're using too much paper, that trees are endangered,     and that our civic duty requires that we do more with less.                                                                                                     As it turns out, most of the trees that are planted in America are planted      with the intent of eventually harvesting them to make things like paper.        This means that if we all used less paper, there would be fewer trees planted.  Maybe some people ought to use less paper anyway (bureaucrats, for instance),   but no one should assume that the people who are in the business of growing     and harvesting trees are going to continue to do so even if we don't buy        their products.                                                                                                                                                 "We're running out of trees" is a fiction older than most of the trees alive    today.  The truth is that though the total area of forestland in the conti-     nental United States is about the same as it was 75 years ago - 600 million     acres - there are far more trees because of greater tree density per acre.      Market-driven technological changes, such as the development of wood pre-       servatives, have led to more efficient use of forest resources.  Market         incentives have given private land owners good reason to replant nearly         three million acres of trees every year.  So when it comes to paper, recycle    to your heart's content, but not because you think we'll run out of trees       if you don't.                                                                                                                                                   A recycling mania has been sweeping the country for nearly a decade.  More      than 6,000 curbside programs are operated by local governments, serving at      least 70 million Americans.  In a recent year, more than 140 recycling laws     were passed in 38 states - mandating the activity or requiring taxpayers to     pay for it, or both.  All this has occurred at the same time that cost-cutting  entrepreneurs are busy producing less and less packaging to contain more and    more goods.                                                                                                                                                     Without any edicts from politicians, plastic milk jugs today contain 30         percent less plastic than they did just 20 years ago.  The weight of aluminum   cans declined by 36 percent between 1960 and 1990.  Experts like Lynn Scarlett  of the Los Angeles-based Reason Foundation point out that America's solid waste problem is a public policy failure, not a market failure.                                                                                                       Because of flat rate charges for municipal garbage pick-up and disposal,        government policies in most areas subsidize those who throw away large          quantities of refuse at the expense of those who throw away very little.        Entrepreneurs know how to construct landfills now that pose absolutely no       hazard to the environment, and anyone who has ever flown over almost any        state knows there's plenty of land for this purpose, but natsaying regulators   have almost closed down this efficient waste management option.                                                                                                 The fact is that sometimes recycling makes sense and sometimes it doesn't.      In the legislative rush to pass recycling mandates, state and local govern-     ments should pause to consider the science and the economics of every propo-    sition.  Often, bad ideas are worse than none at all and can produce lasting    damage if they are enshrined in law.  Simply demanding that something be        recycled can be disruptive of markets and it does not guarantee that recycling  that makes either economic or environmental sense will even occur.                                                                                              Many people believe that simply segregating plastic containers, glass bottles,  newspapers, and metal cans and then placing them in colorful boxes at curbside  means that recycling has somehow taken place.  Without ever questioning either  the cost or the outcome of the process that starts at the curb, they assume     that whatever happens must be both economically and environmentally sound.                                                                                      Recycling, however, doesn't really happen unless all that plastic, glass,       paper, and metal is turned into new, useful products that are actually in       demand in the marketplace.  Some of what we put at curbside actually ends up    in a landfill or piled to the ceiling in warehouses with no place to go.        Recycling programs may make a lot of civic-minded citizens feel good, but the   whole rationale is undermined to the extent they are nothing more than          expensive, politically motivated, and circuitous methods of old-fashioned       garbage disposal.                                                                                                                                               Quite often, more energy and resources are spent than saved in the process of   recycling.  Municipal governments, because of the inherent shortcomings of      public sector accounting and budget information, routinely underestimate the    full costs of their recycling programs.                                                                                                                         One area where recycling plainly works is in the disposal of aluminum cans.     Since the process requires 10 percent less energy than transforming bauxite     into aluminum, it pays for producers to use recycled cans.  Hence, a market     has developed for these cans, and market incentives encourage entrepreneurs     to find efficient ways to collect them.                                                                                                                         One area where recycling doesn't make sense is in the disposal of juice         containers used principally by school children.  Aseptic disposable packages    such as those small juice boxes were banned in Maine and are a target of the    more extreme environmentalists.  But as a 1991 study from the National Center   for Policy Analysis (NCPA) in Dallas showed, such knee-jerk, interventionist,   pseudo-solutions to nonproblems are rooted in misinformation or incomplete      information:                                                                                                                                                    * Filling disposable boxes requires about half as much energy as filling the    supposedly preferable alternative, glass bottles.                                                                                                               * For a given beverage volume, transporting empty glass bottles requires 15     times as many trucks as the empty boxes - thus using more fuel and causing      more air pollution.                                                                                                                                             * Because the end product is lightweight, small, and rectangular, the boxes     can be transported more efficiently than full glass bottles - using 35 per-     cent less energy.                                                                                                                                               Some staes have threatened to ban disposable diapers as a way to encourage the  use (and recycling) of cloth diapers.  Studies show, however, that when all     environmental effects are considered, cloth has no clear advantage over dis-    posables.  In California and other western states where there is relatively     abundant landfill space and a shortage of water, the case for disposables is    actually quite strong.  Residents of those states who avoid them and wash cloth diapers with the scarce water may actually be doing harm to the environment.    The marketplace, once again, is not as dumb as certain do-gooders think it is.                                                                                  Several cities, including Portland, Oregon, and Newark, New Jersey, have        essentially banned polystyrene food packages.  That's what McDonald's used      to put its burgers in until it was pressured into switching to paperboard       containers.  The average American thinks these efforts are positive for the     environment because they will somehow promote recycling.  They also believe     that because paper is "biodegradable" and polystyrene is not, the switch will   reduce the need for landfills.  The truth of the matter is more complicated     than that.                                                                                                                                                      Polystyrene, it so happens, is completely recyclable, which isn't always true   of the paper used in, say, drinking cups.  And those paper cups, by the way,    cost the consumer about 2 1/2 times as much as polystyrene.                                                                                                     Studies from NCPA and other respected organizations show that production of     the old polystyrene McDonald's hamburger shell actually used 30 percent less    energy than paperboard and resulted in 46 percent less air pollution and 42     percent less water pollution.  The average 10-gram paper cup consumes 33 grams  of wood and uses 28 percent more petroleum in its manufacture than the entire   input of a polystyrene cup.                                                                                                                                     Furthermore, the paper cup requires 36 times more chemical input (partly        because it weighs seven times as much) and takes about twelve times as much     steam, 36 times as much electricity and twice as much cooling water to make,    compared to its polystyrene counterpart.  And, about 580 times as much waste    water, 10 to 100 times the residual effluents of pollutants, and three times    the air emission pollutants are produced in making the paper cup.                                                                                               Environmentalists who put their faith in government, with hardly a scrap of     evidence that suggests they should, seem oblivious to these realities.  To      them, mountains of refuse waiting to be recycled into things people don't       want at a cost they would never freely pay is not a reason to abolish manda-    tory recycling schemes.  Instead, it gives them a reason to pass new laws       that would force-feed the economy with recycled products.                                                                                                       Market economists - by nature, philosophy, and experience - are skeptical of    schemes to supplant the free choices of consumers with the dictates of central  planners.  the recycling mania confirms their suspicions.

Place the '$DYNAMIC metacommand at the top of        your program.  Using DIM Array(Constant,constant) places the entire             thing in DGroup -> the 64K chunk of memory reserved for the stack and           static variables.  Using REDIM places it in far memory -> all memory            left after the .EXE code and the 64K taken by DGroup.                           @START@ProBas ToolKit                                                                                 ProBas ToolKit                                                                                                                            Overview                                                                                                                                                        The ProBas ToolKit is a collection of high-level modules that                   make extensive use of the low-level routines in the ProBas                      Professional Basic Programming Library. The philosophy behind                   ProBas is to provide powerful, proven, low-level routines that                  afford the most capability with the least encumbrance. The                      ProBas ToolKit compliments this idea by providing high-level,                   "plug-in" modules so that you concentrate on the task at hand,                  not on spending hours or days writing and debugging another menu                or some commonly-used module.                                                                                                                                   The bottom line is simple: Time is money and you have better                    things to do than recreate the wheel. When you get right down to                it, a single ToolKit routine can save weeks of coding time. When                you consider how much your time is worth, just that one routine                 can more than pay for your entire collection of tools.

These                modules can be stored in a library for easy access or loaded via                the File menu in the QB/QBX editor. Users of Microsoft's                        Professional Development System Basic 7 can load ProBas ToolKit                 modules into EMS memory to leave more programming room in the                   QBX environment.                                                                                                                                                Using ToolKit modules couldn't be easier; just set a few                        variables and CALL the module. The calling parameters are                       logical, consistent, and follow the ProBas philosophy of maximum                flexibility with minimal limitations.

All modules were designed to afford maximum power and                           flexibility.                                                                                                                                                    The ToolKit features menuing modules to suit almost every need.                 Choose from a wide selection of pull-down, pop-up, 123, bar,                    highlight and scroll menus, with and without mouse support and                  with and without help reminder lines.                                                                                                                           Other products offer only a limited number of 25x80 text mode                   menus. The dozens of menus in the ToolKit support 25, 43 or                     50-line text modes, CGA graphics modes 1 and 2, EGA graphics                    modes 7, 8 and 9, VGA graphics modes 11 and 12 and the Super VGA                800x600 mode that Basic doesn't directly support, not to                        mention our exclusive text and graphic mode virtual screens.                                                                                                    The ToolKit gives you complete control over all aspects of each                 menu, including overall placement, the text and placement of                    menu items, colors, and even the type interface.  Each menu                     comes with fully commented and documented Basic source code so                  that you can easily modify or add features to any menu module.                  For example, you can have a pull-down menu item invoke a pop-up                 menu, and return to the pull-down, just by inserting a few lines                of code.                                                                                                                                                        SAA-compliant pull-down menus and dialog boxes are very popular                 these days. ToolKit's text and graphic mode pull-down menus have                all of the features you expect, such as the alt-key illuminating                the bar, hotkeys, invalid menu items, stand-alone bar items,                    check boxes, radio buttons, reminder lines and simultaneous                     support for both the point-and-shoot and press-drag-release                     mouse interfaces.                                                                                                                                               When working with pull-down menus and dialog boxes, you can                     choose self-contained modules that you call and which return                    when the user is done, or you can build your own using the                      interactive menu and dialog objects that give you complete                      control over every aspect of the interface.                                                                                                                     Dialog objects include input boxes with full text editing and                   masking, text lines, check boxes, radio buttons, vertical and                   horizontal list boxes and more. There are even pre-configured                   plug-in dialog objects, such as a QuickBASIC-style file                         selection box. All of these modules are written in Basic using                  the assembly routines in ProBas, so you can easily incorporate                  additional features to suit your exact needs by simply calling                  other ProBas routines or ToolKit Modules.                                                                                                                       The graphics menus, dialog boxes and list boxes make extensive                  use of the graphic icons and GUI objects in the ProBas library.                 This allows you to define your own GUI standards or emulate the                 look and feel of Microsoft Windows to any degree. You can even                  grab dialog objects, such as vertical or horizontal scroll                      boxes, and incorporate them into your program any way you like                  for Windows' functionality without the Windows look.                                                                                                            Windows Galore                                                                                                                                                  With ProBas and the ToolKit you get windowing capabilities that                 put dedicated window libraries to shame. You can give your                      programs that professional snap with the powerful and flexible                  windowing modules in the ToolKit.                                                                                                                               Need to ask the user to select from a list? Put the list in a                   scrolling window with a highlight bar, with or without scroll                   bars, and with or without mouse support. How about allowing the                 user to tag multiple items? No problem! Why just scroll a file                  when you can present it in a window with full vertical and                      horizontal scrolling with just a single call? Why prompt a user                 for a file name when you can display a directory in a window                    (with any combination of name, size, date, time and attribute                   information) and allow the user to select a file using the                      keyboard or the mouse? It's easy!                                                                                                                               Pop-Up Tools                                                                                                                                                    The ToolKit contains a selection of high-level plug-in pop-up                   tools. Need an editor? Pop-up either a mini-editor with                         word-wrap for short memos and notes or a more extensive word                    processor for bigger editing jobs. You have complete control                    over size, placement and colors. Want to add a combination                      single/multi-user rolodex and mailing-list data base with full                  B-Tree indexing?  No problem. How about a multi-user notepad                    database? It's in there. Other handy pop-up tools include a                     pop-up dual-memory, multi-mode calculator, modules that allow                   your users to select program colors and much more.                                                                                                              B-Tree Indexing                                                                                                                                                 The ToolKit comes with a complete multi-user B-Tree indexing                    system that allows you to create, find, add, edit and insert                    keys in a balanced B-Tree index. Written entirely in assembly                   language, these routines are blindingly fast and take up hardly                 any memory at all. For example, an index of 10 million last                     names requires less that 16K of memory in your program and can                  locate a record in under a second!                                                                                                                              Routines include insert, delete, full and partial searches, get                 next key, get previous key, get first key and get last key. Open                as many indexes as you need to search on multiple keys. Use                     indexes to instantly sort megabytes of data. Use the B-Tree                     routines with the lightning-fast file I/O routines in ProBas to                 assess and manipulate huge data bases thousands of times faster                 than possible with Basic alone. Key and record limits are in the                billions, so you'll never outgrow these routines.                                                                                                               Calendar & Date Routines                                                                                                                                        The ToolKit comes with colorful pop-up calendar modules with all                of the features that you expect. These great-looking calendars                  will appear fully drawn in the blink of an eye in either text                   mode or EGA/VGA graphic modes for a really impressive look. You                 get modules that pop-up a calendar, interactive routines that                   allow the user to browse through months and years, and calendar                 modules that allow you to define the keystrokes and user                        interface.                                                                                                                                                      The ToolKit's Julian date routines are a must when working with                 date-driven applications like accounts-receivable or inventory                  control. You can easily find out the number of elapsed days                     between two dates, what the date was 37 days ago, or what it                    will be in 90 days. Other handy date routines include a routine                 to tell you what day of the week a particular date falls on,                    anytime in the current, previous or next century.                                                                                                               Assembly Answers To Basic Problems                                                                                                                              Lest you get the wrong impression, not all of the routines in                   the ToolKit are written in Basic. While Basic modules that make                 extensive use of the assembly routines from the ProBas library                  are the best way to handle many programming chores, some things                 just work better in assembly. So, in addition to the assembly                   B-Tree routines, the ToolKit also includes a selection of                       high-level assembly subsystems to perform tasks that would be                   impossible with Basic.                                                                                                                                          Patch EXEs                                                                                                                                                      The ToolKit's PATCH routines allow you to patch .EXE files and                  create self-modifying code. This is an ideal way to create                      installation programs that do away with configuration files that                can  be lost or damaged. You can use these tools to easily patch                filespecs, passwords, and other user-defined data right into                    your executable program. For example, you can embed the user's                  name and company name into the program files in an encrypted                    format, so that their name appears every time the program is run                to discourage pirating. You can also use these routines to add                  serial numbers to your programs during disk duplication, patch                  data for custom menus created by the user or even write programs                that learn with use and modify themselves.                                                                                                                      BCD Math Routines                                                                                                                                               The ToolKit comes with a set of BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)                      routines that allow you to work with numbers as large as 255                    digits with any number of digits to the left or right of the                    decimal point. These routines are string-based and amazingly                    fast and include functions such as add, subtract, multiply,                     divide, compare, sine, cosine, tangent, and more plus routines                  for formatting numbers to words and rounding BCD values.                                                                                                        TSR Protected Storage                                                                                                                                           The ToolKit includes a full set of routines to create a TSR                     (terminate and stay resident) protected storage area in memory.                 This allows your program to set aside anywhere from 1K to 63K of                memory as a TSR storage area into which you can "peek" and                      "poke" entire strings or arrays at assembly language speed.                                                                                                     You can use a protected storage area to pass data between                       chained, shelled or stand-alone programs, or to permit the                      program to exit entirely and come back with your data still                     intact. The TSR routines can also be a viable alternative for                   protected data storage when your customers don't have EMS or XMS                memory.                                                                                                                                                         CGA Character Sets                                                                                                                                              Tired of the limited character set available in CGA? With the                   ToolKit, you can create custom character sets for CGA that are                  just the thing for making laptop and briefcase computer screens                 easier to read.                                                                                                                                                 These routines allow you to add or redefine the IBM-extended                    character set or add up to 128 additional custom characters,                    icons, logos, and foreign characters at a time. Best of all,                    these character sets just take up 2K of memory.                                                                                                                 Other Goodies                                                                                                                                                   The ToolKit comes with all of this plus a comprehensive manual                  consisting of Introduction, Tutorial and Reference sections,                    detailed examples, and fully commented Basic source code. Many                  of our customers tell us that the ToolKit not only saved them                   hundreds of programming hours, but also taught them hundreds of                 programming tricks and how to get the most out of Basic. The                    ProBas ToolKit is the ideal companion for the ProBas Library.

After a quick        refresher course on the basics that were well covered in the first volume,      MORE INTERNET FOR DUMMIES expands on several topics and covers new areas        to give the moderately experienced user new skills and knowledge on             advanced Inter-netting.                                                                                                                                         To be sure, there's a certain amount of duplication, but I found enough new     material to make this volume worthwhile in its own right.  Authors Levine       and Young provide detailed coverage of some of the commercial on-line           services that offer Internet access such as Delphi and America Online as        well as public UNIX providers.  There's a chapter on using Windows software     to cruise the Internet as well as chapters on Trumpet (a great newsreader)      and Eudora (an easy-to-use mail reading pgm available for both Windows and      Mac users).  MORE INTERNET FOR DUMMIES even tells you how to grab your own      copy of the shareware version of Eudora right off the net!                                                                                                      Other subjects expanded from INTERNET FOR DUMMIES include HGopher, WINWAIS,     Internet Relay Chat or IRC for short, as well as updated and detailed           World Wide Web coverage as well.  There are a lot of little tidbits, called     "Fun and Silly Stuff" and "10,000 Interesting Things to Do on the Net"          to keep you busy for days.  Finally there's a pretty comprehensive glossary     that will intrepret the buzzwords and jargon and translate it to plain,         understandable English.                                                                                                                                         MORE INTERNET FOR DUMMIES is a post-graduate course on mastering the Internet   and would be of particular interest to anyone using Windows and the programs    that run under it to access the Net.  It is well written with humor and         includes more Rich Tennant's 5th Wave cartoons which are delightful as          always.  Not only is it enjoyable reading, you'll learn something too!                                                                                          %T      More Internet for Dummies                                               %A      John R Levine & Margaret Levine Young                                   %I      IDG Books Worldwide                                                     %C      San Mateo  California                                                   %D      1994                                                                    %O      $19.95 USA  $26.95 Canada                                               %G      ISBN:1-56884-164-7                                                      %P      390 pages, paperbound                                                   %K      Internet, computer netwoeks, online services                                                                                                            (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

Given the sophisticated state-of-    the-art in receivers and transcievers, it seems that the only area left for     experimentation and practical construction projects is the antenna system.                                                                                      Andrew Yoder (author of PIRATE RADIO, also published by TAB/McGraw-Hill)        gives us lots of good hands-on information for the beginner and veteran         alike.  In the brief introduction, Yoder gives us some shortwave basics,        discusses propagation and even chides the F.C.C. by reprinting a news release   written by them in which they display an incredibly erroneous description of    radio propagation.                                                                                                                                              The serious portion of the book begins with beginner and makeshift antennas     and continues with basic discussions on horizontal, vertical antennas and       transmission lines.  Now equipped with some fundamental knowledge we can        start to construct some antennas.  Author Yoder gives some essential info       on construction, tools, materials and practices, masts and supports and,        most important, emphasizes safety measures, grounding and lightning             protection - probably the most important considerations when discussing         antennas.                                                                                                                                                       Also covered are the standard half-wave dipole, end-fed Zepp, loops, rhombics,  inverted vees and highly directional antennas.  In addition, for those with     limited space, there is a chapter on indoor, limited space and portable         antenna systems that perform quite well given the limitations.  Finally,        there's a discussion on radio interference.  The appendices include a chart     of wire lengths for half-wave antennas, a bibliography and a list of            suppliers.                                                                                                                                                      I enjoyed reading Andy Yoder's BUILD YOUR OWN SHORTWAVE ANTENNAS and would      definitely recommend it as a valuable addition to any radio enthusiasts         bookshelf.                                                                                                                                                      %T      Shortwave Antennas                                                      %A      Andrew Yoder                                                            %I      TAB/McGraw-Hill                                                         %C      New York Ney York                                                       %D      1994                                                                    %O      $16.95                                                                  %G      ISBN: 0-07-076534-0                                                     %P      207 pages, paperbound                                                   %K      shortwave radio reception, antennas                                                                                                                     (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

The colorful cover reminds me of the supermarket        checkout tabloids that I never seem to be able to avoid no matter how           hard I try.                                                                                                                                                     INTERNET INSIDER offers such revelations as "Boy's Soul Sucked Into FAX-        MODEM!", "Man Buys Desert Town - Plans to Build Info Highway" and "The          King is Alive and Well Online - Sources say He Prefers Macs!"  Of course        there's the obligatory O.J. Simpson drivel, complete with your own O.J.         police mugshot and photo of his cell in the "VIP Wing" of the L.A. County       lockup.  To be fair, there are some serious articles as well, such as "Is       Big Brother Reading Your E-mail?" dated 1990.                                                                                                                   Many of the inclusions in INTERNET INSIDER are taken from various offbeat       newsgroups or contributed by net users.  And, there's more - the author         promises to provide an ongoing e-mail updates and accept contributions          for a future edition which will also be available by anonymous FTP.                                                                                             I found the INTERNET INSIDER marginally amusing.  However, I wonder what        the reaction might be if one of our new Congress members opposed to spending    any more taxpayer money on the NREN got hold of a copy and used it to show      the results of that funding!  Personally I'll stick to MAD and old copies       of NATIONAL LAMPOON.  However, if you're a fan of the Midnight Star and         other supermarket tabloids you'll love INTERNET INSIDER.                                                                                                        %T      Internet Insider - The Shocking News from the Edge of Cyberspace        %A      Ruffin Prevost                                                          %I      Osborne McGraw-Hill                                                     %C      Berkeley California                                                     %D      1995                                                                    %O      $14.95                                                                  %G      ISBN: 0-07-882084-7                                                     %P      284 pp paperbound                                                       %K      Internet humor                                                                                                                                          (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

However, the change from single to        multiengine flight presents new situations and elements of danger and it        is essential for anyone seeking to make the transition be aware of these.                                                                                       Paul Craig, a CFI (Certified Flight Instructor) covers the essential            subjects: multiengine aerodynamics, takeoffs, landings, engine-out              procedures, propeller systems, fuel and electrical systems.  Also included      is a description of multiengine flight training detailing a syllabus of         seven lessons complete with objectives and completion standards.  Next,         author Craig tells us about the Multiengine rating practical test standards     and what to expect including sample oral questions you are likely to be asked   during the examination.  Finally, there is a chapter on the multiengine         flight instructor and what to do once you earn your multiengine rating.                                                                                         This book is obviously not for new pilots, but for those with many single       engine hours in their log books and considerable flight experience.  A          multiengine rating is mandatory for those seeking the Commercial Pilot's        license or those wishing to move up to larger, faster and more powerful         aircraft.  This book will help you understand what you're getting into          and help you through it should you decide to go after your multiengine          rating.                                                                                                                                                         %T      Multiengine Flying                                                      %A      Paul A Craig                                                            %I      TAB/McGraw-Hill                                                         %C      Blue Ridge Summit, PA                                                   %D      1994                                                                    %O      $19.95                                                                  %G      ISBN:0-07-013423-5                                                      %P      212 pp, paperbound                                                      %K      aviation, multiengine                                                                                                                                   (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO MULTIMEDIA    seems to take up where the first book leaves off in expanding and offering      new material on the subject.                                                                                                                                    Some of the subjects covered include the Top Ten Things You Need to Know        About Multimedia, Graphics and Sound, MIDI, WAV, installing and trouble-        shooting multimedia peripherals, hardware and software.  Also covered are       the Top Ten CD-ROMs including Encarta, MYST and eight more.                                                                                                     Of particular interest is a complete section on how to make your own            multimedia presentations using text, images and sound to make all kinds of      innovative and creative productions - slide shows, cartoons, animations and     even movies!                                                                                                                                                    The book comes with a bonus CD-ROM that contains some neat stuff to play        with - such as several game demos such as Epic's Pinball, Overkill (a           fast space arcade game) and DOOM which is one of the hottest PC games ever!

The CD-ROM contains 180 MB         of games that should keep any moderately active gamer occupied for months.                                                                                      System requirements are a 386 processor, 4 megs of RAM, a hard drive and,       of course, a CD-ROM drive.  In addition, many of the games support a mouse,     joystick and soundcard.  But, of course, any serious game-player has all        that and probably much better.                                                                                                                                  There are text adventures, dungeons, Pac-mazes, tetroids, puzzles, packing,     strategy and 3-D games galore, including Castle Wolfenstein (with several       add-ons), Commander Keen, Doom and a whole lot more.                                                                                                            Also included is the Adventure Game Toolkit from Softworks.  This is regarded   as the best adventure game engine available anywhere and allows you to write    your own adventure game.                                                                                                                                        All in all, FATAL DISTRACTIONS is a wonderful collection of games and great     diversions and $27.00 is a pretty good deal for the serious (and not so         serious game player.                                                                                                                                            %T      Fatal Distractions                                                      %A      David Gerrold                                                           %I      The Waite Group Press                                                   %C      Corte Madera California                                                 %D      1994                                                                    %O      Includes CD-ROM $26.95                                                  %G      ISBN: 1-878739-77-8                                                     %P      173 pages paperbound                                                    %K      computer games                                                                                                                                          (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

This book       will guide you into this fascinating world that has been compared by            many to Citizens' Band (CB) Radio, mainly for its similarities in engaging      in communiations with total strangers on a random basis.                                                                                                        INTERNET CHAT QUICK TOUR will tell you what to do in order to get connected     to IRC and how to communicate within this multi-channel medium, showing         which of these channels are fun, wierd and informative and how to participate   in them.  Also covered are rules of etiquette, behavioral quirks and patterns   you're likely to encounter and some warnings as well.                                                                                                           There is pretty decent coverage of the various chat channels on a multitude     of subjects which explains what kind of discussion you may expect to find       on them and information on IRC-related World Wide Web pages.  The appendices    list many IRC servers, contain a glossary of terminology and an explaination    of the free On-line Companion service offered by Ventana Press.                                                                                                 Although I am not personally familiar with IRC and on-line chatting, the        book seems to explain the basics quite satisfactorily and thoroughty            enough to satisfy anyone interested in becoming active on this interesting      new communication medium.  Donald Rose's book managed to pique my interest      to the point that I may give it a try, when I have a few hours to kill.                                                                                         %T      Internet Chat Quick Tour                                                %A      Donald Rose                                                             %I      Ventana Press                                                           %C      Chapel Hill NC                                                          %D      1995                                                                    %O      $14.00                                                                  %G      ISBN: 1-56604-223-2                                                     %P      174 pp, paperbound                                                      %K      Internet, IRC, on-line chat                                                                                                                             (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

The subject is fascinating because it is      so new that, in many cases, there are no legal precedents to guide us and       therefore, its like sailing in uncharted waters.                                                                                                                If there is such a person who is a recognized authority on the subject          of online law it would have to be Lance Rose, Esq.  He writes regularly         for WIRED and BOARDWATCH and is a moderator on LEXIS Counsel Connect, a         high-priced online system for attorneys.  His law firm specializes in           online legal matters.  He is definitely very well qualified to author such      a book.                                                                                                                                                         NETLAW covers many important issues - everything from freedom of speech,        censorship, contracts, copyright, privacy, the public domain and a whole        lot more.  There's a chapter on dangers and responsibilities in the online      world as well as online crime and what to do when the cops come knocking        on your door with examples of prominent search and seizure cases like           the Steve Jackson Games case.  Also covered are adult materials, obscenity      and pornography.                                                                                                                                                The appendices contain a lot of valuable goodies as well - sample contracts,    the text of relevant legislation such as the Electronic Communications          Provacy Act, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, New York's Computer Crime        Statute, the Child pornography Statute, relevant cases with citations,          a bibliography of sources of additional information and much more.                                                                                              America is, unfortunately, a lithigator's paradise - make a wrong move and      someone's waiting to sue you.  This book is not a substitute for competent      legal advice, but it may just save you from putting yourself in an awkward      and compromising position that could cost you big bucks and more.  NETLAW is    not an easy read, but author Rose has done a fine job with the difficult task   of writing about the Law for laypeople in language they can understand.         It is therefore a valuable work and and every serious net user would be         well advised to read it.                                                                                                                                        %T      Netlaw - Your Rights in the Online World                                %A      Lance Rose, Esq                                                         %I      Osborne/McGraw-Hill                                                     %C      Berkeley California                                                     %D      1995                                                                    %O      $19.95                                                                  %G      ISBN: 0-07-882077-4                                                     %P      372 pp, paperbound                                                      %K      Internet, computer networks, legal issues                                                                                                               (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

These reviews seem to have been     somewhat superficial so by way of balance here are my opinions.                                                                                                 Good Points                                                                     -----------                                                                                                                                                     The interface works well.  The first screen contains lots of objects that you   can point and click at.  These range from a pair of sunglasses (aviators ?) to  cards marked 'Highest Mountain', 'Largest Lake' etc.  The latter are spoiled    because some of the titles are illegible.  Every screen including this one has  a rolled up embroidered scroll at the bottom.  Click on this and it unrolls to  give a series of navigation options.  This clever idea means that the screens   are never cluttered by a menu, and when you do want the menu a common set of    icons help you navigate.  As you navigate through the atlas a selection of      world music plays.                                                                                                                                              Clicking on the sunglasses brings up a beautifully rendered satellite picture ofthe earth complete with surface and submarine topography.  Clicking on four     directional arrows causes this image to rotate.  Zooming in to the image        displays increasingly more detail.                                                                                                                              Unfortunately you can't zoom from the satellite image to the actual world maps. Surely this would not have been too difficult to code ?  You can look at        political or geographic maps of the world and zoom in to a particular country.  You can click on some of the larger cities to get a couple of facts and figures about them.                                                                                                                                                     Using the menu bar you can get a brief socio-political history of each country. You can also choose to look at a gallery of photographs of that country whilst  listening to a selection of local music.  Once you have selected a country you  can return to the first screen to find out about the largest, highest etc. in   that country.                                                                                                                                                   The title screen also allows you to use a crude text search facility to find    the text on a particular country, city, lake etc.                                                                                                               Bad Points                                                                      ----------                                                                                                                                                      And that's all .....                                                                                                                                            The geographical maps have a very poor level of detail.  Only the major         metropolitan areas and geographical features are displayed.  This means that    you will not be able to find small cities or large towns.  I want to be able to use a CD atlas to find the location of any large town in the world.  Ideally I  would like to be taken to the appropriate part of the atlas as well.                                                                                            One of the major selling point of multimedia educational tools is depth of      information.  By any measure of depth this title fails.  To only store          facts about the country as a whole plus the record holding cities, lakes and    mountains is pathetic.  I want to be able find out information about particular cities, and perhaps even see their sights and sounds.  Some of the better US    atlases allow the user to zoom down to street maps.  Why not hold a street map  for each capital city ?                                                                                                                                         This is a contentious area, but I expect the socio-political coverage to be     un-biased.  The section on the UK is very biased and does not represent a true  account of the political happenings of the last decade.  The picture gallery forthe UK begins with a series of pictures of 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland.  Despite perceptions in the US, this does not shape the day to day lives of the  majority of the population of Northern Ireland let alone the rest of the UK.                                                                                    If this title is being bought as a research tool then you will be sadly         disappointed.  There is no image or text capture facility.  So you will not be  able to copy information to your favourite word processor to turn into an       essay for school.  In my opinion there is insufficient depth of information to  perform any real research.                                                                                                                                      Conclusion                                                                      ----------                                                                                                                                                      Why would anyone want to own this title ?                                                                                                                       If you want a pretty satellite image of the earth and want to browse the        sights and sounds of particular countries whilst astounding people with facts   like 'The second biggest city in Tibet is ...' then this title is for you.                                                                                      If you want any more detail below the level of country then look at what other  atlases are available.  This CD has a very slick front end and enough           information to convice the average reviewer, but it has NO DEPTH.  The majority of people will get bored of it very quickly.                                                                                                                    If you own Encarta '95 (Sorry, I can't speak for the other encyclopedias) then  DO NOT BUY this CD.  Encarta contains more geographical information than this   disk and allows you to see the sights and sounds of individual cities not just  countries.  Ok, Encarta's map is cruder but then it's not supposed to be an     atlas.                                                                                                                                                          If you want an atlas with pretty pictures of the world and good detailed        country maps, then consider spending half the price of the disk on a paper atlasand the rest on a good CD game.

To run Expert Software's TRAVEL PLANNER CD you'll need a 486SX or higher        computer with 4MB of RAM, 5MB of hard drive space, MicroSoft Windows 3.1,       VGA/SVGA, a mouse, a MPC2 compatible CD-ROM drive and as an option, a           sound card.                                                                                                                                                     Quite frankly I'm impressed with this package, mainly in that it offers         plenty of bang for the buck - lots of great features many of which are          missing from the higher priced travel planners.  At $19.95 it should please     just about everyone.                                                                                                                                            %T      Travel Planner CD                                                       %I      Expert Software                                                         %C      Coral Gables FL                                                         %D      1994                                                                    %O      CD-ROM, $19.95                                                          %K      Travel planner, roadmaps                                                                                                                                (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

One reviewer said "this is          the CD-ROM that will make print encyclopedias obsolete", but its really         like comparing apples and oranges.  ENCARTA'95 is a LOT more fun than           a shelf full of books!                                                                                                                                          ENCARTA'95 is a sight and sound show that teaches.  It contains more than       26,000 articles, 7,000 photos and illustrations, 800 maps, over 100             animations and video clips and, if that's not enough, more than 8 hours of      sound!  Microsoft's team of 25 editors update ENCARTA annually - the 1995       edition contains more than 10,000 revised articles and plenty of new material   as well.                                                                                                                                                        The ENCARTA powerful pinpoint tool finds information easily and allows users    to search by title, time, media, place, or key words and filters information    to browse, create lists and find facts quickly and effortlessly.  The new       fly-out menus make finding articles much easier and faster.  ENCARTA is         extremely easy to master by anyone who can point a mouse and click the          buttons!                                                                                                                                                        System requirements are pretty standard - a 386SX, 4MB of RAM, 3.5MB of         free hard drive space, CD-ROM drive, sound card, SVGA monitor, Windows 3.1      or later, a mouse and loudspeakers.                                                                                                                             ENCARTA also features an interactive world atlas, an illustrated timeline       of world history, a media gallery with thousands of graphics and a neat         learning game called MindMaze.                                                                                                                                  One feature I find extremely useful is ENCARTA'95's seamless integration        with Microsoft's BOOKSHELF and WORKS programs which allows users to import      information directly into a word processing application for easier report       writing.  I sure wish I had that capability when I was writing term papers      and essays.   Unfortunately, my review does not do ENCARTA'95 justice!          There's so much great stuff and innovative presentation here.  You really       have to play with ENCARTA'95 for a few hours to fully appreciate it.  If you    recently purchased a multimedia system you may find that ENCARTA'95 was         bundled with the software that came with it.  If not, buy it and if you're      not pleased, Microsoft offers you a 90 day money-back guarantee.  You can't     lose!                                                                                                                                                           %T      Encarta'95                                                              %I      Microsoft                                                               %D      1994                                                                    %O      CD-ROM, $99.95                                                          %K      encyclopedia                                                                                                                                            (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

It offers the        equivilent of 132 separate dictionaries or language combinations and 7          million words on a single CD-ROM.  Amazing!                                                                                                                     The database contains specialized words from business, science and              technology as well as everyday terms.  It will easily and quickly provide       translations, definitions and synonyms.  As a bonus, LANGUAGES OF THE           WORLD contains N T C's American Idioms Dictionary.                                                                                                              N T C Publishing group produces high-quality travel guides and many language    courses, so the LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD CD-ROM is no surprise.  It comes in      three formats: MS-DOS, Windows and Macintosh.  The MS-DOS version search        engine can be used as a TSR with a word processor, thus allowing you to         paste the result of your dictionary search directly into the document being     edited.  The Windows version the same feature and can be inserted into any      Windows application through the use of the clipboard.  In addition, the         Windows version offers the option of displaying Japanese and Chinese            characters on the screen.

LANGUAGES OF THE          WORLD is not difficult to master using the HELP and pop-up definitions and      examples.  I found this CD to be quite handy in going back and forth between    the various world's major languages, but I am puzzled by the fact that          Russian, which is spoken by over 200 million speakers, was omitted.                                                                                                                                                                             %T      Languages of the World                                                  %I      N T C Publishing Group                                                  %C      4255 Touhy Ave Lincolnwood Illinois 60646                               %O      CD-ROM  DOS $129.95 Windows $149.95                                     %G      ISBN: DOS 0-8442-9294-X  WINDOWS 0-8442-9250-8                          %K      disctinaries                                                                                                                                            (C) 1995                                                                        Michael Crestohl                                                                Nahant Massachusetts  USA                                                       mc@shore.net                                                                                                                                                    DISCLAIMER:  I have no interest, financial or otherwise, in the success or      failure of the book or materials reviewed herewith, nor have I received any     compensation (other than a review copy requested by me) from anyone who has.

Recent Launches                                                                 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                The newly formed Lockheed Martin carried out its first launch                   on Mar 22; the former General Dynamics Commercial Launch Services,              which had become Martin Marietta CLS, is now part of the new                    Lockheed Martin empire, and the San Diego (old GD/Convair Space Systems         Division) and Denver (old Martin Marietta Astronautics Titan plant)             operations are to be merged.                                                                                                                                    Lockheed Martin's Atlas IIAS launch vehicle flight AC-115 (Atlas stage          number 8204) took off from LC36B at Cape Canaveral and placed a Space           Systems/Loral FS-1300 class communications satellite in orbit for               INTELSAT, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization.          Intelsat 705 will be placed over the Atlantic Ocean.                                                                                                            The AC-115 launch was swiftly followed by the final Atlas E launch from         Vandenberg on Mar 24, and a further Atlas Centaur launch, this time a           IIA model, from pad 36A at Canaveral on Apr 7. AC-114 (with Atlas first         stage 8111) placed  American Mobile Satellite Corp.'s AMSC-1 into orbit.        AMSC-1 (also known as M-SAT) is a Hughes HS-601 class comsat with 16            L-band and one Ku-band transponders. The satellite is the first to be           optimized for mobile telephone communications. It will be complemented          by a similar M-SAT satellite for Canada's Telesat Mobile Inc., to be            launched later this year.                                                                                                                                       Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Pegasus launch vehicle returned to flight on           Apr 3. This was the first successful launch using the Lockheed L-1011           carrier airplane, which took off from Vandenberg AFB and dropped the            Pegasus over the Point Arguello Warning Area in the Pacific. The 3-stage        standard Pegasus placed three small satellites in a 730 x 750 km x 70.0         deg orbit. The three satellites all use OSC's new Microstar bus design.         Two of the satellites, Orbcomm FM1 and FM2, are the first satellites in         OSC's  Orbital Communications Corp. (Orbcomm) subsidiary's low Earth            orbit (LEO) communications network. They are 1.0m in diameter and 0.16m         high, with a mass of 40 kg; once on orbit they deploy a 3.3m long               VHF/UHF communications antenna and a pair of solar panels spanning 2.2m.        Orbcomm FM2's uplink antenna was malfunctioning last week, but FM1              was operating well.                                                                                                                                             The third satellite is Microlab 1, a 68 kg scientific satellite 1.0m in         diameter and 0.3m high. It carries NASA-MSFC's Optical Transient                Detector experiment to study the global distribution of lightning, and          the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's GPS-MET experiment         which will study the occultation of GPS navigation satellite signals by        the atmosphere to derive meteorological information. Microlab is owned          by OSC, with NASA and NSF renting the space for and operation of their          experiments.                                                                                                                                                    The Orbcomm program has been shrouded in commercial secrecy, with               few details released on the precursor test payloads:                              Satellite     Launch date    Orbit             Design.

The              Shaviyt launch vehicle  took off on a westward trajectory from Palamchim        Air Force Base in Israel and placed the satellite and the AUS-51 solid          motor third stage in a retrograde orbit. 'Ofeq-3 carries an                     electro-optical scanner and has a mass of 225 kg. It has been reported          in the media as Israel's first spy satellite, but I think this is               probably an overstatement. 'Ofeq-3 should probably be considered as             Israel's first 3-axis-stabilized technology development satellite, with         an experimental imaging system (whose resolution may be as good as a few        metres) intended for both remote sensing and military reconnaissance            applications, but it isn't a full fledged spysat.                                                                                                               'Ofeq-3's westward orbit is rare, but not a record; some US Air Force           satellites in the 1960s went to an inclination of 144 degrees to the            eastward equator (i.e. 36 degrees to the westbound equator). There are          quite a few polar retrograde satellites with inclinations up to around          105 degrees, and the GAMBIT spy satellites used inclinations up to 110          degrees regularly in the 1960s and 1970s. Below I give a table of all           satellites whose inclinations exceeded 110.5 degrees.

The reason for the unusual maneuver a week before deorbit                (see JSR 236) remains unclear.                                                                                                                                  My description of the Start launch vehicle last week was inaccurate;            it differs from Start-1 in that there is a new second stage inserted            between the first and second stages of Start-1. According to Maxim              Tarasenko, apparently there are actually six stages including a small           kick motor to circularize the orbit. The failure was in the fourth              stage, and the fifth stage never got a chance to fire. The debris               impacted eastern Russia.

The Global Positioning System Meteorology instrument -- or                 GPS Met -- was launched aboard an Orbital Sciences Corporation                  Microlab satellite on a Pegasus launch vehicle.  The instrument,                developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was successfully                    placed into orbit at 6:48 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time.                                                                                                                From its vantage point in low-Earth orbit, GPS Met will                    receive and track the radio signals broadcast by 24 high-orbiting               satellites of the U.S. military's GPS network.  Just before each                GPS satellite passes out of view of the Earth, its signal, as                   seen by GPS Met, will slice through the atmosphere from the top                 of the stratosphere down to the Earth's surface.  This process is               known as atmospheric occultation or radio occultation.                                                                                                               "As the signal descends, the atmosphere acts as a lens,                    causing the signal's path to bend and its travel time to increase               by a small, but perceptible amount," said JPL engineer Dr. Thomas               Yunck, one of a team of experts who proposed the GPS technique in               the late 1980s. "By precisely measuring the signal's increasing                 travel time and the fluctuating signal strength, we can recover                 highly accurate profiles of  atmospheric density, pressure,                     temperature and, to some degree, turbulence and winds."                                                                                                              "The most obvious scientific application of this technique                 will be monitoring changes in climate by providing precise,                     stable and high-resolution profiles of atmospheric temperatures                 across the globe," added Rob Kursinski, a JPL scientist on the                  GPS Met team.  "The GPS Met data represent the first, hopefully,                in a long-term observation program, which will provide us with                  much needed, long-term information about how trace greenhouse                   gases may be modifying Earth's atmosphere and climate".                                                                                                              GPS Met will also be used to study the amount of water vapor               in the lower atmosphere, the JPL science team said.                                                                                                                  "Water vapor is extremely important to Earth's weather and                 climate system," Kursinski explained.  "It is crucial to the                    operation of the Earth's atmospheric heat engine, which                         redistributes absorbed solar energy to higher latitudes.  Water                 vapor is also the primary greenhouse gas in our atmosphere."                                                                                                         Using the technique of radio occultation to explore                        planetary atmospheres dates back to 1965, when scientists studied               the signal sent back by Mariner 4 as it passed behind Mars. In                  the years since, this technique has been used to study other                    planets in the solar system and their moons.                                                                                                                         "Studying Earth with this technique has been difficult                     because the observations require both a radio source and a                      suitable receiver located off the planet, outside the                           atmosphere," Yunck said.  "Until now, we have not had such                      matched pairs in Earth orbit.                                                                                                                                        "Additionally, to be of use in studying Earth's atmosphere,                whose nature we know quite well, such measurements must be                      continuous and comprehensive," he said.  "We therefore need many                transmitters and receivers aloft at once, densely sampling the                  global atmosphere every few hours.  The cost of such an                         enterprise has generally made it impractical within Earth science               programs."                                                                                                                                                           The advent of microsatellites and small launcher                           technologies is changing all of that. GPS Met is the first                      "proof-of-concept" demonstration of the GPS occultation                         technique.  If successful, it could lead to a future                            constellation of tiny microsatellites, each no larger than a                    small paperback book and weighing less than 2 kilograms (4.4                    pounds), that would continuously survey the global atmosphere                   with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution, Yunck said.                                                                                                      The GPS observations from a constellation of tens or                       hundreds of receivers in low-Earth orbit may have a dramatic                    impact on weather forecasting because they would provide a number               of unique and fundamental features which would complement the                   present suite of worldwide weather monitoring measurements,                     Kursinski explained.                                                                                                                                                 Another important application of the GPS Met technology will               be its ability to map the ionosphere -- the area of the upper                   atmosphere consisting of free electrons.  Low frequency radio                   waves broadcast from Earth interact strongly with the ionosphere.               This interaction allows the radio signals to be sent great                      distances as they are reflected off the ionosphere. Ionospheric                 disturbances have been known to cause violent solar flares, for                 example, which can disrupt radio communications worldwide.                                                                                                           With a large array of orbiting GPS receivers, it will be                   possible to create three-dimensional images of the ionosphere                   that will help scientists map its structure and could give them a               near real-time picture of the ionosphere's often erratic                        behavior, Yunck said.                                                                                                                                                The GPS Met experiment is sponsored jointly by NASA's Office               of Mission to Planet Earth, the National Science Foundation, the                National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the                   Federal Aviation Administration.                                                                                                                                     The instrument was developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion                      Laboratory and is being managed by the University Corp. for                     Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.                                          @START@Device Developed for Bird Protection                                     DEVICE DEVELOPED FOR BIRD PROTECTION                                                                                                                                    EPRI-sponsored researchers have developed a technology                  to help prevent birds from flying into structures that can                      injure or kill them.  The device, which emits a pattern of                      radio-frequency signals that are imperceptible to human beings,                 has been tested successfully in the laboratory.  Now the                        researchers are preparing to test it in the field.                                                                                                                      The technology was conceived for use at wind farms.  But                according to EPRI's Earl Davis, who is managing the ongoing                     research at the University of Pittsburgh, it has the potential                  to be useful in a variety of applications--for diverting birds                  away from airplane engines, tall buildings, and sites containing                hazardous chemicals.  The technology could even be used to drive                nuisance birds away from areas like sports stadiums and hotels.                                                                                                         "The historical approach to this kind of diversion has                  been to use lights and sounds that people can perceive," says                   Davis, "but these techniques are not necessarily the best way of                communicating with animals."  EPRI's technology emits a pattern                 of radio signals in a frequency already approved by the Federal                 Communications Commission for broadcasting.  Since these signals                cannot be detected by human ears, they can be used in areas                     where people are present.                                                                                                                                               The aim of EPRI's research is to successfully startle                   birds away from a given danger zone.  In laboratory tests at the                University of Pittsburgh, researchers have determined that                      pigeons perceive and recognize the radio signals.  Complementary                signals, such as ultraviolet light and sound, may be used to                    enhance the technique.                                                                                                                                                  The next step is to test the device under controlled                    conditions on other bird species in the field.  Commercialization               would follow.  In the meantime, EPRI has applied for a patent on                the technology.  The U.S. Air Force, which is plagued by the                    problem of birds flying into the engines of its aircraft, is                    among the groups that have already shown considerable interest in               the device, Davis says.  "This technology has the potential for                 great commercial value," he concludes.                                          @START@The Polar Ice Caps                                                       Recent events in Antarctica indicate that the polar ice caps may be more        susceptible to melting than previously supposed. The Larsen ice shelf now       appears to be in the process of breaking up: a huge iceberg has broken off      it, but more importantly a large part of the ice shelf has disintegrated        altogether, leaving open water between James Ross island and the Antarctic      peninsula for the first time since Antarctic exploration began. Also there      have been reports of a 40-mile long crack opening up in the Larsen ice          shelf, apparently after the iceberg broke off.                                                                                                                  Temperatures in the Antarctic peninsula (where these events and the earlier     breakup of the Wordie ice shelf took place) have risen by 2.5 C over the        last 40 years. Although some melting of polar ice has been anticipated as       a consequence of global warming, the speed and scale of recent events in        Antarctica appear to have taken the scientific community completely by          surprise.                                                                                                                                                       Ice is not a very good conductor of heat: the thermal conductivity at           273.15 K (0 C) is 2.26 W/(m.K), but it improves slightly at lower               temperatures - at 260 K it is 2.35, and at 240 K it is 2.50 W/(m.K) [from       table 33 "Thermophysical properties of saturated water substance", Handbook     of heat transfer fundamentals 2nd ed., McGraw-Hill 1985]. Putting a             physical perspective to these figures, this is the amount of heat in watts      per square metre that would travel through a 1m thick sheet of ice with a       temperature difference of 1 C between the top and bottom.                                                                                                       Now apply these figures to an Antarctic ice shelf, such as the Larsen ice       shelf. A typical thickness of ice for these is about 200m, and we have          heard that 2.5 C of warming has taken place. Assuming that it has               penetrated the top 100m of ice already, how long would it take to warm the      remainder?                                                                                                                                                           The 100m of ice which has not yet warmed has a mass of about 10e8               g/m^2, to warm this by 2.5 C requires a heat input of 2.5 x 10e8 J/m^2          (assuming a thermal capacity for ice of 1 J/(g.K) - the actual figure           may well be higher, in which case the heat input required will                  increase correspondingly).                                                                                                                                      The heat flux through 100m of ice is (2.5W/(m.K) / 100m) x 2.5K                 temperature difference, or 6.25 x 10e-2 W/m^2. This will take 4 x 10e9          seconds to provide the 2.5 x 10e8 J/m^2 required, or a little over a            century.                                                                                                                                                   Before the ice shelf actually broke up, substantial melting would have to       take place. The latent heat of fusion for the water-ice transition is over      300 J/g. With the heat flux just calculated, it would take over three           thousand years for the bottom half of the ice shelf to melt. No wonder          glaciologists are not too concerned about the prospect of the polar icecaps     melting in the near future!                                                                                                                                     So why is the Larsen ice shelf breaking up? I think it is because of a          physical property of ice that has hitherto been overlooked - transparency.      Water is extremely opaque to infrared radiation of any wavelength, but the      same is not necessarily true of ice. The molecules in water can vibrate or      rotate freely, while those in ice are bound into a rigid crystal lattice        and so cannot move. The various different vibrational and rotational modes      of the water molecule occur at the right frequencies to make it a good          absorber of infrared; when they are suppressed, infrared absorbtion no          longer occurs.                                                                                                                                                  Imagine for a moment that ice is completely transparent to infrared. We saw     earlier how, using regular heat conduction, it would take a century or more     for heat to get through a 100m thickness of ice. Using the same example         given earlier but including the effects of infrared transmission:                                                                                                    for a 2.5K temperature difference at 260K the net heat transmission             is s.T2^4 - s.T1^4 = 269.2 - 259.1 or about 10 W/m^2                            (where s is the Boltzmann constant, 5.67 x 10e-8 W/(m^2.T^4), T1 is             260K, T2 is 262.5K).                                                                                                                                       This is nearly 200 times more than the heat flux calculated earlier.            Instead of taking 3000 years to melt, the ice shelf is gone in little more      than a decade.                                                                                                                                                  With the limited time and resources at my disposal, I have so far been          unable to find any research which conclusively proves or disproves whether      ice is sufficiently transparent in the relevant parts of the infrared           spectrum (from about 4um to 120um) for infrared heat transmission to work.      However, I have found some supporting evidence in the book "Radiative Heat      Transfer" (Michael F. Modest, McGraw-Hill 1993 ISBN 0-07-042675-9). In          chapter 11, "Radiative properties of semitransparent media", there is a         graph (Fig 11-4, p442) "Spectral absorbtion coefficient of clear water (at      room temperature) and clear ice (at -10 C)". It shows that the absorbtion       spectra of water and ice are almost identical for ultraviolet, visible and      near infrared. However, for infrared wavelengths beyond 10um the spectral       properties of water and ice abruptly diverge - the ice becomes                  significantly more transparent than water, so that for a wavelength of 20       um (this is end of the range the graph covers) ice is over 10 times more        transparent than water. Unfortunately, this does not indicate what happens      at longer wavelengths, or when the temperature is lowered or the pressure       increased.                                                                                                                                                      It is also possible that other mechanisms than infrared heat transmission       could give rise to anomalously high rates of long-range heat transfer           through ice - for instance phonons, individual quanta of sound energy, can      probably travel quite long distances through ice and could perhaps              transport significant quantities of heat - they do in liquid helium.                                                                                            Given the evidence that "bulk" ice such as ice shelves and glaciers appears     to be melting at a faster rate than simple theory would suggest, and given      the catastrophic consequences if the polar ice caps should melt, I think        that the possibility that unconventional modes of long-range heat               conduction operate in ice deserves thorough investigation. The experiments      necessary to conclusively settle this issue one way or the other should not     be that difficult or expensive to conduct. Is anyone reading this message       prepared to carry them out?                                                                                                                                     --                                                                              Hugh Easton                             <Hugh@daflight.demon.co.uk>             @START@Hubble Finds New Dark Spot on Neptune                                    PHOTO RELEASE NO.:  STScI-PR95-21B                                                                                                                                     HUBBLE FINDS NEW DARK SPOT ON NEPTUNE                                                                                                                    NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has discovered a new great dark spot,             located in the northern hemisphere of the planet Neptune.  Because the          planet's northern hemisphere is now tilted away from Earth, the new             feature appears near the limb of the planet.                                                                                                                    The spot is a near mirror-image to a similar southern hemisphere dark           spot that was discovered in 1989 by the Voyager 2 probe.  In 1994,              Hubble showed that the southern dark spot had disappeared.                                                                                                      Like its predecessor, the new spot has high altitude clouds along its           edge, caused by gasses that have been pushed to higher altitudes where          they cool to form methane ice crystal clouds.  The dark spot may be a           zone of clear gas that is a window to a cloud deck lower in the                 atmosphere.                                                                                                                                                     Planetary scientists don t know how long lived this new feature might           be.  Hubble's high resolution will allow astronomers to follow the              spot's evolution and other unexpected changes in Neptune's dynamic              atmosphere.                                                                                                                                                     The image was taken on November 2, 1994 with Hubble's Wide Field                Planetary Camera 2, when Neptune was 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion             kilometers) from Earth.  Hubble can resolve features as small as 625            miles (1,000 kilometers) across in Neptune's cloud tops.

It is            funded by a grant from the National Center for Human Genome Research of         the National Institutes of Health.                                                                                                                              The workshop will familiarize biomedical researchers                            in applying supercomputing resources to                                         problems of concern in macromolecular sequence analysis.  Emphasis will be      on alignment of and pattern extraction from multiple sequences.                 Participants will gain practical experience on PSC's Cray C-90 and T3D in       (1) comparing and aligning sequences, (2) identifying informative patterns      in a set of sequences; and (3) using extracted informative patterns to          identify related sequences.  Researchers will also learn several approaches     to database searching and  multiple sequence alignment, how to use profile      analysis effectively, and how to identify patterns in their sequences.          Participants are encouraged to bring sequence analysis problems from their      current research.  Extensive documentation will be given at the outset on       the PSC computing environment as well as on the specific programs               to be employed in the workshop.  No prior supercomputing experience is          required.                                                                                                                                                       Workshop leaders are Dr. Gary Churchill, Cornell University, Dr. Michael        Gribskov, San Diego Supercomputing Center, and Dr. Hugh Nicholas, PSC.

Yesterday, Dezhurov spent 24 hours wearing the Holter Monitor which gathered    data on his blood pressure and heart rate as part of the continuing effort to   establish a baseline condition of the crew members' cardiovascular system.      The Mir 18 commander and his two crewmates also were involved in body mass      measurements which are done periodically during the flight.  They also had      blood draws taken in support of the metabolic research activities.                                                                                              Earlier today, the crew had more work time with the Chibis suit, the Russian    version of the Lower Body Negative Pressure Unit used on the Space Shuttle.     For this session, Dezhurov was the test subject, with Thagard supporting the    experiment.  Chibis suit activities are always coordinated to take place        during a communication pass so flight controllers on the ground can monitor     biomedical telemetry during the experiment.                                                                                                                     Later this morning, Thagard will conduct a television broadcast from Mir where  he will be describing activities and accomplishments that have happened aboard  the station recently.  Following his status report, he will be interviewed by   WPVI-TV in Philadelphia.  Both the status report and the interview will be      carried on NASA TV.                                                                                                                                             Everything remains on schedule for the next cargo supply ship for the Mir       station.  Progress 227 is set to be launched Sunday from the Baikonur           Cosmodrome on a Soyuz rocket at 22:30 Mir Time (3:30 p.m. EDT).  Docking to     the Mir station is projected to take place on April 11 just before midnight     Mir time (5:00 p.m. EDT).  The docking to Mir will be carried live on NASA TV.                                                                                  Progress 227 will deliver a variety of research materials to the orbiting       station.  The equipment aboard includes various kits, logbooks, observation     materials, glovebags, greenhouse fixative, and harvesting materials.  All of    those items are part of the fundamental biology work being done on Mir.         Progress will also bring to the station a Mir Grab Sample Container which will  take air samples in support of the environmental monitoring effort, and blood   and urine collection kits for the metabolic research effort.

Hubble images will show the new dark spot in the                         northern hemisphere of the distant planet Neptune.  Only                        last June Hubble revealed that a great dark spot in the                         southern hemisphere -- discovered by the Voyager 2                              spacecraft in 1989 -- had mysteriously disappeared.                                                                                                                    Hubble images of the asteroid Vesta will show a                          complex surface with a geology similar to that of                               terrestrial worlds such as Earth or Mars.  The battered                         ancient surface -- the oldest terrain ever seen in the                          Solar System -- allows astronomers to peer below the crust.                     Vesta is unique in being the only asteroid astronomers                          actually can study in a laboratory -- thanks to a collision                     blasting a piece of the asteroid's surface into space which                     eventually fell to Earth.  The fragment will be displayed                       at the event.                                                                                                                                                          The event will be carried live on NASA Television                        with questions and answers from participating NASA Centers.                     NASA Television is broadcast on Spacenet 2, transponder 5,                      channel 9, C-Band, located at 69 degrees West longitude,                        with horizontal polarization.  Frequency will be on 3880.0                      megahertz, with audio on 6.8 megahertz.                                         @START@Vesta - Asteroid or Mini-Planet?                                                                  ASTEROID OR MINI-PLANET?                                                HUBBLE MAPS THE ANCIENT SURFACE OF VESTA                                                                                                       NASA's Hubble Space Telescope images of the asteroid Vesta are                  providing astronomers with a glimpse of the oldest terrain ever seen            in the solar system and a peek into a broken off section of the                 "mini-planet" that exposes its interior.                                                                                                                        Hubble's pictures provide the best view yet of Vesta's complex surface,         with a geology similar to that of terrestrial worlds such as Earth or           Mars.  The asteroid's ancient surface, battered by collisions eons ago,         allows astronomers to peer below the asteroid's crust and into the              past.                                                                                                                                                           Astronomers also believe that fragments gouged out of Vesta during              ancient collisions have fallen to Earth as meteorites, making Vesta             only the fourth solar system object, other than Earth, the Moon and             Mars, where scientists have a confirmed laboratory sample.  (About              50-60 other meteorite types are suspected to have come from asteroids,          but positive identifications are more difficult to make.)                                                                                                       "The Hubble observations show that Vesta is far more interesting than           simply a chunk of rock in space as most asteroids are," said Ben                Zellner of Georgia Southern University.  "This qualifies Vesta as the           'sixth' terrestrial planet."                                                                                                                                    No bigger than the state of Arizona, Vesta offers new clues to the              origin of the solar system and the interior makeup of the rocky                 planets.  "Vesta has survived essentially intact since the formation of         the planets," Zellner said.  "It provides a record of the long and              complex evolution of our solar system."                                                                                                                         Resolving features down to 50 miles across, Hubble reveals a                    surprisingly diverse world with an exposed mantle, ancient lava flows           and impact basins.  Though only 325 miles (525 kilometers) across, it           once had a molten interior.  This contradicts conventional ideas that           asteroids essentially are cold, rocky fragments left behind from the            early days of planetary formation.                                                                                                                              Besides providing scientists with direct samples, Vesta's chipped               surface allows Hubble to study the asteroid's rocky mantle, giving              scientists a unique opportunity to see what a planet looks like below           the crust.  "Our knowledge of the interior composition of the other             terrestrial worlds, the Moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury and even Earth,              depends heavily on theory and inference," Zellner said.  "Vesta allows          us to actually see the mantle and study pristine samples in our                 laboratories."                                                                                                                                                  Before these observations, only the smaller and less geologically               diverse asteroids, Ida and Gaspra, have been observed in detail by the          Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft.  Unlike Vesta, these smaller objects          are pieces torn off larger bodies by collisions that occurred perhaps           only a few hundred million years ago.                                           @START@Physics News Update                                                      **********************************************************************          This is a "Physics News Update" distributed by Phillip Schewe of AIP            Public Information.

Schewe and Ben Stein               Number 222  April 17, 1995         American Institute of Physics                                                                                                                                                                                A CIRCUMSTELLAR DUST RING has been observed by the Cosmic                       Background Explorer (COBE) satellite during its survey of the sky.              Computers simulations of the motion of asteroidal dust particles                moving toward the sun had shown that the presence of the Earth helps            to trap some of the particles in a circumsolar ring in which the Earth          is embedded; the disposition of dust would be denser beyond the                 Earth's orbit than inside of it.  Previously, the "zodiacal light"              (reflected sunlight) from the dust had been seen by the Infrared                Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), but COBE's observations are fuller and           more unequivocal.  (W.T. Reach et al., Nature, 6 April 1995.)                                                                                                   INTERGALACTIC MAGNETIC FIELDS are probably very weak but                        may well influence galaxy formation.  These fields might be                     primordial or might arise from magnetized plasma expelled by                    galaxies.  R. Plaga of the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany              suggests that the fields between the galaxies can be detected through           their influence on gamma ray bursts reaching the Earth.  According to           Plaga, fields as weak as 10**-24 gauss would delay the arrival of               some gamma-ray photons by a measurable amount.  He believes that                it might be possible to extract such information from gamma-burst               data of the type recorded by the Gamma Ray Observatory.  (Nature,               30 March 1995.)                                                                                                                                                 THE 1996 FEDERAL R&D BUDGET REQUEST amounts to $72.8                            billion, 52% of which is for the Defense Department, 9.5% for the               Energy Department, and 12.5% for NASA.  Within DOE the request                  (in millions of dollars) for high energy physics is $685.6 (up 6.8%             from FY95), for nuclear physics $321.1 (down 3.1%), and $366                    (down 0.6%) for fusion research.  The high energy request includes              operating budgets of $146.4 for Fermilab, $80.8 for SLAC, and $45.5             for Brookhaven.  Construction projections of note are the Fermilab              main injector ($62.4) and the SLAC B factory ($57.6).  The largest              nuclear physics construction project is the Brookhaven Relativistic             Heavy Ion Collider, at $71.3.  The DOE request for basic energy                 science is $811.4, up 10.6% from FY95.  This includes $169.6 for                materials science, $178.7 for facilities operations, $118.3 for chemical        sciences, and $108.7 for applied mathematical sciences. A separate              category, major user facilities (mostly synchrotron sources at Oak              Ridge, Argonne, Brookhaven, and LBL) will cost $240.  At the NSF,               the request for physics research is $142.2 (up 9.1%), while for                 materials research it is $190.9 (up 8.9%).  The request for geoscience          is $451.5 and for astronomy $110.4.  The NASA request for physics               and astronomy is $1131, including $237.6 for development of the                 Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility, $182.7 for Hubble Space                   Telescope operations and servicing, and $93.2 for small explorer                missions. The NASA planetary exploration request is $827.8,                     including $191.5 for Cassini development, $108.5 for the Mars                   Surveyor, and $75.1 for Galileo operations.  The budget for the                 Mission to Planet Earth is $1341.1.

Washington: National Academy Press, July 1994/315p                                                                                                              America's groundwater resource, which supplies more than 50% of                 drinking water, is threatened not only be excessive overdrafts,                 but by contamination. It is estimated that 300,000 to 400,000                   sites may have contaminated soil or ground water requiring some                 form of remediation.  One 1991 report concluded that over the                   next 30 years the US will spend $480 billion to $1 trillion in                  cleanup activities, with a best guess of $750 billion, or $8,000                per household.  (The magnitude of the problem may be equally                    significant in other industrialized countries.)  Restoration of                 contaminated ground water to drinking water standards is                        possible, but cleanup is inherently complex, and will require                   large expense and long time periods.  The inability of                          "pump-and-treat" systems to reach drinking water standards at                   many sites to date is not only due to complexity, but                           insufficient or inaccurate characterization of the problem.                     "The Committee strongly believes that existing ground water                     cleanup goals cannot be attained in reasonable time frames                      (decades) at a large number of sites with current                               technologies."  Some sites will remain contaminated above                       drinking water standards for the foreseeable future, even when                  the best available technologies are used.  Although long-term                   goals may remain the same, interim objectives are needed to                     acknowledge current technological limitations.

Alas, there is no simple yes-no-answer to this question.  Climate, its          natural vagaries, and the long-term effects of increasing greenhouse-gas        levels are only partially understood.  The shortest defensible answer           I can think of, a first approximation so to speak:  it is roughly an            even bet, fifty-fifty.                                                                                                                                          A nontechnical, by no means comprehensive outline of some of the basic          science behind this answer follows.  Potential impacts and responses            are not addressed.  Please note that this is not my field.  I have a            fair idea of the broad picture, but I don't understand all the technical        niceties.  I tried to sketch some basics in a way which most readers            with some interest in our planet's workings might be able to understand.        For details, good places to start are chapters 1 through 7 of [Houghton]        or, if you want to dig more deeply, the reports [IPCC 90/92/94].  Much          of the following information can be found there.  Some nontechnical             introductory articles are:                                                          [Maskell]    introduction to the basic science                                  [Schelling]  allround:  science, impacts, responses                             [Broecker]   natural climatic variability                                       [White]      history, some basics, climate debate up to 1990                    [Ausubel]    potential impacts;  critical, though not complacent            On the net, [IUCC] provides almost one hundred fact sheets of one to            two pages each that cover science, impacts, and responses.                                                                                                      *  The natural greenhouse effect                                                                                                                                The sun's radiation, much of it in the visible region of the spectrum,          warms our planet.  On average, earth must radiate back to space the             same amount of energy which it gets from the sun.  Being cooler than            the sun, earth radiates mostly in the infrared.  Often, incoming solar          radiation is called `shortwave', whereas outgoing infrared is called            `longwave' radiation.                                                                                                                                           Greenhouse gases and clouds in earth's atmosphere absorb and re-emit            some of the outgoing infrared radiation.  The direction of this re-             emission is more or less random, some going upwards and some going              downwards.  Therefore, only part of the re-emitted infrared radiation           goes out to space.  If earth is to balance the incoming energy, it              may either emit more outgoing or absorb less incoming radiation or              both.  In order to emit more infrared radiation, earth's surface must           warm.  In order to absorb less incoming solar radiation, earth must             increase it's reflectivity or albedo ("whiteness").                                                                                                             Currently, earth's surface has an average temperature of about 15 o C.          However, if you take a look from space, then you find that the infrared         radiation going out to space from the upper atmosphere corresponds to           an average temperature of only about -18 o C.  This is the so-called            `effective radiating temperature' of our planet.  At -18 o C roughly            240 W/m^2 (watts per square metre)  of infrared radiation are emitted.          This is just the amount required for balancing the absorbed solar               radiation.                                                                                                                                                      On the other hand, at an average temperature of 15 o C earth's surface          emits an average of roughly  390 W/m^2  of infrared radiation.  This            amount just suffices to ensure that about  240 W/m^2  will eventually           escape to space, while the remainder is trapped by greenhouse gases             and clouds [Berger].  The `natural greenhouse effect' can be defined            as the 150 or so W/m^2  of outgoing infrared or longwave radiation              captured by earth's preindustrial atmosphere.  It warms earth's surface         by about 33 degrees Celsius.                                                                                                                                    As an aside, note that garden glasshouses retain heat mainly by lack            of convection and advection [Jones].  As we just saw, the atmospheric           greenhouse effect is caused by absorption and re-emission of infrared           radiation.  So the `greenhouse' effect is a misnomer.  We won't get             rid of it, though ;-)                                                                                                                                           Let us fill in a few details.  Under clear sky, roughly 60-70 % of the          natural greenhouse effect is due to water vapour [IPCC 90, p 48],               which currently is the dominant greenhouse gas in earth's atmosphere.           The remainder stems from other greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide,            methane, ozone and nitrous oxide.                                                                                                                               Clouds are another important player in the game.  Beginners please do           not confuse clouds with water vapour: clouds consist of water droplets          or ice particles or both.  Under cloudy sky the greenhouse effect is            considerably stronger than under clear sky [Raval].  Globally and               seasonally averaged, clouds capture roughly 30 W/m^2  of the outgoing           infrared radiation [Berger].  At the same time, cloud tops in the               sunshine look dazzlingly white: they reflect sunlight.  Earth's present         albedo is somewhere near 0.3, meaning that about 30 % or slightly over          100 W/m^2  of the sun's incoming radiation is reflected back to space,          while about 70 % or roughly 240 W/m^2  is absorbed.  Globally and               seasonally averaged, clouds reflect nearly 50 W/m^2  of the incoming            solar radiation back to space, so they are presently responsible for            almost half of earth's albedo.  Overall, given the current cloud pat-           tern of our planet, clouds exert a net cooling effect of roughly  50            (solar reflected)  minus  30 (infrared trapped)  =  roughly 20 W/m^2.           The quantities involving clouds are hard to measure and may vary by a           few watts per square metre, depending on whom you listen to [Berger].                                                                                           The above outline omits convection and evaporation.  If you look more           closely, you find that the atmosphere constantly loses, while earth's           surface, globally averaged, constantly gains radiative energy.  The             radiative cooling of the atmosphere and the radiative heating of the            surface are balanced by convection and by evaporation/re-condensation           (cloud formation)  which `convectively' couple the surface to the               atmosphere [Berger].                                                                                                                                            *  The enhanced greenhouse effect                                                                                                                               During the past two centuries and especially during the past few                decades, human activities have increased the atmospheric levels of              several greenhouse gases.  To name a few:  Carbon dioxide (CO2) went            up from about 280 ppmv (parts per million by volume) in the year 1800           via 315 ppmv in 1958 to 354 ppmv in 1990.  Methane (CH4) increased              from about 0.8 ppmv in 1800 to roughly 1.7 ppmv in 1990.  Nitrous               oxide (N2O) increased from about 0.285 ppmv in 1700 to 0.310 or so              ppmv in 1990.                                                                                                                                                   Enhanced levels of greenhouse gases cause the so-called  `enhanced              greenhouse effect',  meaning that more of the outgoing infrared radia-          tion is trapped by the additional greenhouse gases.  Presently, the             enhanced greenhouse effect is estimated at about 2 to 2.5 W/m^2.                Doubling the preindustrial CO2 level from 280 ppmv to 560 ppmv CO2              enhances the greenhouse effect by slightly over 4 W/m^2.  If business           goes on as usual, the combined effect of the increased greenhouse gas           levels is likely to reach the equivalent of a CO2 doubling around or            before the year 2050 and will hardly stop there.                                                                                                                The enhanced greenhouse effect disturbs earth's radiation balance.              As mentioned, in order to restore the balance, earth's surface may              warm, earth's albedo may increase, or both.  There is broad consensus           among climatologists that at least some surface warming will occur.             It is uncertain, though, by how much and how swiftly earth's surface            will warm.                                                                                                                                                      To the best of present knowledge, the so-called equilibrium surface             warming for a CO2 doubling, also known as the `climate sensitivity',            is likely to sit somewhere between  1.5 and 4.5  degrees Celsius,               with a best estimate of  2.5 o C.  In other words, there is a fairly            broad range of conceivable outcomes.                                                                                                                            Since about 1890, average global surface temperature went up by about           0.5 o C.  There is an uncertainty of roughly a factor of two: the true          warming is likely to lie somewhere between 0.3 and 0.6 o C  [IPCC 90,           IPCC 92].  Even if the warming were known precisely, this would                 presently hardly permit to narrow down the predicted range of outcomes.         Taking into account aerosol cooling and natural climatic variability,           climatologists can only say that the observed warming is consistent             with (although no proof for) the estimated range of climate sensitivity         to human-made greenhouse gases.  Some core uncertainties follow.                                                                                                *  Response time and feedbacks                                                                                                                                  One pickle is the response time of the climate system to greenhouse             gases.  There may be a lag time of a few decades, though this is not            known for sure.  Nor is it known whether it will take decades or                centuries until equilibrium is approached for a given level of green-           house gases.  Much of this uncertainty stems from poorly understood             behaviour of the ocean.  The topmost so-called `mixed layer' of the             ocean is warmer and less dense than the deeper layers, so it tends to           stay on top.  In the northern North Atlantic and near Antarctica some           regions are known, where cool, particularly salty (thus dense) surface          water sinks and deep water forms.  But it is much less clear, how and           how swiftly deep ocean water returns to the surface  [IPCC 90, p xxvi,          p 179-180].                                                                                                                                                     Then there are the feedbacks, including but not confined to:                                                                                                       water vapour feedback          probably positive                                ice-snow-albedo feedback       presumably positive                              cloud feedback                 poorly understood                                feedbacks in the carbon cycle  see below                                                                                                                     It is widely agreed that, without any feedbacks, a CO2 doubling would           eventually increase surface temperature by about 1.2 o C.  However,             warming tends to increase evaporation as well as the amount of water            vapour carried by the lower atmosphere [Raval], and water vapour is             the dominant greenhouse gas.  Snow and ice reflect much of the incident         sunlight back to space, so a reduction of snow and ice cover may                enhance warming.  With water vapour and ice-snow-albedo, but without            cloud effects, many though not all estimates are somewhere between              2 and 2.5 o C for a CO2 doubling.                                                                                                                               The cloud feedback is probably the largest single uncertainty in the            predictions.  This feedback might be large, yet not even its sign is            known.  Deep clouds tend to cool, high clouds tend to warm.  Depending          on whether and how cloud cover changes, the overall feedback may be             negative or positive.  As a further complication, optical properties            of clouds may change in ways that are hard to predict  [Tselioudis].            Many climatologists presume that, everything else remaining equal,              the cloud feedback is likely to be slightly positive, but this is               by no means certain, the more so as not everything else has remained            equal (see below: aerosols).                                                                                                                                    Feedbacks in the carbon cycle, springing from climatic changes or from          rising CO2 levels, may slow down or speed up the rise of atmospheric            carbon dioxide.  To name a few:  CO2 fertilization, higher temperatures         and increasing precipitation can increase plant growth, drawing down            some CO2.  The mix of species in ecosystems is likely to change, which          in turn may affect atmospheric CO2.  Dryer and warmer soils as well as          dieback of vegetation can release CO2.  The overall effect of these and         other carbon cycle feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 is unclear.  If the             relationship between CO2 level and temperature observed over the past           250,000 years should persist in the future, then the long-term climate          feedback on atmospheric carbon dioxide level would be positive.  On the         other hand, ecosystem models tentatively suggest that carbon release            (positive feedback) may dominate over the next decades, while carbon            storage in vegetation and soils (negative feedback) may win out in the          long run [IPCC 94].                                                                                                                                             *  Human-made aerosols and natural climatic variability                                                                                                         It is attempted time and again.  But it is presently hopeless to draw           conclusions from the observed temperature record about the present or           future amount of greenhouse-gas induced warming.  This is because the           effects of at least three factors cannot be disentangled:                                                                                                              human-made greenhouse gases  (warming)                                          human-made aerosols          (cooling)                                          natural climatic variability                                                                                                                             As already touched upon, it is not clear how rapidly the climate will           respond to anthropogenic (human-made) greenhouse gases.  Thus a given           rate of warming does not by itself reveal when and at what level the            warming is eventually going to stop.                                                                                                                            Aerosols are small (0.001 to 10 micrometres) airborne particles.  In the        troposphere, the lower about 10 to 15 km of our atmosphere, human-made          aerosols have greatly increased since about 1850 and present a large            source of uncertainty in assessing the effects of anthropogenic emis-           sions on climate.                                                                                                                                               `Fine' aerosol particles with sizes between about 0.1 and 1 micrometre          can influence climate in two ways.  Under clear sky they scatter and            absorb solar radiation; some of the scattered sunlight goes back to             space (direct effect).  By acting as cloud condensation nuclei, aerosols        may enhance reflectivity and life-time of clouds (the indirect effect).         In this size range, sulfur dioxide  -  yielding sulfate particles after         oxidation  -  is presently the largest source of human-made aerosols.           Probably the next largest source is organic and elemental carbon from           biomass burning.  Both sulfate aerosols and those from biomass burning          have a net cooling effect.  Globally averaged, they may currently cancel        about 50 % of the warming effect of human-made greenhouse gases. So far,        though, confidence in such estimates is low.  The uncertainty margin is         large, ranging from about 10 to 100 %  [IPCC 94, sections 3, 4.4, 4.7].                                                                                         Moreover, global averages may not be adequate for assessing aerosol ef-         fects.  Tropospheric aerosols are unevenly distributed, as most of them         are washed out after about a week.  Anthropogenic sulfate aerosols are          mainly located over Northern Hemisphere land areas.  The distribution of        aerosols from biomass burning is less clear. Human-made greenhouse gases        have life-spans of up to over 100 years and are much more evenly distri-        buted.  Aerosol cooling is not a simple offset to greenhouse-gas induced        warming: even if the global averages cancel, the different distributions        may still cause climatic changes.  Reducing sulfur dioxide emissions or         biomass burning reduces the aerosol effect quickly, leaving over the            effect of the more long-lived greenhouse gases  [IPCC 94].                                                                                                      Estimating aerosol cooling more precisely will be tough.  Aerosols              are difficult to measure.  Particle sizes, compositions and regional            distributions vary.  So do their climatic effects.  Assessing the               latter involves modeling of regional climates and of clouds, both               of which are not yet very reliable  [IPCC 94] [Wigley].                                                                                                         Even less is known about natural climatic fluctuations on a decadal             to century scale.  It is not known what course earth's temperature              would have taken without anthropogenic emissions.  Some players that            may be involved in natural climatic variations on this time scale:              Random atmospheric variability including shifts of the polar front,             variations in the circulation of the North Atlantic and of the                  Pacific Ocean, solar variability, volcanism.  Unraveling climate's              natural vagaries may take a long time: there is a dearth of suffi-              ciently long and detailed climatic records   [Broecker] [Crowley &              North, chapter 5] [Kerr] [Rind] [Schlesinger] [Street].                                                                                                         To provide just one example:  The Little Ice Age is a much discussed            cooling spell with temperature decreases of 1 or so degree Celsius,             lasting from about 1450 to the 19th century.  Even though this is a             quite recent event, the global patterns of the climatic changes                 involved and the mechanisms behind these changes are so poorly known            that, in 1993, Rind and Overpeck wrote, presumably only half jokingly:          "At the present time, it is still possible to question the existence            of the Little Ice Age"  [Rind, p 371].                                                                                                                          *  The ice record of greenhouse gases                                                                                                                           During the past millenium, until about the 19th century, atmospheric            greenhouse gas levels varied little and hence, during that time,                probably contributed little to climatic variations.  On a longer time           scale, changes of greenhouse gas levels probably contributed signifi-           cantly to the coolings and warmings of the last two glacial cycles.                                                                                             Ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica indicate that there was a close         link between greenhouse gases and temperature [Raynaud].  For instance,         the Vostok ice core from Antarctica exhibits a striking correlation             between temperature and the concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2)              and methane (CH4) over the past 250,000 years [Jouzel].  The level of           nitrous oxide (N2O) probably also varied more or less in phase with             temperature [Raynaud, p 928].  The variations of these trace gases              may account for up to about 50 % of the estimated temperature changes           [Crowley, p 2364] [Raynaud, p 932].  CO2 was most important, while              methane and nitrous oxide contributed less.                                                                                                                     During the onset of the last glaciation, the CO2 decrease markedly              lagged the onset of the cooling.  During the past two deglaciations,            CO2 may have risen in phase with temperature or with an, in geologic            terms, modest lag of up to about 1000 years [Raynaud, p 931].  Whether          greenhouse gases led or lagged the climatic change, that is, whether            they were a primary cause for the change or whether they acted as a             positive feedback (which amplified a climatic shift already under way),         is important for finding out just exactly what happened, but it is not          by itself relevant for estimating the effect of the trace gases on              surface temperature  [Raynaud, p 932].                                                                                                                          In spite of this, the effect is hard to quantify.  During the last              deglaciation, roughly 18,000 to 10,000 years ago, the rise of trace gas         levels enhanced the natural greenhouse effect by about 2.5 to 3 watts           per square metre.  The meltdown of the huge glacial ice shields reduced         earth's albedo, accounting for another about 3 to 3.5 watts per square          metre.  These figures are compatible with the IPCC estimate of about            1.5 to 4.5 o C surface warming for a CO2 doubling, but they do not yet          permit to narrow down the uncertainty [Crowley, p 2366].  There remain          many unknowns, some of which follow.                                                                                                                            For instance, in glacial times the atmosphere probably carried more             dust (aerosols) than today, but the average global dust load during             glaciations is quite uncertain  [Crowley, p 2366].  Also, it is not             known whether and how cloud cover changed during glacial cycles.                Getting reliable information on past cloud cover is very difficult;             it may be an insoluble problem  [Eddy, p 147].  Moreover, just how cold         was the last glacial maximum about 18,000 years ago ?  Estimates for            global mean surface temperature at the last glacial maximum range               from about 3 to 5, maybe even 6 degrees Celsius below the present-day           average of about 15 o C  [Barron] [Crowley & North, p 79].  Last but            not least, the sensitivity of earth's present-day climate system to an          enhanced greenhouse effect of so or so many watts per square metre need         not necessarily equal the sensitivity of the last glacial maximum's             climate to the same disturbance.  The starting positions differ.                                                                                                *  Conclusion                                                                                                                                                   Two remarks.  Firstly, current climate models tend to predict gradual           climate change.  This is no guarantee against unpleasant surprises:             climate models are far from perfect, the same holds for the basic               climatologic knowledge which is fed into the models.  Vice versa,               sudden climatic shifts in the recent geologic past do not imply that            similar shifts must necessarily happen in the near future.  Past                climates can help to understand the climate system's workings, but              they do not readily reveal what to expect.  Our climate appears to be           headed for a  "warm atmosphere-cold pole combination"  which may be             unique in earth history.  No completely satisfactory geologic analog            is known  [Crowley & North, chapter 14] [Eddy, p 16-27, 39-71].                                                                                                 Secondly, much of the debate focuses on warming, the most plausible             reaction of the climate system.  Climate, however, may change in a host         of other potentially serious ways.  For instance, spatial and seasonal          precipitation patterns may shift, affecting fresh water availability,           which is critical for many countries and a potential source of con-             flicts.  Cloud patterns, ocean currents, atmospheric circulation or             the distribution of extreme weather events may change.  This is why             many climatologists prefer the term  `climate change'  over  `global            warming'.                                                                                                                                                       It is an open question how soon the uncertainties can be narrowed down,         and whether climatologists will be able to predict details reliably             before they start to happen in the real world.  In spite of a flood             of new results, I am under the, hopefully mistaken, impression that             during the past few years more questions were raised than answered.                                                                                             Human-made greenhouse gases will change our climate.  There is no               free lunch, we cannot alter earth's radiation balance for nothing.              It is uncertain by how much, how swiftly and with what twists the               climate will change, but this is dubious comfort, since uncertainty             cuts two ways.  The present best estimates may well overstate the               risk, but they may as well understate it.  The climate change issue             resembles a gamble with high stakes.                                                                                                                                                                                                            *  References                                                                                                                                                   [Ausubel]   Jesse H.

Those climatologists who told me their          opinion so far found the article reasonable.  Sole responsibility for           errors and misconceptions is mine, however.  Corrections are welcomed,          the more so as my time for maintaining this article is scarce.  Please          note the motto, though:  "not overly detailed" ;-)    Students should           not use this article as a reference for school projects.  They should           instead use it as a pointer to some of the published literature.

The spacecraft was launched Sunday from the Baikonur cosmodrome in             Kazakhstan.  After spending over two days matching orbits with the Russian      space station, the Progress spacecraft docked automatically on the first        attempt.                                                                                                                                                        	The spacecraft carried 400 kg (880 lb) of food for cosmonauts                  Vladmir Dezhurov and Gennady Strekalov and American astronaut Norman            Thagard.  The spacecraft also carried several hundred kilograms of supplies,    25 kg (55 lb) of notes and other papers, and some lollipops.                                                                                                    	The successful shipment permits the crew aboard Mir to continue                their historic mission.  The three men will stay aboard Mir until June,         when the shuttle Atlantis will dock with the station and replace the three      with two Russian cosmonauts .                                                   -----------------------------                                                                                                                                   			     Israel Launches Spysat                                                                                                                                  	Israel launched its first operational surveillance satellite last              Wednesday (April 5), giving the country the ability to quickly obtain           high-resolution images of its neighboring countries.                                                                                                            	A Shavit rocket launched the 225-kg (495-lb) Ofeq-3 satellite from             Palamchim Air Force Base south of Tel Aviv.  The spacecraft was placed          into an orbit 300 to 700 km (185 to 435 miles) above the Earth with an          inclination of 37 degrees.  This orbit permits the spacecraft to pass over      Iran, Iraq, and Syria several times each day.  The spacecraft orbits from       east to west, as opposed to the traditional west to east, as Israel can         only safely launch rockets to the west, over the Mediterranean Sea.                                                                                             	The Ofeq-3 spacecraft is the culmination of an Israeli program to              provide the nation with its own satellite reconnaissance program.  In the       past, the United States had provided Israel with satellite imagery, but         access to this data was believed to be restricted after Israel used it to       coordinate the bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981.  Israel             launched two experimental satellites, Ofeq-1 and Ofeq-2, in 1988 and 1990       respectively, to test the technology needed for a spysat.                       -----------------------------                                                                                                                                   			Cellular Phone Satellite in Orbit                                                                                                                            	An Atlas 2 rocket placed a communications satellite into orbit last            Friday (April 7) that will for the first time permit cellular phone users       throughout North America, whether in a large city or in the wilderness, to      place and receive phone calls at a far smaller cost that current satellite      phone technologies.                                                                                                                                             	The satellite, named MSAT, was launched from Cape Canaveral on the             evening of April 7.  The spacecraft was flawlessly placed in its                geosynchronous orbit shortly thereafter.  The launch was the eighteenth for     the new aerospace conglomerate Lockheed Martin.                                                                                                                 	American Mobile Satellite Corporation, the owner of MSAT, said that            the satellite is the first of its kind that allows cellular phone users to      stay in touch throughout North America.  The system will require a special      phone, with an estimated cost of $1,500, but will offer rates as low as         $0.75 per minute.  To achieve the same level of connectivity before MSAT        required a briefcase-sized satellite phone, which cost $35,000 and charge       rates of $10 per minute.

One of the satellites, Orbcomm 2, has developed a problem with its             uplink receiver, which is used to receive commands from the ground.             Unless this problem is corrected, it is unlikely that the satellite can         function as a part of the Orbcomm constellation.  The other satellite,          Orbcomm 1, was functioning normally after a section of corrupted software in    its GPS receiver was reloaded.                                                                                                                                  	The two satellites, along with a third small scientific satellite,             were launched on a Pegasus off the coast of California.  The launch was         the first successful launch from Orbital Science Corporation's L-1011           aircraft.                                                                                                                                                       	The satellites are the first in what will comprise a constellation             of several dozen small satellites in low Earth orbit.  These satellites will    be used in a variety of largely non-voice communications programs, such as      tracking commercial trucks, monitoring pipelines, and transmitting data         received from remote environmental sensors on the ground.

Once in orbit, the Clark spacecraft (of Lewis and Clark fame) will use          advanced remote-sensing instruments to study changes in the Earth's             environment.                                                                                                                                                    	Clark, and its sister spacecraft Lewis, are among the first                    spacecraft being developed by NASA's Small Spacecraft Technology                Initiative.  The program calls for small, inexpensive spacecraft built          quickly using the latest in technology.  The technology tested by these         spacecraft can then be used in larger, more expensive missions.                                                                                                 	The Lewis spacecraft is being developed by the TRW Space and                   Electronics Group, and will also be launched on an LLV.  The CTA-built          GEMStar(r) communications satellite will be launched into a near-polar          orbit later this year by an LLV.                                                -----------------------------                                                   * Space Policy *                                                                                                                                                	Walker Proposes Multiyear Authorization for Space Station                                                                                                      	In a move widely seen as an effort to placate international                    partners, House Science Committee chairman Robert Walker has introduced         legislation that would authorize funding for Space Station Alpha for the        remainder of its construction.                                                                                                                                  	Walker (R-PA) introduced legislation last week that would authorize            $13.2 billion dollars for construction of the space station between now and     2002.  The $13.2 billion dollar figure comes from the $17.4 billion cap         placed on the project by President Clinton minus two $2.1 billion               appropriations already made for the project.                                                                                                                    	Although it is unlikely that the appropriation will pass in both               houses of Congress, especially since no companion bill has been introduced      in the Senate, approval of the authorization in the House would be seen as      a victory for space station proponents, who have struggled in recent years      to support the program.  It is also believed that this authorization would      be seen by the station's international partners as a sign that NASA and         Congress are serious about completing the station.                              -----------------------------                                                   U.S. May Permit Commercial Use of Ukranian Rockets                                                                                                              	The United States and the Ukraine are discussing a bilateral space             launch trade agreement what would permit U.S. companies to use Ukranian         rockets, such as the Zenit and Cyclone.  At least one multinational venture     using these rockets is being planned.                                                                                                                           	Such an agreement would pave the way for Boeing to proceed with                its Sea Launch project, which would use Zenits launched from offshore           platforms in the Pacific.  Boeing is currently working with SC Energia and      NPO Yushnoye in the former Soviet Union and Norweigan shipbuilding              conglomerate Kvaerner A/S on the project.                                                                                                                       	Under the current Sea Launch proposal, mobile launch platforms                 would be based off the coast of California.  Before a launch, a Zenit           rocket and payload would be brought aboard and the launch platform would be     towed south to the Equator, where a launch would gain the maximum benefit       from the Earth's rotation.                                                      -----------------------------                                                   * Space Science *                                                                                                                                               ESO Telescope Project Threatened                                                                                                                                	A project to build the world's largest telescope in Chile is                   threatened with cancellation unless European and Chilean officials can          resolve a dispute over the land on which the telescope is being                 constructed.                                                                                                                                                    	The family which claims ownership of Cerro Paranal, the mountaintop            where the telescope is being built, has filed suit against the European         Southern Observatory (ESO), claiming the land was illegally seized by the       Chilean government in 1988 and given to ESO.  ESO claims to be immune to        lawsuits in Chilean courts and, according to the Chilean Foreign Minister,      may scrap the project if the lawsuit is not resolved.                                                                                                           	A decision may come as soon as April 19, when representatives from             ESO's eight member nations -- Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the     Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland -- meet to discuss the project.                                                                                            	The $500 million project would build four 8-meter telescopes which,            when combined, would have the power of a single 16-meter diameter               telescope.  Currently the largest telescope in the world is the Keck            Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, with a diameter of ten meters.                  -----------------------------                                                   @START@Earth Day 25 Years Later                                                 Earth Day 25 Years Later                                                                                                                                        We must strive to achieve a sustainable society                                                                                                                 by Gaylord Nelson                                                                                                                                                    On April 22, 1970, Earth Day was held, one of the most                          remarkable happenings in the history of democracy.                              Fully 10 percent of the population of the country,                              twenty million people, demonstrated their support for                           redeeming the American environment. . . . American                              politics and public policy would never be the same.                             (American Heritage magazine, October 1993)                                                                                                                 The idea of Earth Day 1970 was to have a national demonstration                 of environmental concern big enough to shake up the political                   establishment--get its attention, get some action, force                        environmental issues onto the political agenda of national                      priorities.  The idea worked, thanks to the spontaneous response                of millions of concerned Americans, and the event served as a                   wake-up call to the political establishment.  Suddenly, the                     environment became a national political priority.                                    Since Earth Day 1970, Congress has enacted nearly 40 major                 federal environmental laws addressing a wide range of issues,                   including clean air, clean water, energy conservation, hazardous                wastes, and herbicides and other pesticides.  Dozens of                         individual public land bills have been enacted since 1970 to                    designate or expand wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers,                   national parks, and wildlife refuges.  Perhaps most important,                  more than 80 percent of Americans now regard themselves as                      environmentalists.                                                                   Since 1970 we have come a long way.  After 25 years of                     researching, debating, and learning, increasing numbers of people               recognize that the state of the environment is the key factor in                determining our way of life and the quality of it.                                   Increasingly, we are coming to understand that air, water,                 soil, forests, minerals, rivers, lakes, oceans, scenic beauty,                  wildlife habitats, and biodiversity constitute the wealth of the                nation.  This is our capital.  In short, these resources are all                there is.  That's the whole economy.  That's where all the                      economic activity--and all the jobs--comes from.                                     Nonetheless, this simple proposition is conveniently                       overlooked when doing so serves some immediate political or                     financial interest.  That's why we so frequently hear political                 and business leaders, economists, and others who should know                    better vacuously assert that they "are for the environment if it                doesn't cost jobs."  This misses the obvious point that a healthy               environment and a prosperous economy are inextricably tied one to               the other.                                                                           In the jargon of the business world, the economy is a wholly               owned subsidiary of the environment.  All economic activity is                  dependent on that environment, on its underlying resource base.                 If the environment is finally forced to file under Chapter 11                   because its resource base has been polluted, degraded,                          dissipated, and irretrievably compromised, then the economy goes                bankrupt with it because the economy is just a subset within the                ecological system.  When the environment is sacrificed in the                   short-term interest of creating jobs, the cost and long-term job                loss always exceed the immediate benefit.  Consuming capital and                counting it as income--this is the road to bankruptcy.                               At this point in history, no nation has managed to evolve                  into a sustainable society.  All are pursuing a self-destructive                course; we are all fueling our economies by consuming our                       capital--that is to say, by degrading our resource base.                             Recently, in a joint statement, the United States National                 Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of London, two of the                 world's leading scientific bodies, addressed the state of the                   planet in the following words:                                                                                                                                       If current predictions of population growth prove                               accurate and patterns of human activity on the planet                           remain unchanged, science and technology may not be                             able to prevent either irreversible degradation of the                          environment or continued poverty for much of the world.                         (Population Growth, Resource Consumption, and a                                 Sustainable World, 1992)                                                                                                                                   This sobering observation confronts us with the challenge to                    significantly reduce population growth in the next few years and                achieve population stability before the mid-21st century.                            Right now, we are dealing with a social, ecological, and                   economic challenge unlike any other in our history.  This                       challenge is far more serious than the military threat to the                   democratic West in World War II.  Nations can recover from lost                 wars--witness Germany and Japan--but there is no recovery from a                destroyed ecosystem.                                                                 On December 5, 1962, Dean Acheson, in a speech at West                     Point, observed that "Britain has lost an empire and has not yet                found a goal."  Ironically, that describes the current American                 dilemma.  The Soviet superpower has disintegrated, the Communist                menace has dissolved, and the Cold War is over.  As yet, as a                   nation, the United States has not found a unifying theme, a moral               cause to replace the Cold War--this despite the fact that a                     monumental moral cause is near at hand, a far more serious                      challenge than the Cold War ever was.  It's the war against the                 planet.  How do we bring it to an end, and where do we start?  We               must start in the United States.  We cannot and should not wait                 for the rest of the world.                                                           Truly understanding that sustainability is the ultimate                    issue will bring America face-to-face with the political                        challenge of forging a sustainable society during the next few                  decades.  It is a challenge America can meet if we have the                     leadership and the political will to do so.                                          Nearly 60 years ago, in a speech in Philadelphia on June 27,               1936, President Roosevelt said:                                                                                                                                      There is a mysterious cycle in human events.  To some                           generations much is given.  Of other generations much                           is expected.  This generation of Americans has a                                rendezvous with destiny.                                                                                                                                   This eloquent exhortation fits well the generation now coming of                age.  The challenge of creating a sustainable society implies a                 bigger rendezvous with history and a bigger destiny than                        Roosevelt was thinking about in 1936.  With enough determination,               Americans can measure up to the challenge.  I am optimistic the                 generation now preparing to take the helm will have the foresight               and will to do so.                                                                                                                                              (Nelson, formerly a U.S. Senator from Wisconsin, was founder of                 Earth Day 1970.  He is currently Counselor for the Wilderness                   Society.  In addition, he is Chairman of Earth Day XXV, a group                 that is helping to organize a national Earth Day event on the                   Mall in Washington, DC.)                                                        @START@The Earth is in Your Hands                                               The Earth is in Your Hands                                                                                                                                      Working together, we can achieve a new generation of                            environmental protection                                                                                                                                        by Carol M. Browner                                                                                                                                             Earth Day 25 is a time to reflect on how we're doing in                         protecting our environment.  Twenty-five years ago, in the wake                 of the first Earth Day, our nation created, virtually from                      scratch, the most advanced system of environmental protection in                the world.                                                                           In the course of a very short history--a mere quarter-                     century--we have made tremendous progress.  We no longer have                   rivers catching on fire.  Our skies are cleaner.  And U.S.                      environmental expertise and technology are in demand throughout                 the world.                                                                           In the years since the first Earth Day, EPA banned lead in                 gasoline, lowering lead levels in our air by more than 90 percent               and protecting millions of children from harm.  We banned                       dangerous and widely used pesticides like DDT.  We closed unsafe                local garbage dumps all over the nation and helped to make                      recycling a household habit.  We provided American towns with                   substantial funding for wastewater treatment--the second biggest                public works effort in U.S. history, resulting in cleaner rivers                all over the United States.  All cars and trucks now have                       standards for fuel economy, set by EPA, that allow consumers to                 choose a car for its energy efficiency.  And EPA has played an                  important role in ensuring that companies and others comply with                our environmental laws or face stiff penalties.                                      Perhaps most important, the nation has gained a new                        understanding.  More Americans than ever understand that to                     ensure a good quality of life for ourselves and our children, we                must act as responsible stewards of our air, our water, and our                 land.                                                                                                                                                           More to Do                                                                                                                                                      But much remains to be done.                                                         Thirty years after Rachel Carson warned us in Silent Spring                to reduce our dependence on pesticides, we have doubled our                     pesticide use.  Twenty-five years after the garbage-filled                      Cuyahoga River spontaneously caught on fire, 40 percent of our                  rivers and lakes are not suitable for fishing or swimming.                           In 1993, people in Milwaukee, New York, and Washington, DC,                were ordered to boil their drinking water.  In Milwaukee,                       hundreds of thousands of people got sick from contaminated water;               100 died.  Twenty years after passage of the Clean Air Act, two                 in five Americans still live in areas where the air is dangerous                to breathe.  Fourteen years after Love Canal, one in four                       Americans lives within four miles of a toxic dumpsite.  Asthma is               on the rise.  Breast cancer is on the rise.                                          And the past 25 years have left us with a complex and                      unwieldy system of laws and regulations and increasing conflict                 over how we achieve environmental protection.                                        The result of this history?  An adversarial system of                      environmental policy.  A system built on distrust.  And too                     little environmental protection at too high a cost.                                                                                                             The Challenge We Face                                                                                                                                           In the next 25 years, we must maintain the progress we have made,               and we must build on that progress.  We must continue to protect                the health of the people of this country, the health of our                     communities, the health of our economy, our air, our water, and                 our land.                                                                            The environmental problems of the future will be more                      complex than ever.  We can work together to address these                       problems today, or we can handle them as expensive crises                       tomorrow.                                                                            When President Clinton and I arrived in Washington two years               ago, we believed that we needed a fundamentally new system of                   environmental protection.  One that protects more and costs less.               And one that builds on the strengths of the last 25 years but                   overcomes the deficiencies of the past.                                              We have an opportunity to reinvent a system of strong public               health and environmental protections--to find solutions that work               for real people in real communities.  We must do it with common-                sense, cost-effective measures that produce the very best                       environmental results for the least cost.                                            In this new system, we need a firm commitment to public                    health and environmental goals--combined with flexibility,                      innovation, and creativity in how we achieve those goals.  We                   must move beyond the one-size-fits-all approach of the past.  We                must work industry by industry, community by community to prevent               pollution, rather than clean it up after the fact.  We must                     involve those who will live with environmental decisions, to                    ensure that they have every opportunity to be a partner in making               those decisions.                                                                                                                                                New Strategies for the Future                                                                                                                                   In the last two years, the Clinton Administration has initiated a               variety of strategies to reinvent environmental protection--to                  move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and move toward a                      flexible yet firm approach to pollution protection.  These                      strategies will allow us to achieve results that are cleaner,                   cheaper, and smarter.                                                                 Last year we launched the Common Sense Initiative, a                      fundamentally different way of doing business that takes us                     beyond the pollutant-by-pollutant, crisis-by-crisis approach of                 the past to an industry-by-industry approach for the future.                    Beginning in six industries, we are bringing together leaders of                business, state and local government, the community, labor, and                 the environmental movement--to sit down and examine environmental               protection in these industries from top to bottom.                                   By working together, we will be able to find answers to the                tough questions and arrive at solutions never before thought                    possible--solutions that will be cleaner for the environment,                   cheaper for the taxpayer and industry, and smarter for the future               of this country.                                                                     Through our Brownfields Action Agenda, we are working in                   partnership with state and local government, communities,                       industry, and small business, to clean up the contaminated pieces               of land that sit idle in cities across this country--to bring                   them back to life, to remove a blight on the neighborhood, to                   create jobs, to create hope.  We recently lifted the Superfund                  stigma from 25,000 sites around this country.                                        Recognizing the need for quality science in all that we do,                we recently launched our STAR program--Science To Achieve                       Results--bringing the best and the brightest from across the                    scientific community to assist us in our work, so we can direct                 our resources to the highest risks and do it using the highest                  quality data.  Five thousand graduate students in science are                   competing for 100 fellowships in research at EPA.  We've expanded               our use of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis.  In fact,                 the National Academy of Sciences has recognized EPA as a world                  leader in using risk analysis.                                                       These are some of the strategies we are using to reinvent                  environmental protection.  All of these strategies work for                     business, for communities, and for people across the country.                   All of these are new strategies that will take us to the future.                                                                                                We Must Reinvent, Not Repeal                                                                                                                                    Last month, the President, the Vice President, and I announced                  the Clinton Administration's regulatory reinvention of                          environmental protection.  Through a package of important                       reforms, we will trust honest business people as partners, not                  adversaries--without sacrificing one ounce of public health                     protection.                                                                          We will cut paperwork by 25 percent, saving 20 million hours               a year for business and communities.  Time and money should be                  invested in making a product, not filling out forms.                                 We will allow a six-month grace period--to give small                      business owners a chance to fix compliance problems instead of                  paying a fine.  We will reward companies that take responsibility               for finding and fixing environmental problems.  Our goal is                     compliance with the laws that protect public health and the                     environment--not punishment.                                                         We will institute one-stop emissions reporting and                         consolidate our air-pollution rules.  Instead of a dozen                        different rules and a dozen different forms, our goal is one                    rule, one permit, one report.                                                        Under our new Project XL--excellence and leadership--we will               choose 50 businesses and communities and say to them, "Here's the               pollution reduction goal.  You know your operation better than                  anyone else.  If you can figure out how to reach the goal and                   exceed that goal, then you can throw out the rule book."                             Through the Clinton Administration's regulatory reinvention,               we are refining environmental protection to make it more                        flexible, more effective, more sensible, and more affordable--to                achieve the very best environmental results for the least cost.                      These reforms will move us beyond rigid, one-size-fits-all                 regulation.  But unlike proposals for regulatory reform being                   debated in Congress, these reforms do not cross the line to one-                size-fits-all deregulation.                                                          We need to reinvent environmental regulations--not repeal                  public health protections.  The Clinton Administration's                        regulatory reinvention will help us work together to protect our                health and our environment--and do it through common-sense, cost-               effective measures.                                                                  After all the progress we've made since the first Earth Day                25 years ago, we cannot go back.  We must go forward.                                                                                                           Every American Must Help                                                                                                                                        It is the job of government to protect the public.  But                         government cannot do the job alone.  We need every American to                  help ensure strong public health and environmental protections.                 Joining together is not a matter of choice--it is a necessity.                  We all breathe the same air, drink the same water, and work and                 play in the same environment.  That's why EPA is using this 25th                anniversary of Earth Day to remind parents and kids, communities                and companies that "the Earth is in your hands."  If we join                    together, we can take the common sense steps we need to take--and               be proud to pass along a safe, clean world to our children and                  our children's children. #                                                                                                                                      (Browner is Administrator of EPA.)                                              @START@The Average Urban American                                               According To...

If you've placed a permanent swap file on a compressed disk, you've got         an invalid configuration.  (This is documented in the notes on                  DoubleSpace, although it could have been made a little more prominent a         restriction.)                                                                                                                                                   Since Windows 3.1 came out long before MS-DOS 6, the Windows setup code         has no idea what compressed disks are, and much less idea that they             aren't an appropriate place to put a permanent swap file.  The result           is that the WIN31 virtual memory setup logic will cheerfully propose            your compressed disk as a good place to put the swap file; you've got           to make sure that you change it to an uncompressed disk.  (Note that            when you create a compressed drive, DoubleSpace will recognize a                permanent swap file and move it to the host (uncompressed) drive.)                                                                                              Unfortunately, Microsoft chose not to include in MS-DOS 6 a replacement         for the Windows module that controls the allocation of a permanent swap         file.                                                                                                                                                           If necessary, reduce the size of the DoubleSpace compressed volume to           free up enough space on the (real) host drive, then allocate the                permanent swap file there.

The swap file for Windows must be on an               uncompressed drive. If you didn't know, doublespace (and all                    compression software for that matter) creates an uncompressed drive for         every compressed drive, called the host drive. It basically has your            autoexec.bat, config.sys, etc file that you need until the drivers for          the compression software  are loaded at boot time. Using the the                doublespace software, increase (I think it's actually decrease the size         of the compressed drive) the size of this drive to the size you want            for your swap file.  Then tell windows to put it there. If you have one         drive, C:, then the uncompressed drive is usually D:..Otherwise the             uncompressed drives start after the last compressed drive. Hope this            helps,                                                                                                                                                          Craig "Lynx" Leikis                                                             Email Address: CLEIKIS@delphi.com                                               Never wrestle a pig.

You don't say what flavor of PS/2-70 you've got; your description of            the failure makes me suspect that you were sold a memory kit that isn't         compatible with your particular system.  (Sort of like some auto parts          house selling you an engine for a Chevrolet without asking if you've            got a Blazer or a 'Vette.)                                                                                                                                      My references (which may not be complete) don't indicate that any               PS/2-70 is capable of using a 4 MB simm *in a motherboard slot*.  If            you have a memory expansion card you can use 4 MB simms (IBM part               number 87F9977), but the memory slots on the motherboard can accept             only 1 MB (p/n 6450603) or 2 MB (p/n 6450604 for 85 nsec, p/n 6450608           or 6450609 for 80 nsec) simms.  Which 80 nsec part is used depends on           the flavor of PS/2-70 you have.                                                                                                                                 Using the wrong type of simm can do all sorts of mischief -- I speak            from experience.  The good news is that (at least for me) there was no          damage to either the system or the incorrect simm.

I had the exact same symptoms trying to get a Hayes Optima 144 PC Card          modem working in my notebook machine.  After a lot of head scratching           and conversation with the Hayes Tech Support folks (good people), it            was discovered that there was a defect in the cable between the modem           and the telephone jack.  It did not make a good enough connection for           the modem to be able to detect the dial tone.  After replacing the              cable, and making sure it was fully seated in the telephone jack and            the modem connector (you think it is going to break before it snaps             in), everything worked fine.                                                                                                                                    I suggest you start by carefully examining the cabling between the              modem and the telephone jack.  Make sure the connectors on both ends            are well seated and making good contact.  Make sure the cable itself            does not show any signs of stress where the wires may have broken               inside the insulation.  Also, check out the telephone jack itself.              Look for the same things in the jack and the cable going back to the            service connecting block.  (Of course, the easiest way to make these            checks is to try another cable and telephone jack.;-))                                                                                                          From what you said in your message, it looks like your machine and              software is working properly, so if you need to call someone, I would           start with the modem manufacturer.

I had it fix             them as best it could, and tried to get on with my life.

WordPerfect 6.0a for Windows refused to launch without a tantrum. I             kept getting faults in module SHWIN20.DLL, the QuickCorrect list was            garbaged totally, and the program threw GPFs every time I did anything          complicated - like hitting Return at the end of a paragraph.                                                                                                    I copied SHWIN20.DLL from my boss's machine. No fix. I reinstalled WP.          No fix. I reinstalled Windows. No fix.                                                                                                                          I called WP Support and they told me that what had most likely happened         was that what had probably happened was that the initializiation files          WP keeps in the Windows directory had been corrupted. I had to delete           three files, at which point WP came up as if it had just been                   installed. I lost my Button and Power bar configurations, and had to go         all through my Preferences resetting everything -- directories, file            locations, etc.                                                                                                                                                 Fortunately, the guy at WP gave me a tip, which I now pass on:                                                                                                  Copy the files STANDARD.WPT, WPCSET.BIF and WPQC60US.DAT from your              Windows directory to a floppy. If WP hangs up again, and you get the            same errors, just delete those files from your HD and copy them back            over from the floppy. Saves you hours of tedium reconstructing your             working environment.  I've already had to do it once since the original         crash. I suspect my HD needs some work, but haven't had the time to             take care of it.

Memmaker added the "/X" option to SMARTDRV.EXE?  That's a new         one on me - I've never seen that before.  Just out of sheer curiosity,          did you select (at any time during the memory optimization process) the         "use conservative settings" (or words to that effect)?  This might've           added the "/X" to disable write-behind caching, which is a conservative         setting.                                                                                                                                                        > I used to see a table during boot that said SmartDrive was                    > loaded and it indicated various cache settings.  I don't see                  > that anymore.  I assume that is because of the /x switch that                                                                                                 Change the "/X" to "/V", and reboot.  You should then get the caching           table upon boot.  Also, if you need to look at this table again, you            can simply key-in "SMARTDRV" (with no options), and it will display             that caching table without making any changes.  The "/V" means                  "verbose".  Replacing the "/X" with the "/V" will also re-enable the            write-behind caching.                                                                                                                                           Disabling write-behind caching, while smart for compressed                      (DBLSPACE'ed/DRVSPACE'ed) drives, will negatively impact performance on         a system that's not using disk compression.  You're more-than-likely            better served with write-behind caching on - it will make a dramatic            performance difference when there's a substantial amount of disk                activity occurring, especially on systems with older drives.                                                                                                    Also, you might want to add FASTOPEN.EXE to work in conjunction with            SMARTDRV.EXE:                                                                                                                                                      LH C:\DOS\FASTOPEN.EXE C:=100 /X                                                                                                                             Place that line just *before* the SMARTDRV.EXE line (so SMARTDRV will           take advantage of FASTOPEN's file quick look-up table when the data it          needs isn't in cache).  What FASTOPEN.EXE does is, instead of caching           file *data*, it caches the *location* of the file(s) on the disk.  The          next time that file is needed, if it is not already (or has been                flushed out of) SMARTDRV's cache, the disk controller is fed the exact          location of that file on the disk (instead of searching for it in the           FAT) and the hard disk's heads are literally sent (jumped) right to             that location to begin reading.  The "C:=100" means reserve table space         for 100 files for the "C:" drive, while the "/X" means place this table         space in eXtended memory.  You can add as many drives as you want               ("C:=100 D:=100 E:=100..."), but make sure that you have the "/X"               switch and HIMEM.SYS enabled so this table will go into eXtended memory         - it can get quite large if you reserve space for many files/disks.

Advances in computer and networking technologies have fueled the rapid          growth of research and development in multimedia computing and                  high-speed networking. As emerging multimedia technologies set higher           performance levels at competitive costs, they are starting to enable            and proliferate multimedia solutions in a spectrum of commercial and            laboratory projects.                                                                                                                                            The object of this conference is to bring together researchers,                 developers, and practitioners working in all facets of multimedia               computing and networking. The conference will serve as a forum for the          dissemination of state-of-the-art research, development, and                    implementation of multimedia systems, technologies, and applications.           Presenters will be encouraged to make multimedia presentations and              demonstrate their solutions.
