     ======================================================================
 
          "FurBytes" is an attempt to have a short, hopefully monthly  news
     fanzine centered around furry fandom.  Why do something like this?
          Most people who _c_o_u_l_d qualify as "furry  fans"  don't  even  know
     that  such  a thing as furry fandom exists, and even the ones who have
     been involved in it for a while can go a long time without having more
     than  a  foggy  idea  of where other people with similar interests are
     located, what they're doing, what they  publish,  and  lately,  who've
     they've been fighting with.
          "FurBytes"  will  be  likely  to  have  convention  listings  and
     addresses  for  fan  publications.  News  from the publishers and from
     fans will be stuffed in here, and I'd like to see the inclusion  of  a
     "furry  fandom directory."  Letters of comment are welcome (in fact, a
     LoC section could be _m_o_r_e than just  welcome--it  could  almost  be  a
     centerpiece of a 'zine like this).
          As you might have guessed, a large part of future issues  depends
     on  what people send me.  Being a typical furry fan, I, too, am mostly
     in the dark when it comes to events going on outside my area; while  I
     try  to  scrounge  out  as  much  information  as I can, having people
     actually _t_e_l_l me things would make it much easier!
          While  I  will  try  to  list  every convention I know of where a
     "furry party" is  planned,  conventions  where  furry  fans  are  just
     planning  to show up are also welcome.  Free "advertisements" can also
     be submitted as long as they're within the theme of FurBytes.
          Conventional  and  E-Mail addresses for me (Watts Martin) will be
     listed at the end of this, and future, issues.

          For a first issue, this seems like a good  question  to  address.
     Unfortunately,  it  seems  to  be one that's caused more than a little
     disagreement among furry fans.  Part of this article was taken from an
     "about  furry  fandom"  file  that  has  made its way to several BBS's

     across  the  country.  If you're not a furry fan, this should give you
     an idea of what "furry fan" implies, and might let you know whether or
     not  you  really are a furry fan and just don't know it.  If you are a
     furry fan and you don't like this definition, feel  free  to  complain
     about  it (several people I know already have).  I have been told that
     the file was  originally  written  by  "Dr  Pepper,"  but  have  never
     actually seen it with credits attached.  I have assumed both this file
     and the messages from the DeathStar BBS which follow  it  are  in  the
     'public  domain,'  as  they  were  originally  found without copyright
     notices on public-access BBS's and that, therefore, their  authors  do
     not  mind  if people outside these boards have the chance to read them
     in this form.
          First--now  that  the  question's been brought up, just what IS a
     furry, anyway?  Simply  enough,  a  furry  is  a  funny  animal  taken
     seriously.  Roger  Rabbit,  Bugs  Bunny,  and  Mickey  Mouse are funny
     animals; they are anthropomorphic, mostly behave like people, and  are
     pretty   much  the  cartoon  equivalent  of  character  actors.  Usagi
     Yojimbo, Omaha the Cat Dancer, and the original Teenage  Mutant  Ninja
     Turtles  are  furries  (even  though turtles don't have fur); they are
     even more anthropomorphic in appearance than the  funny  animals  are,
     but behave like crosses between humans and animals.  They are sapient,
     and just as much "people" as any fictional character, but they  aren't
     presented  as  animals  for  laughs.  Most  furries tend towards their
     human aspects, their "species" not all that important.  Some are  more
     strongly  tied  to the animals they are to, perhaps 'regressing' under
     stress (for example, Vincent on "Beauty and the Beast," who is perhaps
     the  'furriest'  creature  known to audiences--a nonhuman, animalistic
     character portrayed in a fairly realistic manner).
          Even  if  you  have  no idea who Usagi Yojimbo and Omaha are, you
     could be a furry fan and not know it.  Most funny animal fans are also
     animation  fans, and there is a lot of "crossover" between devotees of
     anime (Japanese animation) and the  furry  world.  If  you  enjoy  old
     Warner  Brothers  cartoons  or  Disney  films such as "The Fox and the
     Hound," "Lady  and  the  Tramp"  or  "Oliver  and  Company"--or  other
     animated films such as Bluth's "The Secret of NIMH" or Nelvana's "Rock
     and Rule"--there is at least a little furry in you.  There  have  also
     been  furry  novels,  of  course, ranging from Andre Norton's _B_r_e_e_d__t_o
     _C_o_m_e to Olaf Stapledon's _S_i_r_i_u_s_:__A__F_a_n_t_a_s_y__o_f___L_oe___a_n_d___D_i_s_c_o_r_d  and
     Steven Boyett's recent _T_h_e__A_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t__o_f__S_l_e_e_p.  A furry "ography"
     has been batted around on some California  BBS's;  perhaps  this  will
     find its way into a future issue of FurBytes.
          However, there is another use of "furry," a way of referring to a
     funny-animal/furry  fan.  For most people, this is where the idea gets
     fuzzy, if you'll pardon the expression.  I have not been involved with
     fandom  all  that long--I have not attended that many conventions, and
     my first one was the 1986 WorldCon in Atlanta--and so have been mostly
     an outside observer in the "fandom is a way of life" versus "fandom is
     just a goddamn hobby" debate.  I have been around long enough  to  run
     into  people  on  both sides, ranging from the casual observers to the
     fanboys from hell to people who  really  do  seem  to  make  fandom  a
     profession.  As  to whether or not any of the rest of this describes a

     "typical furry fan:" from what I've seen, _t_y_p_i_c_a_l__f_a_n is an oxymoron.
 
     Furry Fandom Observed (credited to Dr Pepper)
 
          This  is an attempt to concisely explain furrydom to the curious.
     I am not myself a member of this group, this is what I have been told,
     have  heard  and read, or just observed in action. This is by no means
     complete but it is a start towards understanding. 
 
     1. In the simplest terms furry fandom is the admiration  of  creatures
     that  have  both  human and animal traits.  Since such do not actually
     exist, this  is  considered  a  subgenre  of  science  fiction/fantasy
     fandom. 
 
     2.  One  aspect  of  this  is  simply  liking so called "funny animal"
     cartoons and comics, such as Bugs Bunny, Tom  &  Jerry,  et  al.  Such
     creatures  are  not  conceived  with much logic, and it is their human
     references that are important, the animal shape is more for humor than
     anything else. 
 
     3. Then there is the envy of certain traits observed in animals.  Such
     traits include speed, strength, grace, beauty, cunning and  of  course
     possession  of  fur.  Most  of the animals people are attracted to are
     mammals, hence the term "furry," but nothing is excluded. 
 
     4. This leads to the desire to put oneself in the animal's place so as
     to be able to really experience what it is like to be so gifted. 
 
     5.  But  most  people  want  to  have  this experience with human type
     sapience.  This  leads  to  the  postulation  of  various   kinds   of
     creatures.
 
     6.  Real  animals  that somehow can think and talk.  A lot of folklore
     and mythology is mined for source material for these.  Of more  recent
     vintage  is  the  idea  of  using  biological or digital technology to
     augment ordinary creatures. 
 
     7.  Sapient  analogs  of  certain  animals.  These  include   parallel
     evolution  on other worlds, human genetic intervention, and additional
     evolution, say due to massive radiation. 
 
     8. Gene  spliced  creatures  made  to  order.  These  can  range  from
     customized  humans  to  totally  new  beings  made  with  the  desired
     combination of traits. 
 
     9. Furry fans like to read and write stories involving  any  of  those
     creatures,  admire  and create art featuring them, and play games that
     include them.  This includes playacting, such as answering  the  phone
     with a "meow."
 
     10.  But  some people are more than just furry FANS.  These people are





     FurBytes [The Electronic Furry Fanzine] #1 - Mar 1990                4
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
     simply called FURRIES.
 
     11.  Furries  are  those  who  get  into the concept so much that they
     deliberately develop  alternate  personas  that  actually  have  those
     animal  traits.  Each  persona takes on a life of its own in a sort of
     controlled schizophrenia such as  ventriloquists  and  fantasy  gamers
     practice.  [Ed.  Note:  I  don't  agree that role-playing of any sort,
     furry persona or Dungeons and Dragons,  should  accurately  be  called
     "controlled   schizophrenia,"  any  more  than  an  author  should  be
     considered schizophrenic if she has the ability to create and maintain
     believable characters in a novel.]
 
     12.  Furries  have  many  different  ways  to  relate  to  their furry
     personas.  Some think of them as totally different beings  who  happen
     to  live  inside  them.  Others  see  them as simply minor varients of
     themselves.  And still  others  see  them  as  vehicles  for  normally
     suppressed aspects of their own personalities.
 
     13.  The  most interesting way of viewing a persona, though, is to see
     it as some sort of mystical entity that can confer benefits which  are
     represented  by  the  animal  shape.  Some  relate  this  to a witch's
     familiar or to the spirit guardian of the Plains Indians.  This can be
     taken  literally, that is with actual belief in such entities, or in a
     Jungian fashion, that the animal shape is a  symbolic  key  to  unlock
     unconscious abilities.
 
     14.   Fine.  So   what   do  furries  do  with  their  personas?  They
     communicate through them.  The definition of  the  persona  determines
     how the furry will express themself.  This can be quite different from
     how the actual person  does  it.  This  may  facilitate  communication
     under circumstances in which the person would normally feel inhibited.
 
     15. In fact it has been claimed that, despite the impression one might
     get about the persona as "putting on a mask," the use of  the  persona
     actually  enables  a  person  to be more genuinely themselves.  That's
     because the persona  has  more  freedom,  not  being  subject  to  the
     stifling layers that social convention puts on us mere humans. 
 
     16. Long as we're getting free of social conventions, we might as well
     get to sex.  Most furries are interested in the concept of sex between
     themselves  as themselves, or themselves as their personas, with other
     such creatures.  This differs  from  simple  bestiality  in  that  the
     partner  is  another  mature  sapient.  So  regardless  of the species
     difference, it remains full participation sex between two people.
 
     17. Dear me, did I say two?  Two is another social convention.  A  lot
     (most?) furries like group sex.
 
     18.  In fact, social conventions seem to go down like dominos once one
     gets started.  That may be why so many (most?) furries are bi.

     19.  Let us now pause while the straight and monogamous folks come out
     from wherever they just dived into for cover.
 
     20. Ok, didn't mean to chase anyone off.  The point is  that  wherever
     may  be  on the spectrum, from full fledged furriness to just a reader
     of "Panda Khan," there is a place in furrydom for you.
 
     [end of file]
 
          For another perspective, we switch  coasts  from  the  California
     furry  BBS's  to the now-defunct DeathStar BBS of Washington, DC.  The
     difference between east coast and west coast  furry  boards  is  quite
     noticeable:  west  coast  systems  tend  to have a lot more 'involved'
     people wandering around them, but are also often harder to follow  for
     a  newcomer.  California  boards  usually assume everyone knows what's
     going on; on DeathStar, there were only two or three  people  who  had
     involvement  with  "furrydom"  outside  that  BBS  itself; despite the
     apparent disdain both the system and the furry SIG operator were  held
     in by many West Coast fans, it was one of the few boards which delved,
     even briefly, into the philosophy of furry fandom:

     Furriness.  Why you guys need to categorize it and analyse it; I don't
     know.  What it is:  I can only tell you what it is for me.
 
     For  me,  it's  an expression of parts of my personality that normally
     wouldn't get an outlet.  It's Role-Playing that doesn't use a  set  of
     rules.  For  me,  it's mostly an expression of myself for the people I
     care for.
 
     Having  a  furry  persona  allows  me  to  look   at   things;   Life,
     relationships, mostly social activities, from a different perspective.
     But,  it's  a  creative  tool.  I  use  my  personas   to   test   the
     possibilities of relations.  An aggressive persona would handle things
     one way.  A timid one, another way.  Games.  For me, it's an elaborate
     game.
 
     I've  been  a  Furry  for as long as I can remember in my role-playing
     days.  It's a way to be different.  I feel I'm better able  to  accept
     the differences in other people because of it.
 
     It's  hard  trying  to explain this.  I'm not making too much sense to
     myself, cause it would take most of this hard-disk to write  down  all
     of  the  little nuances and quirks of why I am what I am.  It's a part
     of me.  It's a part of me  that  really  doesn't  and  shouldn't  need
     explaining.  I  think you guys should get away from worrying about why

     Actually, I understand what you are getting at.  My own  furry  allows
     me to view myself from the outside, and is also a reflection/extension
     of my own personality.
 
     Yeah, having a furry is great if you  tend  to  be  shy  or  not  very
     social.  I've  made  a lot of friends though furry fandom and have yet
     to really lose one.  And like you said, it's fun!
 
     ---
          So, have I scared anyone off with this?  Hopefully not.  Speaking
     of a "furry philosophy" may at first strike one as odd, but  I'm  sure
     that  if  one  was  willing to take the time, volumes of philosophical
     claptrap could be produced by talking to any serious  fan,  regardless
     of  his  or  her  personal  hobbyhorse.  Furry  fandom  _i_s more openly
     sensual than a lot of other fan groups I've seen, except for  some  of
     the "Beauty and the Beast" 'zines that have popped up recently (and if
     Vincent isn't a furry, I don't know what is), but this doesn't have to
     be considered a negative.
          If you have any comments on  this  article,  send  'em  on.  Ever
     since  I  became  involved  with  furry fan art and fiction, there has
     seemed  to  be  a  division  between  fans  caused  by  the  perceived
     explicitness of much of the work.  While I'm of the opinion the degree
     of "explicitness" is vastly overstated, there have been at  least  two
     'zines started with the apparent intention of being less explicit than
     FurVersion, the largest furry 'zine--and at least one started with the
     intention of being _m_o_r_e explicit than FurVersion....

     This list includes BBS's that have either a general "furry conference"
     (marked by {f}) and/or furry-oriented storyboards  {s}.  A  storyboard
     in this definition is a free-form role-playing game where participants
     take the roles  of  different  characters  (furry  or  otherwise)  and
     interact  with  other  characters, like a conventional RPG but without
     referees.

     Yep,  pretty  short  right  now,  eh?  If  you'd  like to increase its
     length, drop me a line via mail or BBS with your info.  I have no idea
     what,  if  anything, you'll gain by being listed here, but it probably
     can't hurt.
 
     Format: State/Zip & City listed first, followed  by  name  and  street
     address.  This  should make it easier to locate people in your general
     area than a straight alphabetical listing would.
