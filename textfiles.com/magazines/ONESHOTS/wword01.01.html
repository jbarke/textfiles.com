Introduction to The Web Word
**************************************************

The Web Word is a service for people and organisations with a professional 
interest in the worlds fastest growing information system - the World Wide Web. 
The WWW is expanding and developing so fast (it is doubling in popularity every 
4 months) that no one can keep up with the latest developments. That is where 
The Web Word comes in! 

The Web Word is published 10 times a year with a special bonus issue in January 
of each year. It will keep you informed of:

     - the latest services available on the WWW and
       other interesting Internet services,
     - a Top Ten list of Web sites and Web Users,
     - Important, up to date news about the Web,
     - publish interviews with prominent WWW
       personalities (This months interview is with
       QuoteComs Chris Cooper),
     - look in depth at innovative WWW services
       (This month its Reuters New Media),
     - Keep you up to date on the latest WWW
       software releases

The Web Word is available to subscribers in 3 forms:

1. A standard text email (such as this)
2. A html document ready for Web use (just load it into your
   Mosaic client and go.
3. A searchable Web server of html documents incorporated into
   our information bases on management and technology.

You choose what service you want.

The Web Word will live and die on its usefulness to you, the Web community. As 
such we want and appreciate any feedback you can give us to improve ourselves. 
Help us please. Send mail to webinfo@euronet.nl

The Web Word is not just an email service. Within the next few weeks Information
Innovation will be going live with a full Web server containing the Internets 
largest repository of information for the manager, technologist, and finance 
professional. Information bases already constructed for this service include:

The Management Guide
--------------------
A guide for managers in the information age. The Guide consists of 22 parts, 
each concentrating on a particular technology or issue facing managers. Topics 
range from Artificial Intelligence and Telecommunications to Finance and 
Marketing. Each part contains references to additional valuable information, 
including CD ROMs, conferences, magazines, articles and books. Hundreds of 
illustrations are used. This is the Internets first professional encyclopaedia 
of Management and technology.

http://www.usc.edu/dept/raiders/
An inter-disciplinary team at the University of Southern California has a WWW 
server that allows users to tele-operate a robot arm over the net.  Users view 
the environment surrounding the arm via a sequence of live images taken by a CCD
camera mounted on a commercial robot arm.  The robot is positioned over a 
terrain filled with sand; a pneumatic system, also mounted on the robot, allows 
users to direct short bursts of compressed air into the sand at selected points.
Thus users can "excavate" regions within the sand by positioning the arm, 
delivering a burst of air, and viewing the newly cleared region. To operate the 
robot you'll need an ethernet link and a WWW client that handles forms.

two investments. The first two investments of the fund are Cascade Systems 
International Inc. and Electronic Submission Publishing Systems Inc.

Adobe has promised to provide $25m in investment funds and act as the exclusive 
limited partner of Adobe Ventures. Adobe also transferred its shares in two 
other companies, Crosswise Corp. and Saros Corp., into the Adobe Ventures 
partnership. Cascade is developing technology for electronic pre-press and

Electronic Submission is a systems developer/integrator of comprehensive 
electronic publishing systems for managing, publishing and distributing 
regulatory submissions.

Embedded Program Objects In Distributed Hypermedia Systems
----------------------------------------------------------
Researchers at the U. of California have created software for embedding 
interactive program objects within hypermedia documents. This UC software is the
first instance where program objects have been embedded in documents  over an 
open and distributed hypermedia environment such as the  World Wide Web on the 
Internet.

The researchers' first application, already ported to an X Window environment, 
enhances NCSA Mosaic -TM- -a client program for the WWW- so that the user can 
interactively control the display of a 3D medical image -generated from a 
gigabyte-sized data set- on a window within a Mosaic document. The user can 
rotate the object at will, zoom in or out, do oblique sectioning, highlight 
hidden parts, alter the color mapping and image contrast, all under real-time 
control. These capabilities represent a substantial improvement over current 
image display applications in Mosaic, which are limited to display of static 
images and non-interactive playback modes.

Many additional applications could include:
- internet accesible on-line databases, software libraries, and
  software  demos which involve large-scale data processing
- 'smart' documents for personal forms, financial or consumer
  transactions, credit reports, confidential communications,
  etc.
- real-time high-level information exchanges, such as multiuser
  CAD
- multi-users 'groupware' programs

Section 4: Under the Microscope...
           Reuters New Media
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

This month The Web Word takes a closer look at one of the giants of electronic 
information, Reuters. Based in New York, Reuters NewMedia, Inc., a new business 
unit of Reuters, has developed a reputation for aggressive moves in cyberspace. 
RNI has taken positions in a number of cyber companies, notably Reality 
Technologies, Inc., inGenius Inc., and Ad-Value, Inc. in the past year.

It is no exaggeration to say that Reuters, the parent company of RNI, dominates 
many areas of electronic financial information and it will be interesting to see
if Reuters has just discovered a new data pipe for selling its information or is
embarking on a more radical change in strategy. Is the Web server a small 
addition to its recent diversification’s into cyberspace or something more 
fundamental?

It seemed to be an inevitable step when RNI announced last month that it was to 
open a WWW service. The Web Word interviewed Pierre Wolff of RNI (and the man 
responsible for developing the planned service), what we can expect from this 
move into the Web.

WWW  Reuters has just announced its first move into the Web.
     Why has Reuters done this?

PW   Reuters understands the impact that the Internet could
     have on its future and has made a conscious effort not to
     be left out of the coming information revolution. As well,
     it is important to begin to understand how this medium
     might provide a useful platform for commerce in the
     future, even if only as a prototype initially.


WWW  What services are you planning?

PW   Currently, two Web servers are being planned for release
     in the short-term with other offerings coming in later
     months based on the response we get from these first
     trials.  One will be primarily an information site,
     providing those interested, with what Reuters NewMedia is
     all about, and what services and products we offer.  The
     second server will enable users to search through archival
     news information by a number of criteria including free
     text searches.  This site will also have some interesting
     and "off-the-wall" stuff that we run into in the news
     business all the time.


WWW  What advantages does the Web have for you?

PW   Various.  Many people are getting access to the Web which
     provides a large user base to provide services to.  It
     breaks down some of the restrictions that many of the on-
     line service providers had on publishers. The Internet,
     but especially the WWW, offers an open medium for anyone
     to publish as they wish, what they wish.  Though this
     could be perceived as a risk for us, given all of the
     "niche" publications that are resulting from this, we feel
     that our content will remain strong enough to compete at
     all levels. Here at NewMedia our mission is to look at new
     media and new markets. Essentially (if you'll pardon the
     pun) "go where no Reuters has gone before".  We are
     looking at how to leverage the parent company's
     competencies and assets into new market areas.  So far it
     all looks very promising, and the Web offers some new
     opportunities.


WWW  What are the disadvantages?

PW   Today, the disadvantages lie primarily in the security
     issues, certainly as perceived by potential users, user
     interface limitations, and speed and cost as functions of
     each other. But these are all temporary states that are
     being addressed by a number of dedicated companies and
     individuals. We have a lot of confidence in what the
     future will bear from all of their efforts.  Having seen
     some of the fruits of these efforts I'm very enthusiastic
     as to the opportunities that will be emerging over the
     next six months to one year.


WWW  What equipment are you planning to use?

PW   Digital Equipment Corp. is supplying us with our firewall
     equipment and software and we will use Sun workstations as
     our servers.


WWW  How popular do you expect these services to be?

PW   We really don't know, which is the biggest dilemma in
     putting up a service on the Net today. Every major company
     doing something in this area is having a tough time with
     this same issue. I think its popularity will be based on
     the quality of the content and the ease at getting at this
     information. So far the average number of users that
     subscribe to Net-based services, particularly those on the
     WWW, is approx. 800 to 1000 users per month. 
     Unfortunately, even this figure isn't very consistent
     across the same type of services.


WWW  Are there plans to extend other Reuters software to take
     advantage of the Internet? For example your personal
     investment product Reuters Money Network?

PW   Reality Technologies' products, Wealth Builder and Reuters
     Money Network, are not scheduled to go on the Net in the
     first phase of deployment.  However, we plan on having a
     Web server where information on their products will be
     available as well as some useful investment news
     information that applies to those interested in personal
     finance matters.

     As you might know, Reuters also has interests in the
     education market which is led by a joint-venture with TCI,
     called inGenius.  Opportunities for developing software on
     the WWW for this market might be considered as so many
     schools currently have access to the Net. Other
     opportunities exist in our vast video archives.  Reuters
     has many areas that it might be able to capitalize on the
     Net but first we must see what results can be obtained
     from those initial services that we launch.


WWW  Does Reuters use the Internet internally for
     communications within the company?

PW   Not at this time.  However, we are investigating the Net
     by using individual accounts and getting familiar with the
     possibilities that are available.  We expect this activity
     to grow and for NewMedia in particular, we expect to have
     direct access to the Net in the short-term.


WWW  How does the Web fit into Reuters other electronic
     businesses?

PW   Potentially quite nicely, but we must be careful not to
     jump in too aggressively before all of the pieces are
     there. Today, Reuters has one of the larger global public
     data networks and it can guarantee performance and
     security on it.  These are tremendous selling points when
     you are selling to the financial services industry, where
     those features make or break their businesses.  The
     Internet is not up to that level of quality today, and so
     it is not yet a real issue for those areas.  However, the
     accessibility extended by the Net is desirable which might
     drive changes in the future.


WWW  Reuters has a long tradition of innovation in delivering
     information to its clients. What are the next steps for
     the company on the Web?

PW   Today, Reuters information can be found through services
     such as PSI and Clarinet on the Internet and the various
     on-line service providers such as CompuServe, America On-
     line, Prodigy, and others.  Today these are just
     newsfeeds.  The future for us here is one where we provide
     value-added information products and not just commodity
     news.  After all, if its not targeted information in this
     media rich world, its just a commodity.  We are looking at
     technologies that will enable us to provide the value-
     added side of delivering quality and timely information to
     the desktop of both business users and individual
     consumers.  The Web will provide for us the springboard to
     more quickly deploy new technologies and see how they
     impact our users. We are currently exploring technologies
     that will help users get the most out of their search
     beyond text matching.  These technologies are easily
     deployable over the WWW and can give us the insight for
     our non-Internet based products.


WWW  What do you personally think of the Web? The good aspects
     and the bad?

PW   I'm the wrong guy to ask, because I got a job out of
     knowing my way around it, and being very enthused with the
     opportunities it offers for commerce.  However, I have
     been most attracted to it because of the somewhat
     self-deterministic nature of the beast.  Though I feel
     it's a good environment to conduct business, I don't want
     to ruin it like all of our other mediums.  After all,
     commercialism has pushed things so far that people are
     looking at the Internet as a way to start doing business
     in a different and less intrusive way.  I'm not in this
     for "how can I take advantage of this virgin territory",
     but more, "how can I facilitate how we do business over
     this medium on a global basis without getting in each
     others' faces". I also like the fact that now everyone has
     the opportunity to be published without the need for some
     massive printing press or a publisher to back you. It's
     the spirit of capitalism all over again with everyone
     having the opportunity to be heard and to do business on
     fairly equitable level.

     insight into Reuters New Media.

Section 5: This Months Interview...
           QuoteCom
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

This month The Web Word interviews Chris Cooper, founder and owner of QuoteCom. 
This is a stock quotation Web service which has generated great interest both 
within the Web community and in the financial services industry in general.


WWW  What first made you think of offering this sort of
     service?

CC   I have a background in the both the financial markets
     and in running a software company.  Once I got involved
     in the Internet and realized that a commercial quality
     service to provide stock quotes and other financial
     information to that community did not exist, I decided
     to start QuoteCom.  In that sense, you can say that I'm
     an opportunist who saw an unserved market and rushed to
     fill the void...I just happened to be well-qualified to
     fill this particular niche.


WWW  How popular is the service you currently offer?

CC   We're doing quite well.  We're adding subscribers at a
     constant rate which shows no signs of slacking.  Since
     we've done no traditional advertising, I'm very
     encouraged.  In fact, if our growth was any faster, we
     would be unable to handle it at the moment.


WWW  When did QuoteCom ‘open its doors’ for business?

CC   July 1, 1994.  I started the company in October, 1993
     and it took 9 months of development and testing before
     we were ready.

WWW  What advantages does QuoteCom have over more traditional
     stock services?

CC   We try to capitalize on the advantages that the Internet
     provides us.  For example, this means that we don't have
     to build a nation-wide dial-up network, and we don't
     have to do technical support on modem problems.  We're
     able to develop using existing Internet tools, and when
     we make a change in our service our customers see it
     immediately -- they don't have to wait for us to ship
     them a disk.  It's easy and inexpensive to communicate
     with our customers...we send them email once a week,
     which would be prohibitively expensive to do via regular
     mail.


WWW  What are the disadvantages?

CC   Not everybody has Internet access, and it's still not as
     easy as it should be to learn how to use the Net.  This
     drives potential customers away before we even get to
     see them.


WWW  What has been the biggest challenge in making QuoteCom
     a reality?

CC   The learning curve is pretty steep and long.  I've done
     most of the programming myself, and I didn't know
     anything about UNIX when I started.  Since UNIX is still
     the best way to make services like ours available to the
     Internet community, I had to learn a lot.


WWW  Who are your target markets?

CC   Our appeal is especially strong to retail investors and
     casual traders.  Institutional investors and
     professional traders are well-served by alternatives
     that, while expensive, are reliable and comprehensive.
     We prefer to take advantage of the cost savings that the
     Internet provides and pass it on to the customers who
     are the most cost-sensitive.


WWW  How have you been marketing the service?

CC   A combination of: 1) Posting occasional notices in the
     Usenet investment newsgroups; 2) Traditional public
     relations; 3) Pursuing site licenses with Internet
     providers; 4) Word of mouth.


WWW  What equipment are you using?

CC   A network of Sun workstations and PC's.  The PC's handle
     the ticker feed and news feeds.  The Suns handle the
     interaction with the Internet.  We have a high-speed T1
     connection to the Internet.


WWW  Are there plans to make alliances with other content
     owners?

CC   Absolutely.  QuoteCom plans to become the center of the
     Internet as far as financial information goes.  We
     expect to have everything here that is of interest to
     investors...to be as close to a one-stop shopping center
     as possible.


WWW  Do you have new services planned?

CC   We just added PR Newswire and BusinessWire.  We have two
     more business news services planned soon.  We'll soon
     add a collection of financial newsletters.  A stock
     screening and ranking program is in the works, and more
     third-party content is under negotiation.


WWW  What are the next steps for the company on the Web?

CC   We would like to support secure transactions.  Once
     these are in place, we can add features such as on-line
     trading.  Of course it's only a dream right now, but we
     would ultimately like to provide an electronic exchange
     for traders that can avoid some of the inefficiencies
     inherent in today's exchanges.


WWW  What do you personally think of the Web? The good
     aspects and the bad?

CC   From a user's point of view, I love the variety and
     richness of information that is available.  I love the
     tremendous ease of visiting places located anywhere in
     the world.  I dislike the buggy nature of many of the
     Web browsers.  I dislike the lack of sites that make me
     want to visit them again and again.

     From a provider's point of view, it is tremendously easy
     to develop applications for the Web.  We made the
     decision early to support people without Web access.  If
     we hadn't done this, our development would have been
     much easier, but our market would have been much smaller
     initially. It is disappointing how much effort it takes
     right now to get users connected and using a Web
     browser.


WWW  Thanks for talking with us and letting our readers have
     an insight into your innovative business.

Introduction

Interested in how your stocks and bonds are trading today? Looking for advice on
investments? Want to find out what a companies financial situation is? Cant 
remember the title of that great paper on Stochastic Analysis and Japanese Stock
Exchanges? Want to talk to other people with similar interests?

Put as briefly as possible, this guide gives you:

          1. Some encouragements and warnings
          2. Tips on how to exploit the Web
          3. Tells you what is available
          4. Shows you where to get what you want

Good luck!


-------------
The Good News
-------------

The good news is that the Web can supply you with all of the above and this 
month The Web Word shows you where to finds the best finance information using 
the Web. Many people both new to the WWW and more experienced internetters are 
often surprised at the detailed and diverse sorts of information which can be 
reached using the WWW. Much of the information is completely free and sources 
which charge are often cheaper to use than services not on the Internet.

The main part of this guide is an alphabetical listing of places which have 
financial information. Like most Internet areas, the Web suffers from a lack of 
organisation. The information you want is often available, but how do you find 
it amongst the hundreds of thousands of other Internet sources?


------------
The Bad News
------------

There are some places which consist of lists of sites, they are often organised 
by topic or subject area. None however are complete. There are now a large 
number of books now published on paper which are designed to guide you, but as 
the Web is changing and expanding so fast these are out of date before they are 
on the shelves of your local book shop. The Web Word is a happy medium between 
the printed word and the Web itself. It filters information for its readers and 
removes a lot of the time wasting and boring searching of the Internet.

Efficiently getting what you want out of the Web requires experience which many 
business professionals simply do not have the time to do. This is why The Web 
Word publishes a guide on two levels. The A to Z listing is the raw information 
for those who know exactly what they want.

The additional level of information is a roadmap to steer you through the 
information overload of the Internet. If this is what you want then keep 
reading, if not skip the following and go directly to the A to Z guide to 
Finance.


---------------------------
On-line Investment Services
---------------------------

The Web is the worlds richest and most diverse source of financial information 
but it is also not the friendliest. There are alternatives, all of them costing 
more money but still popular with many people. Remember that these are mostly 
only available within North America:

- America Online has Morningstar investment reports and a small portfolio 
service.

- CompuServe has many discussion groups on investments and markets, including 
the SEC filings service. Has world-wide coverage.

- Dow Jones News/Retrieval is an expensive (for the individual) specialised 
service but they also have a service called Market Monitor which is accessible 
outside of peak times at a cost of about US30 dollars a month.

- Quicken and Quicken Companion 2.0 for Windows lets you track stock prices via 
CompuServe but this costs US1 dollar a minute.

- Reuters Money Network for Windows is a fixed price service which not only 
gives you stock prices but also a personalized news service extracted from Dow 
Jones News Wire. Prices per month begin at around US10 dollars plus US7 dollars 
for the news service.

- StreetSmart from Charles Schwab deals only with your Schwab investments and is
charged for as you use it. The Dow Jones News Wire and Schwab company research 
reports can also be used, but at a pay per view.

- Value Line Service lets you use the Dow Jones Retrieval Service but for about 
US30 dollars a month.


---------------------------------
How to Use the Web to do your Job
---------------------------------

The Web is an asset which you can use to your benefit. If you know how to avoid 
getting lost in an information overloaded Internet then it can be exploited in 
unexpected ways. The purpose of this section is to give you some useful tips 
about how to do this. First it is best to start with some business home truths 
about the Web:

1. It is a huge collection of information stored in a number of electronic 
formats and organised in a myriad of different ways. The Web itself provides 
only primitive ways of searching for data. I say primitive advisedly. This is 
because although incredible new facilities like natural language WAIS searches 
are possible, and hypertext linking is a basic feature of the Web, the 
implementations are haphazard. Using the Web effectively involves the user in:

     - learning new software (usually your Mosaic client).
     - accepting less than 100% availability of the
       information.
     - preparing to be surprised as new features are added
       almost daily.
     - learning to get the information you expected but not
       having it packaged neatly in the form of a consultants
       report.

This is not yet industrial strength software, but the information is real and 
can be valuable to you.

2. The Web is not simply a passive repository of information. It has been built 
by a great many people and these people are available to answer specific 
questions, give clarifications, and are often very helpful sources of further 
information. 

3. The Web is an open asset for you and is only as good as the people using it. 
If you have information which you think is interesting and worth publishing, 
then find a way to put it on the Web. This helps everyone. Just think of the 
information out there already, available free or at moderate cost.
