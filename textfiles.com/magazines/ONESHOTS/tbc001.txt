Introduction
        by Shredder

Right now, you're probably wondering, "Who the hell is TBS? And what the
hell is THIS?" THIS is Taco Bell Core, the monthly online magazine/newsletter
thingy of TBS. Where we put out information/interesting things written by
us and anyone else who wants to send us something. Stuff we've written,
found, leeched off the Internet. TBS is the Taco Bell Syndicate. A group
of people who believe in the power of computers and freedom of information.
We believe in sharing knowledge freely with everyone. Anyways. Enough
introductory stuff. This issue was pretty easy to throw together from stuff
we all had lying around. But we can't do the next one without some outside
stuff. We take all submissions dealing with computers, security, freedom
of information, the government policies on the above, telecommunications,
etc. Just send it to tbs@tacobel.UUCP and if we like it, we'll print it.
If you'd like to be put on the TBS mailing list and receive this every 
month, send your internet address to postmaster@tacobel.UUCP. Whee.

Operation Sundevil: What was it?
        by Shredder

        Operation SunDevil, a legendary event in computer history. But what
was it and what were the results of it?
        On May 9, 1990, the U.S. Attorney's in Phoenix, Arizona released to
the press an announcement of a crackdown on "illegal computer hacking
activities". The official name for this action was "Operation SunDevil",
named after the mascot of Arizona State University, where this case started.
        Twenty seven search warrants were used on May 8, 1990, resulting
in four arrests, with 150 Secret Service Agents carrying out the operation.
Operation SunDevil was an effort to arrest several hackers to posting stolen
credit card codes and telephone calling card codes. The targets for this 
crackdown had been selected through a detailed two year investigation. Forty
two computer systems were seized by the US secret service, and about twenty
five of them were actually running bulletin boards. During 1990, the 
Phoenix branch of the Secret Service had close to 300 BBS's that were
under observation, and all of them had been either called by Secret Service 
agents or by informers, who passed logs of their sessions on to the Secret
Service. The four people who were arrested were: "Tony the Trashman" in
Tucson, AZ on May 9th, "Dr. Ripco", sysop of the Ripco BBS, was also
arrested, on illegal firearms possessions however. Also arrested were
"Electra", in PA, and an unnamed male juvenile hacker in PA. 
        Along with the forty or so computers taken, the Secret Service also
took approximately 23,000 disks, and unknown quantities of printed material,
computer printouts, magazines, notebooks, diaries, non-fiction books on
hacking, and anything else that caught the Feds' eye.
        The Secret Service claimed in a press conference on May 9, 1990, that
the primary purpose of Operation SunDevil was to send a message to the  
hacking community, that they could not hide behind the "relative anonymity
of their computer terminals.", and that the Feds could and would bust them.
They said that this bust "should convey a message to any computer enthusiast
whose interests exceed the ethical use of computers." But who is to decide
what are the so-called "ethical uses" of computers?
        The outcome of Operation SunDevil was a let down for the Feds. They
had sent their "message", but only one indictment was served as a result
of the arrests. Prosecutors involved in the case say chances are "extremely
high" that all charges will be dropped. In the end, this two year, expensive
operation resulted in not much of a real prize for the Feds, and shows
that even if you do get arrested, the Feds don't really have much of a 
case against you, even if they do take all your stuff.

Our Friends, the Concord Journal
        by Keith Cathode
         
This comes from the wonderful Concord Journal.

                        CALLS TRACED TO COMPUTER HACKERS
                        By Shannon Strybel
 
A two month spate of constant hang-up calls has been linked to a group of 
school-age computer hackers, according to Concord Police LT. Leonard 
Wetherbee.
        Wetherbee says that a group of computer aficionados, ranging from 
elementary school children to high schoolers, are probably responsible 
for a great majority of hang-up calls received by residents throughout 
town.
        So far three teens have been identified, but in their ongoing 
investigation police suspect a much larger group of students is 
involved.Because they are juveniles, police cannot legally reveal their 
names.
        The lieutenant says the station has been flooded with reports 
from residents saying they've received calls at all hours, and at regular 
intervals since December.
        "What these kids are trying to do is to find other computer 
systems and see if they can break into them. They think it's a great 
challenge."
        The kids set up their computer telephone modem to automatically 
dial hundreds of phone numbers until it finds another computer system. 
They put in a series of numbers, say from 369-000 through 369-1000, and 
the computer dials each number," explained Wetherbee. "As soon as a human 
voice picks up, it hangs up because it is not a computer."
        Wetherbee says he has received reports from companies in Concord 
who 's computer systems have been breached, but because the investigation 
is on going, he declined to state which companies. According to the 
lieutenant, many companies have systems which notify them through a print 
out when there has been an attempted or a successful break into their 
computers
        Inspector Paul Malone says he has identified three of he alleged 
computer hackers by tracing who owned the computer technology and 
expertise to try to break into computer systems.
        "I have spoken with the three, who are in high school, and 
explained that what they are trying to do is wrong and has serious 
ramifications punishable by law." says Macone "I told them that they are 
right on the edge. Iis as if they are walking around a building and 
trying to break in."
 
        Anyone charged with making annoying phone calls, a misdemeanor, 
can receive a fine of up to $500 an up to 90 days in jail. Police say 
someone who breaches a computer system can be charged with a variety of 
misdemeanors and felonies, from malicious destruction to larceny, 
depending on information gleaned and how that information is used. 
        The inspector says he is not sure how many juveniles are 
involved, but he suspects they range in age from elementary school 
students to th high school level. In addition he says the numbers could 
have been given out to any number of other computer hackers in the 
Greater Boston area.
        "There are clubs of these hackers who meet regularly throughout 
the state and exchange modem numbers so they can practice. Because of the 
information we have, we believe there is as unknown larger group with the 
concord numbers."
        Maura Roberts, who teaches a computer workshop as Concord 
Carlisle High School, says hacking is a challenge for many students.
        "Kids today start it [learning how to use computers] so young and 
they are more sophisticated in their approach to computers because they 
have no fear. It becomes a challenge to find out what else they can do 
with it."
        Roberts speculates younger children probably do not realize 
trying to break into other systems is wrong, but look at it as a game.
        "For older kids, part of the challenge may be that it is wrong."

Red Box Planzz (d00d, they're s0 3l!t3)
        by Shredder

        That's a joke, by the way. Red boxes are extremely easy to build and use
following the below procedure. They work by duplicating the tones coins
make when they are deposited into a payphone. Be aware it is extremely
easy to foil red-boxers by placing a "notch filter" into the phone which
blocks out red-box tones. Basically, when the telco works on a phone,
they place a notch filter into it. Boxing is a dying art.
Pretty much everyone has a red box, but just so those of you who don't
stop asking, here they are. Instructions are given on how to make both
a red box, and a combo box, which lets you still use the tone dialer to
make DTMF (touchtone) tones.

Parts List:
----------
Thin insulated wire (if you want to make a combo box) 
DPDT Switch (if you want to make a combo box)
Timing Crystal 
        (somewhere close to 6.490 mHz. The tried and tested value
        is 6.5536 mHz. Radio Shack will special order 6.5536
        crystals for you for a PRICE. Also, you can buy 6.500 mHz
        crystals from DigiKey (800-344-4539) for $1.73 (Part number: X415)
33-Memory Toner Dialer
        Available in most Radio Shacks. Make sure you get the MEMORY one.
        Model number: 43-141

Instructions
------------
        1. Take your tone dialer and turn it over so the speaker is on top.
           Take off the battery compartment cover and remove the 4 screws.
        
        2. Remove the back cover of the tone dialer, being careful not to
           break the wires that connect the circuitry to the speaker.

        3. Look at the circuitry, you will see a small grey cylinder
           marked 3.579. This is the original tone dialer crystal. 
           Desolder this. If you are just making a red box, solder the two 
           leads of the 6.5X crystal to the contacts where the 3.579 crystal 
           was. For a combo box, skip to 5.

        4. Close the tone dialer and replace the screws. Voila.

        5. A combo box is slightly more complicated, but not much.
           Instead of soldering the 6.5X crystal directly to the contacts,
           solder each of the two leads to one set of poles on the DPDT 
           switch, but NOT the middle. Solder the original 3.579 tone
           dialer crystal to the other set of poles, again NOT the middle.
           Solder a piece of wire to each of the middle poles. The completed
           switch should look something like this:

                                -----
                                |   |            (Each || has two poles)
                         ===================
                         |                 |
                         ===================
                         ||       ||     ||
                         ||       ||     ||
                        3.579     two     6.5X crystal
                        crystal   wires

          6. Now connect the two wires to each of the terminals where the
             3.579 crystal was originally connected. Glue/tape/whatever
             the switch (and crystals if you want) to the outside of the
             tone dialer with epoxy. You may be able to fit the crystals
             inside the dialer case. It also helps to thread the wires
             through the holes in the back of the tone dialer. Close it up
             and voila.

        Using the Red Box
        ------------------
        On the combo box, the switch switches between crystals. If you can't
        figure it out from your wiring, the 6.5X crystal makes the higher
        pitched tones. (duh.) Place 5 *'s in P1 (or any other memory
        location). Using the 6.5 X crystal, that simulates the tones a
        quarter makes when it's dropped in the phone. There you go.
        Red boxing local calls requires a little more work, you can't just
        beep the tones. You need to start it off with a real coin, or go
        through an access number. (10ATT has been mentioned in this respect)
        Whoopee. Now you too have a red box, just like everyone else.

Fake Feds call the Temple of Stan
        by Shredder

        (In case you don't know, The Temple of Stan is my BBS, see the end
         of this file for the number, etc.)

         It all began on Saturday, April 18th. It was around 9:00 and
I'd just got up, and went downstairs to check my email and read the new 
messages on the Temple. Just my luck, someone had just logged in. It was a 
new user, and as usual, I watched to see what they would do. I was surprised 
and also a little shocked when they logged in and left me some feedback, an 
exact copy of which follows:

        To: system

        This is federal officer Daniel T Edmunds. Your BBS has been reported 
as spreading information about Phone fraud, Credit card fraud, computer 
breaking and entering, and many other crimes. Rather than seize your 
system, I am merely requesting that you cease all such activity 
forthwith. We have a user on line currently who will verify this for us.
If this does not occur within 7 days, we will take full legal action.
        We realize that you are probably engaged in what you consider to 
be "fun". This is not fun. This is against the law. Failure to comply may 
result in your arrest, confiscation of your hardware and any related 
software, and if needed the arrest of any and all users deemed to be 
participating in such activities.
                        Officer Daniel T. Edmunds.

        Hm. Quite. They also left a phone number. So, the first thing I did
was to call up ATDT and leave a message their asking what the hell to do.
A few hours later, Magic Man wrote back, he had talked to Count Zero, and
they thought it was probably a fake. They suggested trying the number he 
left. Then, i dialed up my Internet account, and mailed a message to the
EFF about what had happened. Interestingly enough, they still haven't
responded. I also received mail from Rogue Agent, giving me the names of two
other people to contact, if my fears turned out to be valid. I called the
number he left, it gave a tone and then hung up. I called New England 
Telephone and got them to call it. "Nope, it's not a personal telephone
number". Sounded like a test number to me, but they wouldn't tell me if
it was or not. 
        Next day. Sunday. I call the FBI in Boston. The easiest way to tell
if this guy is a fake or not, I thought, is to ask the FBI. So, the Boston
FBI tell me there's no Daniel T. Edmunds in the Boston Office, and to try
FBI Headquarters. So, I call FBI Headquarters, they tell me there's no FBI
agent anywhere with that name, that impersonating a Federal Agent is a
Federal offence, and to call the Boston Feds back. So, I do, they tell
me to call back the next day (Monday) and talk to the fraud squad.
        Monday. I talk to the fraud squad, they take all the details and
tell me they'll call me back.
        Thursday, April 22nd. The Feds called at 9:00 AM, waking me up.
The guy who called, Ed Clarke, seems quite nice, actually. He tells me
there is DEFINITELY no FBI agent under that name, but that they're not 
going to start some huge investigation. I agree, it's kind of a little
thing, especially with the whole Waco thing. But, he adds, the normal
procedure is to track down the person and warn them face to face that
it's illegal. Which would have the desired effect for me, to warn them that
they can't fuck with my board like that. So, it's left that if he ever
gets in contact with me again, to call them, and that they're putting his
name in their files, in case he pops up again. So, if someone using the
name Daniel T. Edmunds calls your board and tries something like this,
mail shredder@tacobel.UUCP and let me know.

Telecom News
        by TBS

The following press release was taken from Computer Underground Digest 5.28.


                         THE WHITE HOUSE

                  Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.

A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the
"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                2


"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper court or other legal
          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



                                3

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone
system transmits voice.

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.
The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE

Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.

Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?

A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.

Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a
     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper
     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products.

DESCRIPTION:

Last August, Texas A&M University UNIX computers came under extensive
attack from a coordinated group of internet crackers.  This package of 
security tools represents the results of over seven months of development
and testing of the software we have been using to protect our estimated
twelve thousand internet connected devices.  This package includes
three coordinated sets of tools: "drawbridge", an exceptionally powerful
bridging filter package; "tiger", a set of convenient yet thorough
machine checking programs; and "netlog", a set of intrusion detection
network monitoring programs.  While these programs have undergone
extensive testing and modification in use here, we consider this to
be a beta test release, as they have not had external review, and
the documentation is still very preliminary.

The world awaits the new HP Palmtop. The 100-LX. Should be out in 2-3
more weeks. Features include: 80 X 25 screen, 1 PCMCIA v2.0 slot, DOS 5.0
in ROM, all the stuff from the 95LX, plus links to Lotus cc:Mail wireless
mail. 1 MB RAM standard. Whoopee. Get this and a pocket modem and it's
pretty much a hacker/phreaker's best friend. Lists for $750, but will
probably be offered for less, as the 95LX was.
