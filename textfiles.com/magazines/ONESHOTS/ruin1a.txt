A Birth of a Group
By Seldomseen

	Well just another group to add to the already 500  plus on the scene.  Your wondering, or at least were waiting, I imagine, for us to boast how great we are, like a bunch of adolescent (acting at least), insecure, pseudo-educated persons, that think PC still stands for personal computer in the 90's. So why are we starting another group on the scene, like there aren't already plenty raving about how great their group is, when they've done absolutely nothing accept be a pain in the ass, whether as individual's or as entire groups.  That is one of the major reasons for us forming this group.  To clean the scene.  Attempting to expose those that are jeopardizing the scene.  Putting, unworkable warez out just for first out recognition.  Faker's, and virus injector's.  Stool's and fool's, and not just lamerz but leeching junkies that tie up the lines.
	 So who are we.  As the title of this article points out I'm Seldomseen, editor, CEO of RUIN, Co-sys of  The Abyss, and Sysop of, the soon to be, Abyss II.  Outlaw, Sysop of The Abyss, co-sys of Abyss II, and RUIN's Major of event's.  Darklord, monitor and developer of both The Abyss and Abyss II -- makin and bringing us PPE's so we don't have to, and library coordinator -- makin sure that The Abyss is current with software related to recreation,  and Abyss II towards business oriented software.  Alinsky, not as in Saul D. author of Rules for Radical's, obviously an alias, but just as good a writer, and a better researcher in my opinion.  A person known by many but never by the same alias and definitely not this one.  With the proper info Alinsky can verify any person on the scene's identity. He modestly tells of being on roughly 75 to 100 underground boards in any given month, usually running scripts, and through the nets to keep himself active. 
	This may seem deceiving and underhanded in the eyes of the elite, but it is to be a blessing to them.  With approximately 1700 underground boards roaming our nation the elite should be considered a exclusive minority safe from those that are trying to ruin it either by informing the one's we evade; by being leech junkies, or just infecting our boards with their drool.  That's the main purpose of RUIN, to expose those user's and sysops that are only inhibiting and endangering the scene.  In each issue we'll inform all that care to read about these individual's.  Of-course we will give each of those we expose a chance to redeem and defend themselves in the issue preceding the one we crucify them in.  We'll try also to present other useful info, with a more positive meaning and influence.  In some cases we will just reprint the text philes we obtain giving credit totally to the user that has written them, with the exception that we will change spacing, font and size, format, and spell correct when we now the correct spelling.
	However, without the users of the scene we won't be able to make this zine, or RUIN work to all our benefit.  All of us at RUIN hope you find this premiere issue interesting enough to look forward to the next.  
	So now to the crucifixion's of those that deserve it.

Belated Couriers or Just One Person's Cover to Leech?
By Seldomseen

This is of a personal nature to those of us at RUIN, and The Abyss, and cannot be justified by the Sysop's or the group, which in this case is one of the same.
	Belated Couriers is a board in 206, and has been running for less then six month's.  Its Sysop is Panda, and is not known to be using any other alias's.  His activity has only been traced through a few boards in 206, including.  The Abyss, however, it is very apparent what Panada has been up to, do to his limited connections.  Last week he was disgruntled and alarmed by Outlaws comments about not wanting to be any part of Belated Couriers and discussed that with me stating that the philosophy of the Sysop's of the scene was that each provides other Sysop's with leech access and that he would like to see this philosophy upheld.  That the scene was a brotherhood and he didn't want to see it trashed like this by Outlaw stating that about Belated.  Not knowing Panada that well I asked Outlaw about why he left that message.  Apparently, in a few days time Panda had DL over 80 megs of warez from The Abyss, which is a local call and then put them on his board as ULed by Belated Couriers.  Deleting the info about being leeched from the Abyss and The Abyss's top Uler George from The Firm in 908 and has spent much time and money to have the prestige as being the top Uler.  Not to mention RENing the file name so not to be able to distinguish it as a FRM warez.  Even this evening he was busy DL over 10 megs from Scared Ground, 206, another local call.  It seems all his leeching is done locally.  However, none have seen him couriering anywhere.  Now is this because Panda is relatively new to the scene not to mention as being a Sysop?  Or could it be that Belated Couriers BBS is an excuse for Panda to try to get people to provide him with warez first and running a BBS second, third, or even fourth?  I could see this with a younger teenager new to the scene, but Panda is a working man, old enough to have common sense about how things work on the scene, and though many Sysop's do provide leech access to other Sysop's, an courier's they do hope to see their generosity reciprocated in some fashion.  Lastly I think we all know that couriering groups are a very big part of keeping the scene alive, but a couriering group that only jockeys to their own site?  Come on.  As far as we know it's only Panda and a couple others that we haven't seen couriering anywhere. LEECHER'S!  You decide.

Subway Bomber Linked to Board's Underground
By Alinsky

	As everyone I imagine knows in 908, 201 area's and across the nation, December 21, 1994 marked another terrorist attack on our country, by a deranged citizen of our country, on innocent American's.  Destroying the lives of many people that had never done anything to deserve the pains inflicted on them or their families.  
	For those that didn't  pull themselves way from their terminals during the week of the 21st.  That was the day of the New York City subway bombing.  When I saw the report and they explained the type of bomb it was, described the suspect, Leary, as a recently unemployed Merell Lnych computer operator, and a bit loose in the head, I knew right away, probably like many of you, that the information had to have come from a underground BBS, but left it at that.  Then when I was accessing a board a few hundred miles SE of the 908 area I obtained a phile written by Little Bit of YMSM.  Below is the exact text phile he sent out and it has proceeded to make it to many other board's I've accessed.  (Take note of that Panda it was a fine example of true couriering):

YMSM EMERGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT!
The ElYtE Guardians of 908
By LittlE biT/YMSM

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL SYSOPS PERTAINING TO ANARCHY FILES
----------------------------------------------------------
Police and FBI investigating accused subway Bomber PC for suspected computer files on how to manufacture gelatin bombs.  You have probably heard about the fruitcake that fried himself and critically injured himself in a bombing on the NYC subway, right?  Here's what the Media reported: Did you know that the police and FBI searched his house for books and COMPUTER FILES? Computer files you say, YEP, you know the type that you see on BBSes on how to manufacture gelatin type bombs, those anarchy type files.
Did you also know that this dude was a computer programmer by living?  Well he was.  Did you know he also lived in Scotch Plains (908) area code? 
Here's what I know about the dude:
==================================
For over a year off and on I have been chatting acquaintances with a dude that was heavy into mythology.  I ran into him on the Coliseum where he was using a handle 'THOR'. He and I used to bump into each other on Traders and TUGO.  Since you almost never give yer real name out to anyone, I never really knew his real name.  One day after a 20 minute chat I suggested he give me a call voice, and stupidly gave out my number. After taking to the guy for almost 2 hours I knew he wasn't screwed on straight.  This dude was into head games. He claimed he could get on any board with leech access by using a handle of a well known user. He often used the handle 'WOLFRIC' to get on smaller boards that he knew the real Wolfric  wouldn't call or would use him as a reference knowing that these sysops never check their user references out.
Today I got the fright of my life.  I was called by the Scotch Plains Police who were going through this dude's PC dialing directory. The officer was very interested in how I knew him, and maybe most importantly what I knew about text files on explosives. It wasn't until I got off the phone that
I realized that these 2 guys were one and the same. Christ!
-----------------------------------------
Here's all I can remember about the dude:
-----------------------------------------
He'd call using well known user handles or would use them as refs.  He was pretty much local 908 and considered 201 to be local.  He told he could only call boards a couple of times a week, so he couldn't be anyone who calls more than that.  He was into the underground files. i don't remember anything about bombs, but he was really interested in hacking files.  Dunno, maybe that's where he started reading about bombs.  I am pretty sure he was on TUGO, Traders Alliance, Rebel Alliance, and Necronomicum, but was months ago.
IF YOU HAVE ANY FILES ON ANARCHY TYPE SUBJECTS AND YOU ARE RUNNING A BBS
IN 908 YOU ARE IN BIGTIME RISK.  YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR BOARD DOWN IMMEDIATELY!

				LittlE biT
				YMSM

	O.K.  helpful text for any that are in those area's.  However, any board with anarchy type philes would never be at risk thanks to our wonderful first amendment, but if they have warez and/or asking for contribution's or donation's and the cop's logon you should know that your wake-up call the next morning is basically going to suck.  It won't be the cop's.  Instead it will be those ultra right wing boy's in gray.
	Well, Leary should hang for blownin that bomb, no question about it and if anyone has any information pertaining to him being on their board, being a user on any board or knew the name of his board, which I know he had, should contact the NYC transit detectives.  They don't want to bust any board's all the cop's want to do is prove how this cat obtained the information to make the bomb, however, if they have to go lookin for it they'll be bustin board's and the Fed's will be involved then.  They know more then you think.  I'm sorry I can't say more but it would be considered to be interfering with a federal investigation.  Even though we live on the scene by aliases they could obtain my real name, and physical address faster then I can yours.  
	So what does Little Bits have to do with any of this?  Well basically everything he says above is true except, "Today I got the fright of my life.  I was called by the Scotch Plains Police who were going through this dude's PC dialing directory. The officer was very interested in how I knew him, and maybe most importantly what I knew about text files on explosives. It wasn't until I got off the phone that
I realized that these 2 guys were one and the same. Christ!"  	First, the Scotch Plain Police are not even involved with the case and refereed J.M.'s name, Little Bits real name initials, to NYC transit detectives who are handling the case.  Second, and the reason for writing this crucifixion.  The police did not contact Little Bit, he contacted them.  I know this info because I recently have written an article that may be published in the next few month's on how some of the text found on the scene can be hazardous to your health.  And let me a sure you it's not because I'm a cop, fed, or working with any agency or company related to bustin board's.  Although the idea of some twelve year old blowin himself up, or some wacko injuring my family or friend's with such a device really strikes a nerve.  If these philes are ever truly be used then let it be in the name of revenge and only against those that caused harm to them.

Big Board's, Fed Board's?
By Seldomseen

	How many have wondered how certain elite boards can get so big without having any sign's of getting busted or any worry of being legally fucked?  It's always a paranoia of mine.  The phile below I received in the 404 area.  I was only able to get on Inferno.  However, I was able to have a brief chat with Striker who defended himself by saying he trades over 200 c.c's a day and abruptly hung-up on me.  Never disclosing if he was a fed or not.  Below is the phile in its entirety:

This file consists of two lamers who are in the scene.  These two guys are local losers from the 718 area code.  These guys attempt to hack board, threaten people, and format people's drives.  From last I heard, these guys have been found working for the police.  Beware of these guys.  Association with these guys can be costly for your health.  They will try to befriend you and then they will report you to their superiors.  The best thing to do in this situation would be to harass these guys as much as possible.  If you harass them, they will leave the scene and never come back.  Well here are the guyz info:  ENJOY!

A Concerned BBS'er

	Striker is currently the prez of RAZOR, and his board, I believe, is their WHQ.  It would be unfortunate if this phile speaks the truth.  RAZOR is one of the largest and one of the most respected groups on the scene.  They have contributed much to the scene.  If this is true it should make everyone a little more cautious of their affiliation's.  RUIN tends to believe, though, that the "Concerned BBS'er" is someone who pissed these folks off, and they deleted them from their boards or is pissed at them for some other reason.  	You decide and let us know if you have anything pertaining to this text so we can clear this up for the scene. 
	This news is fairly old, but we feel worth bring up to let all know the truth.  We are not even sure of the total truth at this time, and still researching some of the people and board's involved. 
	It starts in sometime around May of 94.  Predatory Nature, 360, operated by The Foreman, was well on its way to becoming one of the best on the scene.  It was the WHQ for GOD, and ISA and was workin 0 day warez.  Now the board is strictly ISA.  The Sysop worked hard to make it a friendly place while keeping the law and order of a board working its way to the top.
	This is were it gets confusing from text I've received.  Below is a capture, although its meaning and purpose is sketchy I reprint it below so that anyone with any info about the user The Foreman is chatting with can be identified, and to find out exactly what this has to do with the bust or potential bust, and who sent it out around the scene in the east and west:

ATOMIC
-=> Review Krew <=-
 
This is the cropped chat capture with the Foreman of Predatory Nature the day before his board got busted. Notice that he talked about the bust threats and how he nuked his drives, making the board ISA only. This is for all you freaks who are spreading lies about how Foreman took down the boards in 206 like Mooncrow's. Here's the truth:

ok. here is the new nup, effective right after you log off: iSA Rocks!
ok got it.. do I gota reapply then for access?
nope, you got it now..  and you want in the group correct?
yep.
ok hold  ok take a look

thanx
no prob.. conf 9 is ours, and basically this is a isa only bbs now..  ALL
files have been nuked due to a bust threat, but I am 0-3, and have one of the
fastest console boards around.. same with Amiga.. not that anything is here
now  :(

hehehe... ok, gotcha.. am I up to my self to make stuff or will there be
certain stuff asked of me to make?
 both actually, if you have an idea, go ahead and either make it, or talk it
over with me.. and I have some projects that would be nice to release.

ok cool... it'll probably take me a week or so to totally get used to the PCE
stuff but if you need any PCB or DOS programs then I can do those asap... ok?
ok..  one thing that I really want is a program to extract the diz files from
LHA and LZH files, for both DOS, and uploads to PCE boards.

ok that shouldn't be to hard I have the LZh source and also a PCE pasca
toolkit so that'll be easy.. heh.
ok,   the one for dos should be able to sort by date, and add all files in a
directory, of course checking to see if it is allready in the DIR?.TXT file

the only problem here with me is that I run PcBoard and am totally unfamiliar
with PCE's external file storage for like directory listings and the like.
it is similar actually  like this

NEWFILE.ZIP P 940326
 DIZ DESCRIPTION
 GOES 1 COLUMN IN,
 AND DOWN AS MANY AS 13 LINES. AND 45 ACCROSS
ok... the filename, passed char, and filesize are all separated by one space
on one line?
the file size is not in the DIR?.TXT, the bbs adds it..  only the descriptor
(either F=Free  P= passed or E= error in file)
ok gotcha.. sounds fairly easy.. do you know where I might be able to get a
dir list to test the program on?
just get the bbs, or take dizmast from conf 5
ok cool... gota run.. I'll talk to you later...
ok man..  thanks alot, I think this is a good partnership.. :)
definetly... sounds good... ok I'll work on some stuff... ok later..
.later man..
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decide for yourself.
Long live The Foreman.

	This capture could be vital in finding out the truth, or it may just be nonsense with no purpose.
	If your on Predatory Nature asking question's your told it was two user's that busted him.  The Sysop of Defcon 5, 206, Missleman, and the ex-Sysop of Future Shock, 206,  The Prophecy.  Although, when asking The Foreman he never points the figure at The Prophecy.  This may be because that The Prophecy was The Foreman's mentor and helped him quite a lot getting his board up.  At least that's the way The Prophecy told the story to me over a year ago.  It should be mentioned here also that Future Shock, The Prophecy's board was apparently almost busted too.  This would explain why he may have ratted on The Foreman.  
	Missleman is another case.  The Foreman freely admits that it was him that almost or did get him busted.  Why Missleman would do this can only be concluded as out of jealousy, for the fact that  Defcon 5 had been on the 206/360 scene longer and wasn't having the same growth potential as Predatory Nature.  This could be caused by his attitude no doubt, which is disliked by many in the 206/360 scene.  Or that he is truly a fed informant.  When you ask The Foreman to give up what he knows of Missleman he decline's not wanting to cause anymore problem's.  Or is that really the reason?
	Several user's on the scene have disclosed that they know or believe it to be true that The Foreman did get busted and instead of doing time, or paying ridiculous fines he decided to become a fed board. 
	I find this hard to believe, maybe only because I don't want to believe it.  The Foreman has always been helpful and fair with every user on his board, and has always takin the time to resolve problems and answer question's.  If it is true, however, that would mean that another board dedicated to a prestigious group is out to cripple the scene.

Bust Info on  514
By:  Electronic BottleNeck  (PHZ)

Saturday morning the 14ht 1995. Remember BOOSTER from you know where, has
been busted by BELL MOBILITY. The reasons of this bust are:
1- Fraud using cellular phones, during 2300  at 34c/Min
2- Also using stuff to call toronto (PBX'S)
Total:  75,000 $  of damages requested by Bell Mobility.
        Saturday morning, 2 cops from Laval police and 2 inspectors knocked
at BOOSTER'S door. There were also a security investigator from BELL MOBILITY
with them. They entered in with a warrant and ask for Carl (BOOSTER). They took
everything. 1 machine with more than 500 Megz of 0-4 dayz warez, 3000 megs of
backuped software and probably a cell. phone. They arrested him, and they went
to the Bureau of Investihgation of Laval where he had an interrogation. BOOSTER
called up a lawyer.
        BOOSTER was using a hacked cellular phone with the same SIDH for
a month. So they decided to track him up, and by triangulation, they went
where the call were made. They've waited about a month before busting, making
a big bill to BOOSTER. His line was tapped for a whole week and his in and outs
were supervised.
        Also, It's confirmed that THE ADEPT another guy of the gagn had the
visit of the investigators, but they were unlucky, THE ADEPT was far home.
Maybe the will get him soon!
                               ----------
        Situation like these are not very appreciated, but it's part of the
        game...   last words   GAME OVER BOOSTER!
   *** SYSOPS : Message from BOOSTER: Nuke our acces everywhere because
                           THE ADEPT: phonebooks were also busted.

"Court's computer porn ruling sets dangerous precedent"
By Keith Ammann
The Evansville Press, Dec. 15, 1994

	In some ways, the information highway is more like an information ocean.  Powerful currents stir within, evidenced only by ripples on the surface.
	One ripple appeared in the pages of The Evansville Press on Dec. 3, in the form of a short article with the headline, "California couple sentenced to prison by Tennessee court."
	This article was the only publicly visible evidence of a conflict that has	been raging for months on the Internet, to which local residents -- save	for a few college students, professors and users of commercial on-line services -- are unlikely to have had any access at all.
	Robert and Carleen Thomas of Milpitas, Calif., a city of 38,000 near the southernmost inlet of San Francisco Bay, ran a computer bulletin board	 service called Amateur Action BBS. AA BBS was devoted to aficionados of --let's not mince words -- pornography. It provided an assortment of X-rated stories and pictures for users to download (copy onto their own computer disks). As with any bulletin board service, any person could register himself with the system operators and access the system, using a modem,
from any telephone connection.  ANY telephone connection. Anywhere, from Alaska to Zimbabwe.
	Seems a certain postal inspector decided to advance his career a bit.  David Dirmeyer, using the pseudonym "Lance White," registered as an AA BBS user and set about trying to nab the Thomases on obscenity charges, using such questionable methods as mailing them unsolicited videotapes containing
child pornography (where Dirmeyer got the tapes himself was not a matter of record).  Finally he found a charge that he could make stick. Accessing AA BBS from a computer in Memphis, Tenn., he downloaded material from the Milpitas system and pressed charges: transmitting obscenity via interstate telephone lines.
	Obscenity law is infamous for being vague in terms of what it prohibits, invariably falling back on the concept of "community standards." That is, if something of a prurient nature violates the sensibilities of the general population of a locale, it is -- at least in that place -- obscene.  Suffice it to say that Milpitas and Memphis have very different "community standards."
	The Thomases were in California during the time their supposed malfeasance took place, and their computer never left California.  But pornographic material had indisputably gotten from their system to
Tennessee, where it violated "community standards" -- so the Thomases were tried there instead.  The Thomases did not control when and how their files were sent out.  Dirmeyer, from a computer in Memphis, had ordered the AA BBS computer to send him pornographic material, and the computer, following its
preprogrammed instructions, did so automatically.
	One would think that by causing the information to be sent, Dirmeyer, not the Thomases, would be guilty of transmitting obscene materials. The federal court in Tennessee in which the Thomases were tried would not --and did not -- agree. The Thomases were both found guilty and sentenced to
prison.
	The problem with the case against AA BBS does not lie in obscenity law,
which has its own menagerie of difficulties.  The problem is in the precedent: People in California can be forced to adhere to Tennessee's "community standards."  For that matter, people ANYWHERE can be forced to adhere to ANY other community's standards -- and by necessity, the standards to which all must
adhere will be the most restrictive ones in existence.
	Our modern telecommunications network, including phones, cable television,
satellite transmissions and computer lines, has grown to where it defies any attempts to place geographical boundaries upon it. Information --including that which is obscene to some -- can be sent instantaneously
from one legal juristiction to another without requiring the hand of any living person at its point of origin to direct it to its destination.  Thus, under this precedent, a person setting up a pornographic bulletin
board service in one state, though he is subject to no criminal penalty where he resides, CANNOT PREVENT HIMSELF FROM COMMITTING A CRIME IN ANOTHER STATE if someone there chooses to use the service he provides. He need never enter that state or even initiate contact with it.  Frighteningly, the ruling's power extends beyond the borders of the United States.  The operator of a pornographic bulletin board in, say, Sweden could unwittingly violate the law if Dirmeyer decided to download its contents to
a computer in Memphis. Our Swedish friend might never even have heard of Tennessee, let alone know that, by the innocent act of attaching his system to a telephone or network line, he was making it possible for someone in the United States to turn him into an international criminal with the press
of a button.
	On-line computer users have sarcastically suggested that all telephone, computer and cable lines into Tennessee be cut, thus freeing purveyors of erotic material from the risk that a Tennesseean might accept some, causing them to violate federal law.  Such a suggestion is obviously absurd, but what else is to be done? Clearly this is ridiculous, untenable ruling must be struck down.
	The Thomases, with help from on-line civil liberties groups, will undoubtedly appeal. Let us hope that higher courts understand that neither Tennessee nor any other place can be the moral arbiter of the entire global village.



Updated Elite Acronym List, Defintions and Contact Area's Desired

	Below you will find a list that deserves much credit from a group on the scene.  Unfortunately when I obtained the phile there was no one that took credit or at least in the copy I have.  My only contribution to this list is a few correction's, and the addition of the group's with the star's; which I deire definition's for.  If you belong to any of the starred group's, or a group that is not mentioned here please UL that information, with the info asked below, if known, to The Abyss, NUP:  Abyss, 206-581-7905, to Seldomseen.  My intention's are to update the list with board's to apply, a list of active member's and their position's.   Configure them into a database to be found in one of RUIN future issues.  Any advice, tips, or help that anyone would want to provide be appreciated.

Phiber Optik is Free!

	After 10 month's in a minium security prison Phiber Optik is free.  His friends threw him a party in a NYC night club, which made him into a small media star.  He will be working for ECHO BBS in NY as a tech guru and under the alias Phiber.  Does this mean crime does pay after sittin on your ass for a few month's?  Good to have you out Phiber.  Write a book my friend you deserve it.  The goatee add's age and wisdom to this 22 year-old computer guru.  LOD would have been nothin without him and Im sure the Wired article didn't give him enough credit.  Peace to you Phiber if you get a chance to read this, and if you have leave me mail at The Abyss, sure like to hear what you think of the books and shit they've put out that have tried to surround your life.  Lookin awlful GQ for a computer jock.  Bring the look out to the MS (Micro Soft)  state, the women are natural and fine, nothin like that crack house, smog filled, thing they like to call the big apple. Were you could butter the body with the make-up on a women's face.  Lot's of good computer related business and jobs out here.  That would snap you up.  

Watching the Sun Rise...It's Time to Say Good-bye

	Well thats it.  Hopefully a beginging to the end of the loserz, leecherz, and lamerz of the scene.  A begining to the cleaning of the scene and RUIN.  In this zip you'll also find a Terminate phone book consisting of 500 number's I've been compiling many of them over the last two year's, obviously I can't gaurantte that all of them are still up.  I have over 700 more to add, but the maxium for the phone book is 500.  I would like to be able to input them all in one phone book.  If anyone can help me figure this out or provide me with a phone book for terminate that will allow many more numbers to be typed in please UL it to The Abyss, 206-581-7905, NUP: Abyss.  Ultimately I would like to have every board in our nation available in it, but again that can only be accomplished by the help of all you on the scene.  Understandably some Sysop's would prefer their boards not to be listed.  Let me know by leaving e-mail at The Abyss and I will make sure thats changed for the next release and I apologize in advance, it wasn't intentional.
	 The Abyss would like to be considered for any distribution sites available.  Our goal is to be a 0-30 day warez in the next few month's, and will be increasing our hd space and nodes according to increase in membership and interests.   Were also looking for couriers, writers, and anyone that has a way of providing valuable info about the scene and the user's that deserve recognition or cruxcifixion.  If your interested log on to The Abyss, 206-581-7905, NUP: abyss, Alais: RUIN, Pass: RUIN.
	The 206/360 scene has never really been at the top of the list as an Elite area.  We would like it if we could change that.  Were small now, but, "...the future so bright we've got to wear shades."  (or somethin like that.) Were just a bunch of family guys who don't have a life after work and spend our weekends with our radioactive buddies and smokin diskettes.
	I would be interested in hearing from any zines, or groups similiar to ours that would be interested in combining forces, or that have any suggestions for us.  I especially like to know what the guys from ILL think.  I like what Ive seen ya'all pump out.
	In closing I like to say that we are not out to start any war's with any individual or group's that we write about.  We're just here to research and write about the information that is provided to us by other's who respect and want to keep the scene clean.  Once again, we welcome any rebuttals in defense of those put on the block.  If any of those individual's or groups we discuss here do desire to start a war with us.  Step back and think about it.  Do you really think that we would not prepare ourselves for such attacks prior to writing or reprinting info about you?  Don't be stupid!  We don't print everything we know about you, and expecting you to do something is petty compared to what we'll have no choice but to do back.  Our information is only as accurate as it is provided to us and even though we're small and lookin for more member's, we spend as much time possible researching and social engineering to make sure it's correct.
	Peace for now to all on the scene -- Do onto others only what you would do to yourself --Take care, and keep eyes in the back of your head,
