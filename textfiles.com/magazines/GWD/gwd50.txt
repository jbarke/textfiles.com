Yes and no...  You can baste an old stringy Chihuahua in Shiner Bock for a
while to make it juicy, and it'll taste about the same as a new chihuahua 
puppy.

Well, the breed _does_ play a part in the taste, but a major part is going to 
be what you feed it.  If you just grab Joe Blow's mutt who's been fed Gravy 
train all it's life, you're going to get a dog that tastes like dog food.  
However, if you go and feed that dog chickens, fresh game, and other wholesome
carnivorous type meals, you're going to get a meaty, well blended meal.

Well, I would think that season would play as much a part as anything. For 
instance: you would probably filet portions of the larger breeds and bar-b-que
them during the warm months. The smaller, or 'toy' breeds would make better 
'fryers', etc.

But during the cold months, I tend to get away from eating dogs altogether, 
and tend to crave baby humans more.

good idea...and the larger breeds would make good jerky as well, which, In my 
opinion, jerky is the best thing to take with you when it's dog season, and 
your stuck in a dog blind in some alley, and it's like 30 degrees, little bit 
of a wind, and your just cold as fuck, and you need something to chew on.

I can tell you that white wine goes better with smaller dogs, and red with 
bigger. Chihooahooas are really nice braised in a nice white wine and swiss 
cheese sauce, whereas the St. Barnard is best roasted whole over a spit and 
covered with brandy and flamed.

I rather enjoy a nice grilled teenager, served with baby potatoes and those 
lil bitty ears of corn. The rampant hormones just add something to the 
flavoring that makes 'em Mmm-Mmm Good. 

Another favorite around the Longshot household is deep-fried cockroaches. Just
gather 'em up and pop in the Fry Daddy for a yummy snack during movies...no 
batter needed. Remember to spit out the shells, though. They can get stuck in 
your teeth and it takes needle-nose pliers to get 'em out.

Part A:  The Texas Lottery

    This is a silly writing assignment I had to do for my computer science class
last year at school.  I hope you like it.  If you don't sense the abounding
sarcasm, you live in the toilet.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Mr. Bush,

	You, as the governor, should know many people's opinions regarding 
many issues.  For instance, you must know what all of us Fundamentalist 
Christians think regarding the lottery, because we're better than everyone 
else.  The Texas Lottery is an issue that has many pros and cons, mostly cons.
	The lottery has a few pros.  One of these is that winners can donate 
some of their winnings to the Church tax-free.  Another is that since gamblers 
sin by gambling, they obviously sin in other ways as well, and we don't want 
sinners in the church.  The Lottery weeds out the sinners.  The Lottery also
benefits education.  This is good because with a great man like you in office, 
we will soon re-instate a good old fashioned Fundamentalist education for our 
children, and if Mr. Gingrich on Capitol Hill gets his way, some of the 
lottery money can be spent to hire a preacher to lead school prayer.  However, 
the lottery is not all that good of a thing.  
    The lottery is against God because of the gambling involved.  We all
know that gambling is a sin (except when the gambling is Bingo at Church).
God has punishments for gamblers, such as eternal damnation in hell.  Not only
are gamblers destined for eternal suffering, but they are spending their money 
on something besides church.  This should not be.  All money not spent on
housing, food, and clothing should be spent on the church. [In the original
draft it said "All money not spent on housing, food, clothing, and
prostitutes...", but I decided I was going a little too far for a good grade
anyway. -Lobo]  Gambling is evil,and any people caught buying tickets should be
rehabilitated, inquisition-style.  The Texas Lottery Commission should be
replaced with a group of us Fundamentalists.  Only then can we turn the lottery
toward the forces of good.
	The Texas Lottery is definitely something you should consider.  I'd 
like to say that my Church and I will support whichever decision you make.  
However, I cannot say this because I would be lying, and lying is a sin.  What 
I will say is that if you do not change the lottery to put us in charge of it 
or cancel it altogether, we will be forced to vote you out in four years.  I
cannot be held responsible for what a few of our more "unbalanced"
individuals might do to you and/or your family.  Change the lottery, Mr. Bush.
	The Texas Lottery has a few good points but many bad ones.  This 
should be changed, or bad things will happen to you.  I urge you to do what I 
say. 
					In the Name of the Lord,
					  Lobo "The God-Send"

Part B: E-mail to me.

    I have no idea who sent this (I can't remember, it's old), but I found it on
my drive and I still think it's funny.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Anarchy file is a file that tells you how to break into a house and rob it
and stuff. Thats not as useful to use as things like, "How to get free cokes 
out of a coke machines or free candy out of a vending machine. YOu are 
supposed to pour salt down the coin despencer and the machine will start 
pouring out change and cokes. Tells ya how to make great "REVENGE" things that 
were made in the "Viet Nam War" by the Viets. So about those GLs thats I told 
ya about, well I lied but I do have some great nude GIFs of Cindy Crawford and
things like that. Sorry to disappoint ya.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I do remember that that was in reply to my reply to his auto-message which
said something to the effect of "E-mail me if you have anarchy files, or if you
want to know what one is.  I also have great GL's and GIF's and stuff."  I
simply asked him to tell me what an anarchy file was (don't you love his
definition?  heheh).
________________________________________________________________________________
Part C:  Lame Board Stuff

    I AM NOT the person chatting.  I got this from an anonymous source that
wanted to piss the sysop of the board off.  All names (handles and boards) have
not been changed (except the references to the board this was on).  This is the
newuser login on a board that runs GAP, I believe.  In case you care.  Which you
don't.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What is your favorite color?
  A: Jimm's
Q: What is your shoe size?
  A: cool
Q: What is the capital of Assyria?
  A: new
Q: Do you engage in any sexual activities with farm animals?
  A: board
Q: Is your father a lesbian?
  A: fuck you
Q: Did you get that last question?
  A: woo

 Good, your not a worthless dependant of your parents after all.

Q: Do you ever feel that women laugh at your penis?
  A: fuck
Q: If you happen to be a woman, do you laugh at the size of mens' penises?
  A: always
Q: If my mom is reading this right now. . .would you let me off easy?
  A: suck my dick, girlie man.
Q: Are you thoroughly prepared for the enormousness of what you have just begun
   to emerse yourself in?
  A: super!
Q: In the next few lines, tell me about your person:
  A: i have a big hard dick
  A: i stroke it often.
  A: stroke me, please!
  A: well well well. poopoo buttsie.
  A: suck my dick.

 Are you ready?????????????  WELCOME!!!!!!

 P.S.
 If you stayed on-line through the previous questionnaire, then you must be
 insane enough to join.

<chat begins>
--=Hi, This Is Jimm SysOp=--

Jimm SysOp: what the fuck fo you want???

anony guy: Jimm's BBS will nail your ass to the wall every time.

Jimm SysOp: is this mr. aerik aeriksson

anony guy: nope, why would he get on under a bs handle?

Jimm SysOp: i don't know, but i remember writing that on a post somewhere

anony guy: PCI.  that's where it was and that's where i read it.  hee-haw!

Jimm SysOp: have we spoken before on posts???

anony guy: hmmm, i don't think so.  we call some of the same boards, and as near
           as i can tell, you're quite an ass.

Jimm SysOp: fuck you too, do you want on this board or are you going to start
            some shit??

anony guy: is a bbs really worth getting pissed over?  well, i guess i'll log
           off and maybe get on later with my real handle, but you'll never know
           who this really is, mr. cool.

Jimm SysOp: you can get on the board, but just don't fuck with me, you can do
            anything else though, and a BBS is worth getting pissed off about if
            you put months into setting it up

anony guy: well, shit.  'just don't fuck with me' ---- scary scary, don't we
           look mean?

<Jimm SysOp proceeds to hit the panic-button and knock anony guy off of the bbs>

Part D: Yearbook Stuff

    The following is the signature that Mr. Q put in my 1994 (Freshman)
yearbook.  I think it's damn funny.  I'm sorry if you don't.  Well, not really.
Granted, it's about half private jokes, but some of it's not and some of it's
funny even if you don't entirely get it.  Maybe.  Btw- Mr. Q really is Satan
[and is a member of the Keyblurr Elvz (maybe) and a GwD member.  We've got POWER
now!  Especially since The Lizard King is really God, and he's in GwD too.  Aww
yeah!  Heheheh.]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hey Lobo,
        It is my great hope that one day, all the oppressed frogs will rise up
    in glorious triumph and take over the world.  May you live each day of your
    life & find true happiness & a good woman.
                                SMOKING KILLS
                                  (Do Acid)
        Caw Caw!  Bang!  Fuck, I'm dead.
                                    Your Prince of Darkness,
                                    Your Lord of Evil,
                                         Mephistopheles
                                          A.K.A.
                                           Mr. Q
        P.S.  I DON'T RESPECT YOU!  You're not my father.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This next little bit is an "article" in the 1995 yearbook [my Sophomore
year] at my school.  It features a brief quote from Kilroy [another GwD member]
and is right next to a big picture of me "waiting for a ride" in the yearbook.
(If you want to see the picture, send an SASE to the GwD P.O. Box and I'll make
a copy of it and send it to you.  Not that you'd really want to see me, though.)
It's from the Generation-X page or something.  Yay.  It's by Tony White who was
the Senior Class President.  Woogie!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Life in the Gap
                                ---------------
A lack of unity and resentment towards Baby Boomers makes our generation less
like "Generation-X" and more like "Generation Why"
                                     *****
    Slackers.  Baby Busters.  Twenty-somethings.  These are all name used by the
popular media to describe America's thirteenth generation.  Our generation is
heir to a five trillion dollar debt created by our parents.  We are also facing
the worst job market in America since the end of World War II.  Thirteen has
always been an unlucky number.
    Our generation is marked by its diversity.  Senior Joy Johnson said,
"Everyone is so incredibly dissimilar, generalizations are impossible to make."
However, we do seem to share some common values.  Our generation is already used
to working for a living.  "I work thirty hours a week," said senior Amy Thomas,
"so that I won't have to take as much from my parents."  The idea of cleaning up
after our parents economic blunders provokes major attitude from many of us.
    Senior Ben Heavner [Kilroy] said our generation is "annoyed at the world"
and ready to "kick some yuppie tail" in the workplace.
    Everyone seemed to agree with sophomore Brian Melton's [a.k.a. Seamonkey and
something else I forgot, I don't know why I'm telling you this because he's not
in GwD] sentiments that baby boomers "screwed up a lot or stuff that they expect
us to fix."  Melton also said, "I don't like the words that my parents use.
When they say 'groovy' or 'hip', it really peeves me."
    Aside from our general disdain for baby boomers, very little unity is felt
by our generation.  As Johnson said, "a clearly defined dogma for our
generation does not exist."  The myriad of opportunity provided for us in the
late twentieth century has made us the most diverse generation in our country's
history.  Unlike our parents, we have no spokesmen, wars or movements to bring
us together.

PART E:  Ach!  (Pronounced "ock!")

    This is a silly little poem by me.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I rock.
I have a cock.
I own a sock.
I wear a smock.
My door has a lock.
It makes people knock.
I'm glad I'm not a jock.
I don't like people who mock.
I like food cooked in a wok.
I need to spell check this block.
The only good beer is Shiner Bock.
I don't live near a dock.
I have something I want to hock.
A girl at work has a pock.
God, I'm tired of this schlock.

PART F:  Drugs

Here's some handy info for you.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Pot-Grass
                                  Dope-Weed
                                  Roach-Joint
                                  MaryJane

                                  Crank--Dexies
                                  Coke--Rock
                                  Toot--Blow
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 What is Crack?
                                 --------------
Crack, sometimes call "rock", is the street name for a more refined, freebased,
form of cocaine that is smoked.  Crack can be five to six times stronger than
the cocaine normally purchased on the street.  It is believed that the drug is
named for the crackling noise it makes when smoked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Are amphetamines used for medical purposes?
                -------------------------------------------
Amphetamines are used for treating narcolepsy (a rare disorder marked by
uncontrolled sleep episodes) and minimal brain dysfunction (MBD) in children.
They also are prescribed for short-term treatment of obesity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            How Can You Tell If Someone You Know Is Using Crack?
            ----------------------------------------------------
An early sign of difficulty can be an abrupt breakdown in family communications
or change in a person's behavior.  A marked change in personality, a loss of
interest in personal appearance, paranoid behavior or animosity toward family
and friends may all be significant.

Other symptoms include restlessness, anxiety, an inability to concentrate,
marked agitation, weight loss and altered sleeping patterns.

These symptoms, where young people are concerned, may often be signs of
anxieties experienced during adolescence [Parents:  This means that there's no
way to tell if your kid is smoking crack or if he's just normal.], but if
illicit substances are involved they would probably be magnified.  Other danger
signals include associations with new friends known to use drugs, or unexplained
disappearances of money and valuables from the house.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        What are some of the immediate effects of smoking marijuana?
        ------------------------------------------------------------
Some immediate physical effects include a faster heartbeat and pulse rate,
bloodshot eyes, and a dry mouth and throat.  No scientific evidence indicates
that marijuana improves hearing, eyesight, or skin sensitivity.

Studies of marijuana's mental effects show that the drug can impair or reduce
short-term memory, alter sense of time, and reduce ability to do things which
require concentration...qfaf...What was I typing?

PART H:  Scout Crap

Here's some crap that a guy in my scout troop kept saying (scouts is damn cool.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          <said in thick Irish accent>
 In the province of Canille <sp>, the natives like to get RIP-ROARIN' DRUNK and
piss on the Blarney Stone.  But the real fun comes the next day when the
tourists come to kiss it for luck!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's the slogans of our Philmont Trek (if you don't know what Philmont is,
you're beyond help.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you taunted a burro today?
Burros are the chronic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is hereby accepted as the GwD slogan of choice.  Look for souvenir "Have
you taunted a burro today?" and "Burros are the chronic." bumper stickers,
coming soon from your friends at GwD.  Why not order our catalog?  Check for
details in the Press Release section.

    That's enough "Cool Stuff" this time around.  I bet you can't wait for "Cool
Stuff 2", can you?  Well, you'll have to, because it will be in GwD100. -Lobo

REVELATION:  GREEN /
 (The Ascension) /
   by Sir Flea /
-------------/
    In the Beginning, There was Grene.  And only Grene.  Until she made from
herself the basic colors.  Blue, Yellow, and Redd.  Redd she did not make, but
was spawned from the chaos that once consumed the universe.
    Several million years later an asshole of a child was born, who's story is
explained in gwd30.txt.  Then a really nice child was born sometime later who's
story is explained in gwd02.txt.  The first child was the will of Redd given
form.  He was evil, mean, and he shit his pants a lot.  His mother was a whore,
and his father was a drunk.  Because his father was always threatening to step
on him with his J.C. Penney pennyloafers, Redd's child now has an instinctive
fear of all pennyloafers.  This sinister child was christened B0b.  His real
last name is Johannsen, but because of his nature, the other children quickly
named him B0b Limekiller.  Which is a title meaning "the destroyer of all that
is green and good."  This child is the Anti-Greeny.
    The really nice child was born of Susan "Yellowie" Hagstrom and James
"Blewie" Allen, it was not known at the time but their lives were being directly
influenced by the Basic Colors of those same names.  The gods had also
influenced the other kids to give them those nicknames so that they could feel
important.  They didn't.  So this guy James knocked 'old Susan up, so they got
married.  They had a nice little kid who they called Jacob "Greeny" Allen.  Gee,
those were some creative people.  As explained in gwd02.txt, he smiled, he
laughed, he even shit his drawers!  It's really easy to see why we picked this
child to be our future emperor.  This is THE Greeny.  (Well, not really.  See
part 5. -Ed.)
                          *The Revelation of Greeny*
        Because the ultimate triumph of Greeny has not occurred as of yet, we at
the Greeny world Domination Task Force thought it necessary to show what will
happen when Greeny finally overcomes the power of Redd and becomes emperor of
the world.  So you Dr00gs out there won't be scared when it happens.
        So Greeny is having an average day, he woke up, shit, and brushed his
teeth.  He ate his breakfast of Mashed Potatoes, because Greeny likes mashed
potatoes, and went with his friends to the mall.  After walking around aimlessly
for about an hour, which is a requirement of going to the mall, Jacob decides
to go into J.C. Penney's. He buys a pair of pennyloafers and puts them into his bag.  He likes
bag and sticks to his tried and true Converse for the moment. Unfortunately,
J.C. Penney's is right next to Cardinals, which everyone knows is a breeding pit
for Redd's evil doings.  As Greeny walks by he feels weakened by the red sign,
and the minions of B0b Limekiller charge him and take him prisoner.  Of course
they couldn't have done this if Greeny hadn't been up all night last night, and
wasn't so tired right now.
        So the minions of Redd take Jacob before the Redd incarnate B0b
Limekiller.  Greeny sees him and starts puking at the disgustingly funny
appearance of B0b.  His hair is cropped short, his nose is long.  His chest is
smooth as silk, his face is rough as sandpaper.  His tattered red clothing makes
him look like a member of the Bloods after a gangwar.  They tie Greeny to a
chair, but the minions are very stupid and Jacob escapes easily.  B0b is amazed
and wonders how the hell Jacob escaped, and he shits his pants because he is so
afraid.  Greeny starts complaining about the smell and kicks B0b in the face.
B0b starts whimpering and mumbling something about his daddy not doing it so
hard.  Greeny starts calling B0b a faggot, and a goddamn mother-fucker and he
shouts something about how, "I'm gonna kick your ass, mother-fucker!"  Because
Greeny doesn't like to lose sleep and he is very cranky.  So he walks over and
starts pissing all over B0b, but he has forgotten that it is from urine, that
B0b gets his strength.  B0b quickly stands up and grabs Greeny and throws him
across the room.  Greeny is so thankful to be away from that awful smell coming
from B0b, that he doesn't even notice he's flying through the air until he hits
the wall.  The collision jars the bag in Jacob's hand loose, and the
pennyloafers fall out onto the floor, as does Jacob's head.  B0b yelps in
fright, and passes out.  There is a big gap here where Redd's minions run away,
and B0b and Greeny lay there unconscious, so we'll just skip it.
        Greeny is the first to awaken, and throws up because of the horrible
smell.  After relieving himself, Greeny walks over and picks B0b up.  Holding
him in one hand, and holding his nose with the other.  If you are wondering how
bad the smell is, then imagine someone taking the spray of a skunk,
concentrating it, making a breath spray out of it, eating shit, spraying that
into his mouth, then waiting for an hour, and of course, breathing right in your
face.  That's how bad it is.
        Well anyway, Greeny takes B0b to his home and ties him up with strings
and ropes the color of green, so B0b will be powerless.  Greeny whispers at him
to wake him up.  Redd wakes up and starts crying, it annoys Jacob so much that
he slaps him with his brand new pennyloafers and then slaps him again for
getting pee on his brand new shoes.  Redd is very mad by this time and starts
whining in his putrid little voice to Grene to help his son.  Grene laughs in
his face and racks him for being so stupid.  Meanwhile, down below, B0b asks to
use the phone, and Jacob kicks him in the balls for no apparent reason, so hard
that once again B0b shits his pants.  So B0b calls all his friends in power
which is basically every dictator, president, or ruling party in the world, and
gets them all on conference call.  He starts whimpering really loudly and Saddam
Hussein gets so disgusted that he reaches through the phone lines and slaps B0b.
Then B0b gets really pissed so he mutters the single word which no human being
can hear and live, he isn't too smart in this fact because if he hears it, he
will die too.  But he says it anyway, and thankfully Greeny at the time was
listening to his favorite story by the Dead Kennedys, specifically, Night of the
Living Rednecks.  So Greeny doesn't hear it.  I'll write that word down here,
just as long as you don't read this aloud.  If you do, you will die.  So just
read it in your head.  The word is...BAGATELLE!  (GwD hereby relieves itself of
any blame for persons not heeding the warnings and saying "BAGATELLE" aloud.  We
warned you not to read it.  Don't come crying to us when you're dead.)  Oh yeah,
might as well get back to the actual story.
        When Greeny turns around and seeing B0b lying in a pool of vomit and
shit, he laughs his ass off.  Upstairs in the heavens, Grene is laughing so hard
that she accidentally racks Redd again, then she does it again just because it's
so fun!  Really, if you ever see the God Redd, just rack him.  It really is fun.
Now, it seems that all the ruling parties in the world is dead, so Greeny gets
on the phone, which is still connected to every country (1st, 2nd, and 3rd world)
on Earth.  He gets all the phones hooked up to loudspeakers in every country,
and says this.  "PEOPLE OF EARTH!  I AM YOUR NEW EMPEROR!  YOU WILL FOLLOW ME!"
And there is a resounding cry of "WHY?"  So Greeny responds with the now famous
reply, which I am not sure quite what it is because I didn't hear it, I was
listening to Dead Kennedys.  Basically it gave Greeny all rights and privileges
of being a World Emperor.  Countries rejoiced, brothers hugged, sisters hugged,
wars were stopped, and peace was achieved.  The only form of violence left was
the hunting Redd's followers for fun.  That's not really violence though is it?
        So that's how Greeny will conquer all of the world and be a really neat
dictator.  Of course, he will just be a figurehead and the real power will be
in the council.  Read gwd10.txt for further explanation of that.

                                  *Epilogue*

                              Greeny rules, yay.

       Chairman of the GwD High Council

TO:    All GwD Task Force Members

DATE:  January 21, 1995

    It is hereby ordered that GwD files will no longer have the name formerly
used as the alter-ego for Greeny [Jacob Allen] in them.  We were wrong.  Greeny
has not yet come to earth from the bosom of Grene, or, if he has, we haven't
found him yet.  The Revelation related above is still held to be true, with the
minor difference that The True Greeny <> Jacob Allen.  We apologize to all of
you for slightly misdirecting you in your journey along the path of Grene.
However, GwD has great plans for 1995 and beyond.  We have doubled the number of
Command Centers we have in the last quarter.  There are many new text files in
the works, and we plan to have more gatherings.  Stay tuned for further details!
    There, now that all that's said, welcome to 1995, boys and girls.  GwD will
still rule one day.  Greeny will still be our figurehead dictator.  The GwD
Council will still hold the power.  B0b Limekiller still lives.  TOFTAOBL is
still active.  We must destroy these dastardly enemies of Grene if we wish to
stay alive.  They know where all of us live.  They have taps on our phone lines.
Be careful, my friends.  You never know who might be an agent of Redd.
GwD must triumph in the end!  We will be relying on you, dr00gs, to help us win
the war.  Greeny must be found.  In fact, I have a good suspicion as to who
might be THE GREEN ONE, the One from the legends.  I'll save the name until
another file though.  I wouldn't want to launch someone into false godhood
again.  There will be many false-Greenys on our way to enlightenment.  One day
(Grene forbid) we might embrace....<gasp!>....B0b as the *true* Greeny.
Hopefully if this ever happens, he will not remain our supposed savior for as
long as the benevolent-yet-annoying Jacob Allen did.  Of course, there are
thousands of other people who would claim to be Greeny.  B0b is just one of many
false-Greenys (though he is the most powerful).  Greeny must be found!
We will keep in touch.

ADDENDUM

DATE:  May 24, 1995

    So we're a little behind schedule on releases.  So what?  If I'd get more
submissions <hint hint>, maybe there'd be more files out.  To submit GwD files,
send them to Lobo on any BBS that he calls.  Or u/l them as GWDSUBM*.TXT where
"*" is the number.  There probably won't be very many submissions on one board
at a given time, so just use the number that comes next (duh) when uploading. If
there are more than 9 submissions, omit the "M" from the filename and use two
digits.  Yay.  Submissions can also be sent to Lobo via netmail.  Send them to
't9scm@ttacs.ttu.edu'.  Or, if you wanna be a real badass, send hardcopy
submissions to:    GwD Incorporated

                                         or something like that.

RE:    GwD is a gang

    According to two in Lubbock, Texas, The GREENY world Domination Task Force
is a gang.  "Let's All Work To Fight Drug Abuse" states that "A gang is a group
of people who interact among themselves to the exclusion of others.  They have a
group name, claim a neighborhood or territory and engage in anti-social
behavior.  Gang members can belong to any race, creed, religious or political
group..."  As you can see, we fit all of these specifications.  We have a name
(GwD, duh), claim a territory (the world, duh again), and engage in anti-social
behavior (I won't even go into that).  Also, we're an equal opportunity Task
Force, allowing anyone to join (with certain discretion, of course).  The
1994-95 Discipline Management Plan of the Lubbock Independent School District
prohibits: "Belonging to secret societies" [gangs].  It states that "Students
shall not become or promise to become members of any organization composed
wholly or in part of students of public schools below the rank of college or
junior college which seeks to perpetuate itself by taking in additional members
from the students enrolled in such school on the basis of the decision of its
membership, rather than upon the free choice of any student in the school, who
is qualified under the rules of the school, to file the special aims of the
organization."  Well, most of the members of GwD are friends from school, and I
always at least Seth (and often other members) before admitting anyone else.  I
guess we're a secret society.  Which reminds me, as a "secret society", we need
to have some sort of excuse to have a three-letter acronym.  If anyone (ie.

what GwD is, the proper response is "It stands for:  God, we're dorks.  It's a
club that anyone can join."  Chances are, most people will not want to know
more.

RE:    Partners In ThoughtCrime

    The Partners in ThoughtCrime?  What the hell is that?  Well, it's the
biggest, baddest thing to hit the 'zine world since gwd01.txt.  No, don't leave!
It's far cooler than early GwD files.  You see, last December, I was reading
posts on DRU (can't help but mention the name of the board it was on, not trying
to sound cooler than you, even though I am) and an ad for a board called
Mogel-Land came up on the screen.  Anyway, I called it, and u/led the GwD files,
and Mogel and his users really liked them.  I d/led his group's files (he ran
the Hogs of Entropy at that time), and we established a friendship.  If I hadn't
call DRU on that faithful day, The Partners in ThoughtCrime might never have
been established. (Oh no!)
    Who are the Partners in ThoughtCrime?  I'm glad you asked.  The answer to
that requires a little bit of a history lesson, though.  You see, Mogel-Land
became a GwD distro. site, and Mogel called Chaos, which became an HoE site.
I had this really nifty idea for something that's never been done in a 'zine
before (to my knowledge, that is.  I won't bore you with details here, besides,
it's gonna happen in the future and I like to build suspense.)  so I talked to
my friend Mogel (yes, it is something that requires cooperation of text groups).
He liked the idea, and soon, The Partners in ThoughtCrime were born.  Why?  We
decided that if lesser known 'zines (like GwD and HoE) teamed up, we could get
larger followings.  We also talked to Black Francis (of pEz), and he wanted to
join up.  Anyway, we decided to found a loose organization that would basically
just advertise for its members.  Around this time, Mogel decided that HoE had
outlived its usefulness; bF was getting tired of pEz as well.  For whatever
reasons, the two groups called it quits.  However, they joined up into a neat
NEW NEW NEW 'zine called Doomed to Obscurity (dto or d2o) which has since
continued in its forerunners' places as GwD's Partner in ThoughtCrime.
    Now you know about the origins of The Partners in ThoughtCrime.  If you'd
like to know more details, read the advertisement following the shout out list.
If you are interested in having your group/'zine join the Partners, please
e-mail Lobo (anon499e@nyx.cs.du.edu) or Mogel (mogel@phantom.com) for
information.

RE:    False Prophets

    The GREENY world Domination Task Force, Incorporated, is dedicated to
exposing false prophets for what they truly are (we also feel that most prophets
are false).  In gwd42-gwd48, GwD ran an expos on Bob Larson, a radio-evangelist
and a false prophet (in our opinion, as well as in the opinions of many others).
Is Bob Larson THE B0b?  It is doubtful, but he's still the enemy.  As time goes
on, GwD will publish exposs on more false prophets.  Hell, we might even write
some of them ourselves (instead of just taking them off of UseNet).  If you have
an evangelist/false profit that you would like us to do a profile on, contact
Lobo.  We have plans for files about two or three other people in the near
future.
NOTE:  Most GwD Exposs on False Prophets will not be as long as the profiles of
Bob Larson.  We merely felt that you needed the whole story and that Mr. Ken
Smith had presented it very well.

Hey guys, how does that sound for our first Press Release after we assume

anyone else decides to go against us.  Talk to me.
