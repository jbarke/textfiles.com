Well, here it is.  #100.  Big fucking deal.  Other e-zines get past this point
within a year.  It's taken us eight.  Why?  Because we're fucking lame, that's
why.  Anyway, here's the deal with this issue:  there's lots of shit in it,
it's super-huge.  It's complete with nude ASCII-pics and lots of references to
BBS stuff that won't mean much to people who weren't there.  If you hunt, you
might find something that applies to you.  Well, it's super huge and won't ever
be completely read by most people.  Maybe that's due to the lack of a Table of
Contents, or maybe that's just because nobody ever reads this stuff regardless
of if it's categorized or not.  Anyway, check it:

-= GREENY world DOMINATION - Reflections On an Acronym, Eight Years Later =-

Perhaps it's not an acronym at all..."gwd" is a Welsh word meaning "twist" or
"turn."  Interesting, given the title of our e-zine.

"GREENY" by Lobo Licious

        Who the hell is the GREENY person anyway?  We've established that He's not
the fellow we originally claimed...so who is He?  This, my dr00gs and
dr00gettes, is the Question of the Ages.
    It is said that He was born (or will be born; we are unsure if He yet
exists...perhaps our charge is merely to prepare the world for His coming) in or
near the 'city' of Gruene, Texas.  He will be a Man, yet He will be from Grene,
so He shall also be More than a Man.  Regardless of the form He takes or the
Body he occupies, He *will* be reluctant to rule this planet.  Thus, GwD must
force Him into figurehead status and rule in His stead as Regents.  Such is the
Plan of Grene, She who is Most High and Mighty and She who lives to dispense the
Lovin'.

    GREENY loves the world and its environment (why else would His Mother have
    inspired our organization to Dominate it?) and despises polluters and
    defilers.  The Green Jihad shall come to those who oppose.
    FEAR THE GREEN JIHAD, BLASPHEMER, LEST YOU FACE ITS WRATH!

    GREENY hates you.  Face it, you're nothing special, and He knows it.  You
    are a worthless pile of slime, as far as He's concerned.  Unless you give
    lots and lots of money to the cause.  Then, He will see you as a useful pile
    of slime.  Actually, His opinion of you won't change, but our's will, and
    since He's a figurehead, He really doesn't matter.  Did I say that?

    GREENY hates me.  He thinks I smell funny.

    GREENY hates GwD and everything for which we stand.  Take over the world in
    His name?  "Poppycock!" exlaims GREENY at such a laughable notion.

    GREENY hates GREENY; He simply does not want to be Emperor and He hates
    Himself for having such a destiny.

    GREENY is the Beginning and the End, the Alpha and the Omega (He is also
    everything in the Middle, the Gamma, the Delta, the Epsilon, etc.)  He is ALL
    THINGS, and yet, He is NOTHING.  He is NOT the Buddha.  He is NOT Jesus.  He
    is NOT "Bob."  He is GREENY.  GREENY, damn you, GREENY.  Nothing more,
    nothing less.  Set your standards low, my friends.  Expect little and you
    will not be disappointed.

    Thus it is, thus it was, and thus it shall be.  Praise be to Grene.  Amen.  
And a-women.

"world" by Bob the Master of the World

    The "world" in "GREENY world Domination" must be understood correctly if the
phrase in which it is embedded is to be understood correctly.  However, the term
is problematic, bearing a number of different meanings.  Perhaps "meanings"
suggests an ambiguity that does not really exist in the term; "spheres of
application," though awkward, may be more appropriate. The basic sense, in which
the "world" is equated with Earth, is only one denotation of the term.  "World"
is also used to mean everything that comes with the ken of human knowledge;
consequently, the moon is part of our "world," "world" being here conceived in a
fundamentally humanistic sense.  Expanding the reference of the term to its
logical limits, metaphysics construes the phrase "the world" as denoting the
"totality of facts" and "all that is the case," as Wittgenstein puts it in the
opening lines of _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_.
    However, the term also has denotations that are far reduced in scope.
"World" is often employed as the totality of a particular field or sphere of
life.  For example, we often speak of the "world of movies," the "world of
science," "the world of prisons," "the world of Droogies," and so on.  "World"
can also refer to the totality of an individual's consciousness, a phrase we
commonly attach to those individuals who deviate so drastically from the rest of
society that they are said to reside in a "world of their own."  Jean-Paul
Sartre meditates on the disintegration of the individual world by the intrusion
of other consciousnesses in Being and Nothingness: "The appearance of the Other
in the world corresponds therefore to a fixed sliding of the whole universe, to
a decentralization of the world which undermines the centralization which I am
simultaneously effecting."  In other words, the presence of the Other forces
onto the individual the knowledge that the world is not his world, that it does
not exist solely within the confines of his consciousness.  Ideology has as its
target this "world" of the individual in its attempt to force the individual
into its world.
    Which "world" does GwD wish to Dominate?  Well, the very fact that the term
is written in lower case would suggest that GwD aims to Dominate the denotations
of the term that are smaller in scope.  Of course, this suggestion is consonant
with the ideological nature of GwD, an organization that has consistently placed
thought above action.

"DOMINATION" by Seth the Man

People have two roles in life, Dominator and submissive...

Aww yeah, it's "The End of Death:"

	Redd (dba Death) has had a false domination over the living for a long time
(not forever, but for some time before "modern" society)...It's created all the
bad things in the world out of fear...all 'evils' stem from a fear of death...
Anyway, GwD will turn this around. Life will Dominate Death. "After Death was
lost, humanity entered an eternity of celebration, and much was dominated."
    And, yay, the word is "lost" and not "destroyed" or "killed" or anything
like that...(cuz there's an obvious paradox in "killing", not that I mind
paradoxes, we couldn't call ourselves a religion without paradoxes but at any
rate, we can't say Death (Redd) died, because there has to be some Redd in
reality to balance it all out...yeah.  I'm rambling.)

Bleah.  Anyway, just some thoughts I had on the way to work this morning.
I think Domination has always been a part of religion, and that we are probably the 
first to openly admit it..

Submit to Grene...or even better...Grene is ready for her spanking...

oi. That's bad.

-= GwDwarez Stuff =-

The following is a message and a bunch of shit from GwDwarez.  Contrary to what
you may think (or even what you may have been led to believe), GwDwarez and
GwD Publications ARE NOT the same thing.  They are both subsidiaries of the 
conglomerate that is GwD, Inc.  Thus, the information given below is attributed
to GwDwarez, so GwD Publications holds no responsibility if the info is 
accurate or not.  Yeah.

"So, like, it's time to jump on the open source bandwagon.  Sure, nobody would
ever want to update or change any of our programs, because they ROCK SERIOUS
NADS, but alas, here's the source codes for a few of them.  Uhh, if you can
find a TurboPascal compiler, these should work.  Cut-and-paste, my friends,
cut-and-paste.  This code is available under the GNU public license, I think.
Something like that, anyway.  Edit it, make it better.  That shouldn't be hard.
Keep us in the loop; let us know what killer updates you make.  Yes.  No profits
from this code, please, unless you give us a cut.  Not that this will ever be an
issue...

Umm, if any of these fuck anything up when you run them, we're not liable; they
are being distributed error-free and any errors caused upon compiling are not
the fault of GwDwarez, GwD Publications, or GwD, Inc., nor are they the fault of
any member or officer thereof.

Why are only a few of the GwDwarez being made open source (5 to 7 years after
being released)?  Well, the other programs use proprietary technology and so
their source cannot be made publicly available at this time.  Executable versions
of these programs (as well as many other lame-ass GwDwares are available for
free download at http://www.GREENY.org/warez/warez.html.

Provided here, if available, are the documentation and file_id.diz for each of
the GwDwarez.  Many of them are distributed without docs...go to
http://www.GREENY.org/warez/ to test the executables for yourself, even the
ones that aren't opensource...yay!

Enjoy."

Well here is my ware that I decided to distribute.
I have a version of this running in my autoexec.bat to use 50 line mode
and to use a faster repeat rate (it helps because I type faster...)
because my Dad's can't read anything in 50 line mode, so now it allows
me to use it when I get on without having to type all the commands in,
and it allows my Dad to not have to call me in from across the house
to change to big and slow for him...

Anyway, this is my first attempt at writing in C++ and it was compiled
on a demo version of Zortech C++ that I got with my C++ book "Learning
C++" by Tom Swan. To use this program, just patch in the sample.bat file
into any batch that you want to use this in, and stick the executable in
a directory that's handy for the batch you are running...usually
somewhere in your path, but not always... Be sure and alter the sample
batch to run whatever commands you want, the batch file is pretty
self-explanatory.

Have fun with this ware.

If something goes wrong, I didn't do it. You did.

                                   GwDware #3

DIRECTIONS:  Type GWD_3 in the directory you have the file in (duh).  Whenever
             you are asked for a number (ie. the year, a person's age) enter a
             number.  Self-explanatory.  If you enter the age of the oldest
             person first, the program will still execute, but you won't like
             what it does 8-).  When asked for a factor, pick a number, (like
             '2').  The program will then express the ages in factors of the
             number entered and tell the year those factors will be correct.
             For instance, to find out when you will be exactly half the age of
             someone else.  Entering '2' as the factor would do this.  I know it
             doesn't make much sense, but trust me.

Well, this is a really silly program that will tell the year in which two people
will be certain factors of each others' ages, or something like that.  I wrote
this one day when i was really bored, so don't whine about its lameness.

GWD_3 was written in Turbo Pascal, and I copied it from my Algebra book.  Of
course, in the book, the program was in BASIC (woo woo), so I at least had the
decency to translate it from a dead language.  I also added some stuff, so it's
not really plagiarized.  Blah.  Anyway, have fun with it.

(note:  GWD_1 was also copied from my Algebra book and converted into TP from
BASIC.  I am so damn cool.)

[Disclaimer]
        You are using this program at your own risk.  
        If you received an originally packaged copy,  it is most likely virus
free.  Although we try to keep our computers clean, the possibilities of virii
is real.  We are not responsible for any virulent code that accompanies this 
program.  
        This program has undergone basic testing on our own computer systems, 
or systems that we are familiar with.  This program will not, to our 
knowledge, cause any damage to a standard IBM compatible running MS-DOS 5.0
or later.  If this program does cause any damage to your system, it's not
our fault.
        We make no guarantees that this program will function as described
on your own computer system.  This is something that we do in our spare time,
don't expect much.  We will do our best, but we aren't close to professional,
and are just entering college.
        Bill and Lobo's Hyper Elite Programmer's Guild, and The Greeny world
Domination Taskforce are not responsible for any damages resulting from
the use of this program.

[Intro]
        Yep. Here we go again. Another little proggie(well, not another if
you haven't been privileged enough to see the first few).  This program
continues in the tradition of Disk Access, and Number Crap, and all other
BLHEPG releases, with a new twist.  Unlike most of our programs, this was
written outside of Charby's CS class.  This program comes to you from Bill
Hooper's trip to Asia(India to be specific). 

[Description]
        This program gives your DOS screen a small GwD logo in the upper, 
right hand corner.  Due to the magical abilities of the TSR(Terminate 
Stay Resident), this logo will remain on screen through all DOS applications
that use a normal 25X80 ASCII screen.  It's a simple program written very
quickly and inefficiently.

[Instructions]
        Hmm.. Run the exe (GWDLOGO.EXE). Yeah, that's about all there is
to it.  At the command prompt, type GWDLOGO.  You can't unload this version
from memory, wah.  If, for some unknown reason, you want to remove the 
beautiful logo from your screen, reboot the computer if in DOS mode or 
close the DOS window, if that's what you're using.

[Known Bugs, etc..]
        What this program does is basically write directly to video memory,
changing the background attribute of a certain area of the screen in a 
specified pattern.  When the screen scrolls, that background also scrolls.
This action creates a problem.  To keep the display from screwing up, I have
the program reset the attribute of all surrounding characters to a cyan 
foreground and black background.  This is the reason that it's not too pretty
when in DOS Edit, or some other ANSI GUI interface program. If you have any
good ideas on how to get around this problem, I'd love to hear.
        This program has undergone cursory testing. There are no guarantees
that it will work on your computer system or with all of your computer
programs.  TSRs are not friendly things to program or play with.  If you have
any specific questions, email me.
           
[Plans]
        I might add some new stuff if I ever get a new version out. Dunno.
If there's anything that you would like to see in the program, please, don't
hesitate to ask..

[Stuff]
        If you need anything custom programmed, you can contact us. Although
it may not be apparent, we really can program worthwhile stuff if we have
to.  The stuff we release is just for the hell of it.  Bill Hooper is an
entering freshman at MIT, Lobo is an entering freshman at Texas Tech 
University. They are both planning to major in Computer and Electronics
type subject.  We work for cheap depending on the project.  We do stuff in
HTML, Delphi, C++, Pascal, C++ Builder.  We're currently learning 
Java/JavaScript, Perl, and other things. Dunno. If you're interested, contact 
us.

[Greetz]
        A special thanks goes out to those that have taken the time to answer
my questions on IRC(too many to list).  If you like this program, please take
the time to help out  at least 5 people on IRC, and encourage them to do the
same. It really pisses me off when people pull that "holier than thou" shit.
Ebonics is silly too. Especially when white people use it(That's personal
though).

[Contacts]
        In the current day of the "information super highway", "infobahn", 
or whatever silly euphemism you want to use for the internet, it's easy to
contact us.  If you have any nice questions or comments, don't hesitate
to drop us a line. Membership in BLHEPG is exactly what it says, Hyper-Elite. 
There are no members other than Bill and Lobo. Period.
        If you have any questions or comments about GwD, see their contact
section.

...About GwD in general:

   "This [GwD] is a fine group that I associate with (I haven't ever written for
   them [uhh, yeah you have], but I know most of the guys who founded it). It's
   a zany bunch of young, angst-ridden anarchists from a lovely place called
   Lubbock, Texas" - Kilroy

   "GwD is the single greatest fighting force ever assembled." - Saddam Hussein

   "Yea! Greeny world Domination rocks! whee.. fun fun. This textfile group is
   'hot'." - Bill Hooper

...About _GwD:  The American Dream with a Twist - of Lime_

   "This [GwD98] is one of the greatest t-files ever." - Grandmaster Ratte'

   "A collection of text files written by some of my best buddies in Lubbock. If
   you were into computers during your teen years, this zine will bring back
   great memories." - NetLegend Jaffo's List'o'links

   "Some of the finest t-files to date, yet also some of the shittiest...if only
   they'd choose quality OR quantity to focus on, instead of neither...100 files
   in eight years is nothing to scream about, especially since more than half of
   them suck...it sure keeps us guessing, though." - Ratt Fink

   "cDc who?  GwD burst onto the textfile scene in 1993 and has KICKED ASS ever
   since." - Commodore Schmidlap

...About GwDweb and/or The world Domination PlayStation:

   "Review
   Site: The world Domination PlayStation
   Rating: 4 URL: http://www.geocities.com/Athens/2334/
   This site has plenty of colour and some good graphics. It is an e-zine known
   as 'GwD: The American Dream with a Twist of Lime'. A different site to check
   out." - Webnet Webratings

   The world Domination PlayStation was given 3 bananas out of 5 by the Worth A
   Peek Awards

   The Inkpot Zine List includes GwDweb and gets both our name AND our (main)
   publication's name correct!  [Believe it or not, this is a rarity, even among
   members of our group.]

...About [Bill Hooper's] Humor List:

   saw your awsome list I changed my mind and decided to go harvest wheat
   instead! Thank You!" - Anonymous List Member

   "bill, your humor is offending me. I can't take it. I'm going to kill myself
    and it will be your fault!" - Justin [List Member]

"Ignorance vs. Thoughtlessness" by Seth The Man

    I was getting food last night at Schlotzsky's and parked next to a car
with an Ani DiFranco sticker.  I was looking at the sticker (I'm a big Ani fan)
and noticed another one underneath it that said "Ignorance is Typical".  I
didn't like the tone of that sticker very much and I was thinking about why this
was.  I think it's kind of a hypocritical.  So much is chalked up to ignorance,
when really, ignorance is not the root of any problem, it only points to the
real problem, thoughtlessness.  Lack of Knowledge holds no sin of itself.  It is
the problem of not wanting to pursue the knowledge needed to create an informed
opinion or decision that is the real problem.  The attitude of falling back to
preset beliefs, without conscious consideration of the issue, through laziness
or faith, is what the real problem is.  The sticker is as guilty of this mistake
as any racist or zealot.

"Super Villain" by Yancey Slide

This isn't finished - in fact, I only just started.  But I'm working on poetry
now:
  
They call me super-villain
But what do they know? 
Maybe I'm not (so) super.
  
I'll show them all, someday.
Show them all I'm not mad
Just very angry.
  
I'd have shown them all already
If not for interlopers
Interfering super-pants.
  
Why should they care
If I taint the reservoir?
I have a  job to do.
  
And who are they
To bust up my lab?
Damned vigilantes.

Ok. I'll keep this mass-mail short n' simple.

This weekend(Friday 3/1 thru Sunday 3/3) is another netgame party. Rockin' 
stuff. Things to bring if at all possible:

-- 486 with 8M ram or better machines are needed. No 'puters=no games. If you 
   have a keen computer(s), bring 'em. Don't forget your power strip.

-- Games. Any network playable games that you think the rest of us might not 
   have, bring it. We may just play it. 

-- Netcards. If you have some cards or cable, bring it just in case. I already
   have 12 cards, but more is better.

-- Munchies. Cokes. Chips. Whatever. If we all pitch in, we can munch away the
   whole time we're gaming.

This thing may flop, with only 7-8 people, or it may be huge with 16 or more 
folks. Depends on how many of YOU show up. Heh.

Also, as long as I'm into the public announcement thing......March 17th(St. 
Patty's Day) is a Sunday and is 1/2 price indoor paintball.

April 6th is paintball, but with easter eggs filled with small prizes out on 
the field for you to grab while you play. Heh.

I guess that's it.

I'M ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED GOING TO THE K-MART ON UNIVERSITY 'CAUSE IT'S JUST LAME.
IT JUST SCREAMS "WE HAVEN'T REMODLED SINCE '79 AND WAL-MART IS DESTROYING US."
 
ALL THE K-MART EMPLOYEES ARE SULLEN AND SHIFTLESS SINCE WAL-MART CAME TO TOWN.
AND SEARS EMPLOYEES?  FORGET IT.  THEY MIGHT AS WELL WORK IN A MUSEUM.  AND WHAT
IF YOU'RE THE TOY DEPT. GUY AT SEARS?  YOU'RE A LEPER, MAN, SINCE TOYS 'R' US
BROKE GROUND.  YOU CAN'T EVEN HOLD YOUR HEAD UP.  THEY SIT AROUND IN THE
EMPLOYEE LOUNGE, DRINKING WHISKEY OUT OF A THERMOS BOTTLE ON 15-MINUTE BREAKS
THAT STRETCH INTO 2-HOUR BINGE SESSIONS.

HEY, I JUST GOT MY NEXT SONG IDEA.

AND DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU GUYS TAKE MY BRILLIANT POST IDEAS AND USE
'EM TO SEEM WITTY WITH THE CHICKS.  AND I FUCKING HATE YOU FOR IT.  FOREVER.
HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA: GO DIE.  NOW.  THANKS.

    "Freddy also appeals to minorities.  'There's enormous affection for the
character in the black community,' says Harpster.  'It always playes as you
would expect along the easter seaboard, in Detroit's large black population.  It
never played well in the lily-white areas, like Seattle or Kansas.  It's
basically an urban kind of phenomenon.  It didn't do very well in Nebraska.'

    ...

    'Avid moviegoers are the key audience for any movie.  They may be blue-
collar, they may be black, they may have high-school educations, but filmwise
they know their stuff.'"

(from pg. 132 of _The Nightmare Never Ends_ by William Schoell and James
Spencer, Citadel Press, 1992.)

The above, of course, implies that while blue-collar/black/lacking in higher
education people "know their stuff" about movies, they are essentially inferior
in all other aspects.  Way to go, Hollywood!  Fine, this implication is a little
bit of a stretch...but just a little.

"Yeeouch!!!" by Odin Jesse

Yeeouch!!!  Them pins is pointy!

	  I'm a fuckin' Aries.  Hmmm?.
      Born and raised in the hub city of Temple, Texas but I've been all over
the place.  From the Great Smoky mountains to Seattle to Georgetown DC, the self
proclaimed capital of the weirdest teenagers with the rarest genital gland
problems in the free world although all I can think about is New Orleans and
those jumbo shrimp.  Not the fuckin' Grouper though.  Damn thing tastes worse
than it looks.  Big blank bulging eyes and their damn mouths are constantly open
like Leslie Cowan.  Not that anything doesn't show a direct relationship between
taste and physical appearance.  Mushrooms are the ugliest fucking growths you'll
ever find and pig's brain brings a proportionately revolting odor into the
equation for fun.  I suppose it's kind of like when you piss in the sink and
turn on the hot water to "clean it off" and it merely magnifies the smell of
urine that inevitably leads to your sister getting really pissed and calling you
a lazy slob.  Not that she wouldn't do it if pissing was a more convenient
pastime for women.  A guy can piss on anything but not his leg.
	  Wow, a whole damn paragraph out of the way.  
      Small medium or large, free refill available!  The color wheel indicates
that red and green, the pious colors that emulate the eve of the birth of Jesus,
are comparable to the combinations of orange and blue as well as purple and
yellow.  Ewwwww?. Those colors are yucky, now when you die you go to hell! Green
and red indicate the combination of radiator fluid that mixes with the blood
flowing from my hand after a near fatal ratchet accident.  Whelp?  I just opened
her up and noticed that yer differential was leaking on yer alternator belt
which is causing the problems in yer carburetor's catalytic conversion fuel
injection system on that V6 385 drive shaft.  By the way, today only buy forty
car air fresheners and get the forty-first one free.  Free installation if
you've got a rear view mirror.
      I walked eighteen redwoods down to the gym and got on the scale.  I
weighed 9.477 cinderblocks, looks like I've gained a little.  So I got on the
treadmill for 1/1x10^478 eons and got so fucking tired I went to buy one of
those big jugs of water, you know, the kind that hold 475 mouthfuls of water,
but I noticed that I left all my chariot wheels at home and they wouldn't take a
check.
      It's a good thing I ran into that chick last night.  She'd be fucked if I
hadn't been there to walk her home.  A bitch like that has no business out
there without a man.  She was so excited she barely could even talk to me.  I
bet she didn't think she'd ever be lucky enough to meet a guy like me.  After
all, when I was talking about running four miles after every meal and bench
pressing 385 she was so impressed she couldn't even look me in the eye.  Then
when I started talking about the turbo charger and glass packs in my '99 ford
F150 XLT she must have thought she was in heaven.  She'll be calling me any
minute now, just as soon as she finishes washing her hair.
      This salt doesn't supply Iodide, I wonder if they have any artificially
flavored soybean Iodide supplements here.  The woman at Taco Bell last night
gave me a receipt with my bean burrito.  I couldn't imagine a circumstance in
which I had to prove that I bought a fuckin' burrito.  I'll give her the money,
she gives me the burrito, there's no need to bring ink and paper into the
transaction.  But, in case someone is like, "Man, that's bullshit.  Ain't no way
you got a burrito the other night."  I'll have the documentation ready.  It's
back at the dorm in the filing folder.  Under "B", for burrito.
      I like that song that goes, "Dunnnn Dun Dun Duh Dunn Duh Dun diggadigga
Dun Dun Dunn Duh Dunn", you know the one, right?  If I ever end up having a
roommate that's a total asshole dickhead dipshit fucker I think I'll buy a bunch
of those Nicotrol cigarette patches and put one on his ankle when he's asleep
every night.  Then I'll get up before he does and take it off.  That way I'll
get him really addicted and he won't know what's going on and he'll go through
withdrawal during the day.  Sounds like fun.
      Man, fuck school.  I hate always having to do shit and get up early and
always be worried about shit.  I'm starting to realize that a college education
isn't remotely necessary to get a great job.  Some of my happiest memories are
of working at Fast Eddy's Pizza with some of the finest degenerates Temple has
to offer.  I think I'll be a pirate or a caveman or a con artist or a bounty
hunter or a male prostitute.  Any of those jobs would be a hell of a lot more
interesting than a damn engineer.  Well, it looks like if we change the torque
on the bar supporting the cog we can maximize energy output.  Bullshit.  I'm
going to live in a cave somewhere in Asia and think all the time and eat small
animals and piss and shit in the woods.  The secret to happiness is to escape
from money as early as possible.  There isn't anyone in the world that thinks
you can live without money.  All it does is tie you into the system with all the
people you never wanted to be like when you were a child, when you knew a hell
of a lot more about happiness than you know now.  The sooner you get out the
better because the longer you stay in the more dependencies you develop.  See,
if I were to do it now I'd still have the need for a friend and a musical
instrument that I wouldn't have needed if I had escaped ten years ago.  If I
wait longer I'll simply become weaker and dependent on more worldly things.
But, instead of doing something I'm sitting by the damn computer.  Somehow
nothing lasts forever yet some things never change.  I think I hear the arsenic
singing to me.
      Oh of course!! I love John!  Oh really?  Oh, how cute, yeah I know, I love
Kyle, he's so funny.  Oh, I know, she's such a total bitch, like totally.  Trent
is?  Oh that's wonderful, I love Trent.  Yeah, she's sort of a bitch too.  Oh
yeah I know, I just saw him at the mall, I love him.  He's so cute!!  No, no,
no, WHAT?  You're such a bitch!!!
      I suppose the only difference I can think of between the word entriphereal
and the word naphroscocic is the context in which they'd be used.  Entriphereal
would be used to describe something pretty or maybe a dream or maybe a cool song
or something.  Naphroscocic should be used to describe an injury or a disaster
or maybe a part of a tractor.  They're both very useful, sort of like the word
Modescent, which can describe a scary book, or a cool looking car, or the taste
of bad food.  Considering all three are fuckin' made up I suppose Modescent is
my favorite because it's been more widespread.  I invented it in high school and
used it in reports and essays all the time.  I never had a teacher comment about
it.  They're obviously too embarrassed to admit that they don't know what the
hell it means and some high school dumbass does.  I think it's very entriphereal
of them.  In fact, I think I might do something to the naphroscocic converter
belt on their car just to piss them off.
      OH MY GOD!!!  OH MY GOD!!! I JUST SAW THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE ON THE
WEATHER CHANNEL!! IT WENT FROM 67 TO 66 DEGREES!!  I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN IT
CHANGE BEFORE!!   HEY EVERYBODY, ITS 66 DEGREES OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW!!!!
      I was born on the exact day that Jesus Christ was crucified for the sins
of the world.  Good Friday, the most sacrilegious day of the year.  I hope
that's not some kind of omen.  God is probably pissed at me for being born that
day, that must be why I haven't gotten my grandma's Range Rover yet.  Hmmm?  I
KNOW!! I'll say the lords prayer one hundred times tonight.  He'll have to
forgive me then, right?  
      What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?  I'd probably
ask him why the hell he's drunk early in the morning.  That's an evening thing
around here.  He must be a damn foreigner, probably one of those freaks from
Poland.  Ewww?.
      Whoa? it's 8:30 already?  Hey, it's been a nice evening but I really
better get going.
      Alcohol abuse is a disease.  But it's the only disease you can get bitched
at for having.  Dammit Odin!  You're an alcoholic!  Dammit Odin!  You have
Lupus!  Dammit Odin!  You have Leprosy!  Dammit Odin!  You have Ebola!  Dammit
Odin!  You have the gout!
      Unfortunately Kevin Johnson won't be joining us this evening as he is at
home asleep.  I think I'd rather lose and arm than a leg.  I'd rather be blind
than deaf.  I'd rather be ugly than smelly.  I'd rather be dead than insane.
I'd rather be middle class than aristocracy.  I'd rather be annoying than
ignorant.  I'd rather be unappreciated than talentless.  And at the end of the
day, even though engineering isn't the most fulfilling of jobs I can always
smile and say, "Well, at least I'm not working for you."
      Hmm? this stuff really doesn't taste too bad.  It kinda smells funny,
though.  Ok, I give up, what is it?  OH MY GOD!!!  ARE YOU SERIOUS!!!  THAT'S
NOT FUCKIN' FUNNY, MAN!!!  I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS!!
      Save the whales, Collect them all!!  I saw that fool yesterday and he was
all "Sup dog" and I was all "Sup wit you?" and he was like "Wussup then, bitch!"
and I was like "Step up nigga" and he was like "I see wussup now, bitch"  and I
was like "Say nigga, you be trippin" and he was like "It's on then, nigga" and I
was like "Arite dog!"  and he was like "Wussup then" and I was like "Yeah,
that's what I thought" and he was like "Say nigga, Say" and I was like "awright
den, it's cool brother"  and he was like "Awright homie, peace out" and I was
like "That's cool dog".
      Hey man, Yanni's playing live on the 15th.  If I were to make an album I
would definitely not put any of that evil devil music on there or any of that
loud crap all the punks listen to, or any of that rap shit the thugs listen to,
or any of the country shit the hicks listen to, or any of that oldies shit my
parents listen to, or any of that blues shit the bums listen to, or any of that
techno shit those weirdos listen to, or any of that classical stuff those old
people listen to, or any of that other crap.  Just twelve tracks of total
silence.  Hell yeah, that's good music!!!
      The worst part about being alive is when you stub your toe on the kitchen
table.  One time my uncle was building a house for his daughter because she was
about to get married.  Me and my cousin were helping him.  I was up on the
second floor and I was trying to hammer this support beam to one of the rafters.
I accidentally dropped the hammer and it hit my uncle in the back of the head
and knocked him out.  The bad part about it was at the time he was working at
the table saw and when he got knocked out he fell forward on the blade and cut
his head off.  It was the grossest thing I've ever seen.  He was all twitching
and shit.  My cousin was slightly upset about what happened and he tried to run
and tell the rest of the family.  However, I knew that if he told my mom I'd
probably get grounded and I wanted to go to the movies with my friends that
weekend.  So I ran after my cousin and poked a _ inch drill bit in the side of
his neck to get his attention.  He turned to see what I wanted but when I was
trying to explain that I didn't want him to tell the family he passed out.  I
think it was probably because the drill bit was buried about two inches deep
into his neck and passed through his carotid artery.  Well, I couldn't let mom
know about him either so I took them out to the shop and used the sandblaster to
tear their bodies into oblivion.  I suppose nobody ever found them.  And I got
to go to the movies with my friends that weekend so I guess the story has a
happy ending after all.
      I read that Jacob Stryver from Ireland has been declared the man with the
cleanest urine in the entire world.  Something about his kidneys and his eating
habits.  But, I'd still drink my own before his.
      If fruit had individual personalities I think that bananas would be the
funny ones.  Peaches would be the manic-depressive ones.  Strawberries would be
the sexy ones.  Pears would be very intelligent but kind of quiet.  Oranges
would be really active and you'd never see them very often.  Cherries would be
egocentric and arrogant.  Grapes would be old and grouchy.  Blueberries wouldn't
be very funny or intelligent but they would think they were.  Raspberries would
be friendly but humble.  And Grapefruit would be tyrannical, bitchy, assholes.
      A day without sunshine is like night.  On the other hand, you have
different fingers.
      Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.  If Barbie
is so popular why do you have to buy her friends.  Ewww? just think about
creamed corn.  To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from many
is research.  I intend to live forever, so far so good.  If at first you don't
succeed, then skydiving isn't for you.

      Hey man, I'm going down to that one place where those guys go like
"Blaaauugh" on that little thing.
      The finest example of an igloo that I can think of was the one that was in
the Inuit museum in Washington, DC.  I liked it because it was an actual size
replica of a 15th century Aleutian igloo that housed up to eight families.
Unfortunately, as is common in public museum the exhibit had been defaced by the
time I saw it.  There were Coke cans and candy wrappers all over the place and
some of the details on the Aleutian mannequins had been stolen.  The only other
eyesore was the eighteen decapitated infant carcasses rotting in the background.
      Sometimes I wonder why human bodies have some of the parts that they have.
I don't know why men have nipples, appendixes, or kidneys.
      He went into the kitchen and got that steak knife that he bought at the
livestock show and went back into the bedroom and stabbed his wife in the leg.
He didn't like her very much.  But afterwards he felt bad so he called an
ambulance which was slightly delayed as it was destroyed when it was side-swiped
by at quadruple-back tractor trailer that was illegally driving on the road in
the first place.  So he ended up driving her to the hospital himself.  She was
so impressed by this sudden act of kindness that she accidentally bit her tongue
off and began to choke.  He drove faster because her condition was somewhat more
urgent now.  She recovered in seven and a half days and they returned to their
house where they were killed in a surprise terrorist bombing raid on the
neighborhood.
      I give my liiiiiiiiiffffeee and sooooouuuuuullll to you my friend, you let
me faaauuuullll.  Trapped in a gaze where time stands insurrected to a blur.
Before this river becomes an ocean, before you pick my heart up off the floor.
If I was God you'd sell your soul.  Get in the pit and try to love someone.
Whoring redeemer embezzles the weak.  Come closer, you can do better than me.  I
ask myself why I'm so hateful.  Fucking envy changes everything.

Theres no warez, no codez, hell...no files period....I don't even have message 
basses or onliners....come to think of it, I don't even have BBS software set 
up.....so call The Non-Existant Board at 832-4287....if yer lucky you might 
just catch the sysop, Trojan-Man, in Telemate and actually get a connect....and
then I'm sure he'll think of something cool to give you...or maybe not, but
you'll never know till you call.....so go call it you shmuck....ATA is a good
thing.

when I leave sos I won't be here when the people that actually live here get

L> nothing but silicone and air.

 Silicone. Ramblings on silicone.

  Ya know, if medical science could discover a way to turn the silicone in 
breast implants into some type of processing device, neural net, et al, then 
Pamela Anderson would put any Cray to shame.

     Yeah. Her and Dolly Parton. You could network 'em by nipple clamps and 
then ask them the meaning of life. The answer would prolly be 42.

 Think about it.. Models would actually become USEFUL.

Seriously, though:  If you play online and enjoy playing with your clan
members, this can be *the* tool for you.  You are encouraged to use the chat
functionality whenever playing online.  It is recommended that all members of
clan [Chach] who play online connect to one of the GamesNet IRC servers and
join channel #chach prior to starting an online game.  This will allow other
members of clan [Chach] to easily find you online and join up with you!

Feedback is welcome.  Bugs/problems/suggestions/feedback/insults can be
reported to jason.plumb@home.com or can be posted to the ChaosLAN list for

D> again(10am-8pm Sat & Sun shifts are _not_ conducive to being militant-b0y. 

  Militancy is cool. When I get my discharge (22 NOV 98) I'm going to start a 
militia. You can all join! We'll be the cyberhackermilitia, feared by the 
pulic, the ATF, the FBI, the CIA (Christians In Action?) the US Marshals, the 
Texas Rangers, the NSA, the DIA, the KGB, Mossad, SF, SAS, GIGN, GSG-9, and 
all sorts of other alphabet soup agencies! We'll be a scourge! Cheesy lame 
post! Trying to start posting up! Pathetic attempt! Pathetic attempt!

Speaking of religions, my new hobby is calling the Dianetics/Scientology(TM) 
information hotline 1-800-FOR-TRUTH (call it yourself!) and asking them 
perfectly logical questions that they don't like to answer.

Questions like:

Who is Xenu?

Who is Paulette Cooper, and why was "Operation Freakout" launched against her?

How can a religion have "trade secrets?"

Was L. Ron Hubbard committed to a mental hospital (Oak Knell Naval Hospital to
be exact) after his discharge from the Navy?

Did L. Ron Hubbard's third wife attempt to divorce him on the grounds that he 
was insane?

Who was the first clear?

If clears have such phenomenal superhuman abilities, why haven't they taken 
over the planet yet?

And others. I've got a huge list of Frequently Unanswered Questions (FUQ, not 
FAQ) to ask them, but they won't answer. Consider my most recent exchange:

Clam: Dianetics, may I help you?

Me: Yes. I was wondering if you could answer me a few questions about 
Scientology.

Clam: Certainly.

Me: Who is Paulette Cooper?

Clam: I don't know. I've never heard that name. What are you talking about?

Me: Well then, who is Xenu?

Clam: I don't know. What does that have to do with anything?

Me: Isn't Dianetics part of Scientology?

Clam: Of course.

Me: Then who is Xenu? Isn't he part of Scientology beliefs?

Clam: I've never heard of it. It doesn't concern me.

Me: So you've never taken the OT III course material, because he's mentioned 
in there quite frequently.

Clam: I don't see what that has to do with you. Excuse me, I have to answer 
another call.

Me: Oh, so you don't want to answer my perfectly logical questions, like L. 
Ron Hubbard(TM) said you should.

<CLICK>

ElRon, God of Scamitology, is frequently quoted as telling all his people to 
answer any and all questions people have, for only then will Scientology be 
doing its mission. Clearly, they don't want to follow his advice anymore.

that's it. now it's on. FOR THE LAST TIME, EL NINO IS NOT A STORM. IT IS A
FULL-FLEDGED PHENOMENON. and it's not a little boy. it's named after JESUS
friggin' CHRIST. he is THE little boy. he died for our sins, or so i hear.
anyway, enough of that stuff. 

we control El Nino with our zepellins (i don't care if it's spelled right).
you'd be able to read ALL about it if Seth the Man would get off his FUCKING
FAT ASS and WRITE A FUCKING PRESS RELEASE so we can finish gwd55 and RELEASE

"A Nightmare" by Jaffo (09-22-00)

I just had a nightmare. A genuine jump-out-of-bed, turn-all-the-lights-on,
bench-clearing nightmare. I was aware that by some magic, I had traveled in my
sleep to a house in West Virginia. It was present day, but in my dream-state, I
knew the history of the place, as if some invisible tour guide was telling me
about it as I walked through in my pajamas. 

I started in the back yard, listening to a tale of how the evidence was found.
It was 1905. The Indians came upon the place on October 3rd or 4th, the records
are not clear. The found a house burnt, but not badly burnt, a woman's body
smouldering in the back yard under the bushes. 

The fire started there and spread to the rest of the house. No one knows where
the husband went, or why he killed her. In the dream, I'm standing in the yard
of this old house, running my fingers through the soil where the body was. And
in my dream, I am afraid. It's the fear of walking into a haunted house, all
alone, with no one around for miles.

I couldn't see the ghosts, but I could feel them. They were all around me,
waiting to jump out at any moment and yell, "Boo!" Hiding, not to spare my
feelings, but because they know, the longer they wait, the greater my fear. 

I stood in the back yard of this haunted house and felt somewhat safe. It was a
normal back yard. Picket fence, sky and trees. A wide open space, not the dark
of night but the gray hours before dawn. I could see beyond the fence to fields
and a city beyond. I knew I wouldn't be trapped here, even if a ghost did pop
out of the ground. 

Then I turn and walk inside. Every detail was vivid and distinct. The rusty
creak of the back door. The strange wooden clatter as it slammed behind me. The
squeak of the boards under my feet. And the furniture doesn't looked like it was
burned in 1905. It looks like it was burned yesterday. Not completely. Just
enough to show you it was burned. The fire went out before it could do any real
damage. The house is cinged, but otherwise pristine. 

I walk through slowly and I know it's present-day. This place is a tourist
attraction now. I see a sign and a little plaque, and a shiny commercial toilet
in the back. Just another tourist trap somewhere in West Virginia. During the
day, this place would be filled with suburban travelers and screaming kids. But
no one ever comes here at night. In all the years since the Indians found the
place, no one has ever come here at night. 

My fear increases as I walk through the house. Through the den and the parlour
and the kitchen full of rusty things. I walk back to the bedroom and I know I'm
being watched. I'm too scared to walk down the hall. That's where the ghosts
are. In the bedroom, waiting for me. 

I turn around and run out the front door, seeking the comfort of 20th century
life. I look to the city, and it's too far. It's too far to run, over thistles
and rocks in bare feet. I can see office buildings and parked cars, but they're
too far away. And I didn't hear the front door slam behind me... 

And then Michael wakes up, jumps out of bed, turns on all the lights and says,
"Wow! That was really creepy. I should write this down before the feeling goes
away."

ChaosLAN - http://chaos.greeny.org/~chaoslan

Recently, Da_Toolman came to me and complained about the lack of traffic on the
LAN.  So, I am bringing forth a topic that should be debatable by all.  Is Bob
the Master of the World gay?

Most would right away say, of course not, look at what a pervert he is!  I mean,
my God, he talks about circle jerks all the time.  Therein lay the first clue.
Overcompensation.  He is so scared of admitting his true feelings, that he wants
to be overly boisterously heterosexual to make up for it.

Next clue:  Most of you have witnessed the afore-mentioned circle jerks.  Have
any of you ever taken the time to notice the look of pure ecstasy that he has in
his eyes when Oscar the Pornographer takes him from behind?  For those of you
who have noticed, then you have probably already wondered.

Please comment on this topic and for Bob tMotW, don't hate me for bringing you 
out of the closet.  Albeit with a gimp gag in your mouth...

To: <undisclosed recipients>

For Immediate Release, March 23, 1998

Technorealism Is Dead! Long Live TechoSurrealism!

Disinformation, the Subculture Search Engine, Presents The 'TechnoSurrealist
Manifesto,' by R.U. Sirius

Treatise Heralds New Disinfo.com Feature: 'A REVOLTING! Fireside Chat with R.U.
Sirius'

The Technorealism Conference held at Harvard on March 19, 1998 prompted spirited
debate near and far, here and there, hither and thither.  Now, in answer to the
Technorealism "manifesto" (www.technorealism.org), REVOLTING! executive editor
R.U. Sirius has penned the 'TechoSurrealist Manifesto,' available for mass
consumption at Disinformation (www.disinfo.com).

Surely a rant to stand alongside The Gettysburg Address, JFK's Berlin Wall
speech and that "Give me liberty or give me death" thing that the other guy
said, the TechnoSurrealist Manifesto skewers the Technorealism group's screed
with a considerably less "modest" proposal featuring hefty doses of satirical
mischief and revolutionary mayhem.

While existing perfectly well as a standalone document (much like The Bible!),
the 'TechnoSurrealist Manifesto' also marks the debut of the newest feature on
Disinformation, 'A REVOLTING! Fireside Chat with R.U. Sirius.'  Is he Sirius?
Is he for (sur)real? You'll just have to read it to find out.

R.U. Sirius is best known as co-founder and original Editor-In-Chief of Mondo
2000, the first cyberculture magazine.  His current website, REVOLTING!
(www.revolting.com) opened in mid-July 1997 to instant acclaim and controversy.
A regular columnist for Wired News, 21C, and EYE-COM, he also coauthored
'Design For Dying' with the legendary Dr. Timothy Leary (HarperEdge, June 1997).

Disinformation, the subculture search engine, is located at
http://www.disinfo.com.  Editor Richard Metzger is also the host of The Infinity
Factory webcast talk show on Pseudo Network at http://pseudo.com.
Disinformation is currently preparing for the opening of its online media store,
details of which will be announced shortly.  Disinformation is part of the RSUB
Network (http://www.rsub.com), a division of Razorfish.

Hi. The topic I was interested very much in pursuing is the topic concerning 
the obselescence of the Bulletin Board System. I think this is wrong and I am 
sad about it very much. For instance, take this Bulletin Board System, for 
example, entitled The Kingdom of Shit Bulletin Board System (or BBS for 
short). It is a vital communications nexus and it is very popular among the 
young and the old alike. It does not matter that it is not part of the 
so-called "Information Superhighway" that is being so widely talked of in 
today's mass media journals and such. It does not matter because it is a good 
place, and fun, to be, with friends, I think, and very personal, unlike The 
Internet which is big and large, with thousands of so-called "users."

Perhaps you yourself would care to contribute to this very important topic 
right here on this Bulletin Board System. That would be very good! Thank you.

The "Sysop."

        #####[ Programmed By: Bill Hooper - 1994 ]####################

-[Disclaimer]-
        You are using this program at your own risk. I claim no 
 responsibility for any damage that is inflicted on you computed or any data.
 If this file is in its original state, it is free of virii, destructive
 code, etc...

-[Introduction]-

        This is a VERY simple program that was written in a matter of approx.
 two hours, which was mostly typing. I had no real use for this program, 
 though boredom can cause people to do strange things. The only use I could
 think of might be in BBS ads, if you happen to like weird text..

-[How To Use This Program]-

        I seriously doubt anyone will have trouble comprehending the simple
 commands in this program. This is due to the fact that there are no command 
 line switches, and no real commands required. When the program asks you for 
 the name of the input file, enter the path name of the file you want to 
 konvert. The full path is not necessary for files in the same directory as
 the program. The output file is the name of the file that will contain the 
 konverted text. If any of these entries are invalid the program will tell
 you so, and terminate execution. 

-[Possible Errors]-

        The only errors I could think of would be the presence of extended
 ASCII in the input file. The program will just leave it out in the konverted 
 file. Can't think of any others, though if you find any, please e-mail me.

-[Conclusion]-

        I would appreciate e-mail regaring this program, and any suggestions
 that you might have. If you are going to e-mail me to tell me how much this
 program sucked and how it wasn't worth the 5 seconds to DL, va te faire 
 encouler. I can be reached at the following BBSs with some regularity.

[Static Line]       [Sysop: Acid Reptile]       [Phone: (806)747-0802]
[The Steel Zoo]     [Sysop: Ramslammer]         [Phone: (806)792-6377]

        Oh ya, almost forgot, you can't get rid of the little tag at the
 end of the file (unless you delete it), yet.

[This program will be available at http://www.GREENY.org/warez/warez.html
as soon as we get around to it.]

From: Doomed to Obscurity Productions <dto@Op.Net>
Subject: 
To: lobolicious@cyberdude.com

        Hi.  This letter is for everyone on the Doomed to Obscurity mailing
 list, because as you might have seen or heard, Doomed to Obscurity
 has undergone major evolution.  We now present to you DTO.NET central, at

        http://www.dto.net

        DTO began in the summer of 1995 as a text-based e-mail zine conceived
 by a handful of latent geeks from the Philadelphia, Chicago, and downstate
 Illinois areas.  Since then, 23 monthly issues have brought rave reviews and
 high acclaim from a very small pocket of the online community.  Because we
 believe that what we offer should be shared with as many people as we can
 reach, the text 'zine was converted into a web zine, with positive response.
 Now, we're taking the concept one step further.

        The types of writing that you have come to identify as DTO staples
 are still right here, divided into editorial, fiction, humor, and music
 sites.  Instead of monthly releases, DTO.NET central will be updated at
 least weekly.  Additionally, the site has been designed to encourage
 interaction between readers and writers.  DTO should no longer feel like a
 production released by a few geeks from who knows where.

        As before, you'll still receive a monthly text release of DTO
 containing all the articles featured on the website in the past month, in
 ASCII text format.  This means there's no *real* change for you on this
 list -- the purpose of this mail is just to inform you of the improved
 website and that DTO will now be releasing weekly articles there.

        Check out the site.  Hopefully, both the aesthetics and the content
 of the site will be appealing - after all, this is our goal.  We think we're
 doing a pretty damn fine job of achieving that goal, but let us know what
 you think about the change.  We'd appreciate any and all feedback.

        Thanks for being a DTO reader.  You should expect the long overdue
 DTO #24 in your mailbox this weekend.  Have a good vacation.

 - Mogel [dto@op.net]

Yeah, true.  And it sucks.  I mean, i understand that and all, but...
I've been thinking about priorities and what's real and stuff.
 
People NEED food and water and shelter.  And toothpaste.
ANYTHING people get beyond that, social or material or whatever, is like
a blessing/gift and oughta be appreciated for the fuzzy, neato thing that
it is.
 
Say, earlier Friday night... this band i was supposed to record cancelled so I'm
out some bucks 'till they can get their crap together and reschedule.  Some girl
doesn't like me.  And I have the fucking AUDACITY to feel down about this...
this FLUFF, 'cause big-fun-social-or-romantic things going on aren't just
LEAPING at me.  Well PLEASE excuse the world, Mr. Brat.  Sheez.  I should be

"Commercial firms enable subscribers using a computer and a telephone to send a
message to electronic bulletin boards; a person can thus post on the bulletin
board a message that is open to all subscribers.  This has led to so-called
electronic debates on religious matters.  A Christian might be drawn into such
debates and may spend many hours with an apostate thinker who may have been
disfellowshipped from the congregation.  The direction at 2 John 9-11
underscores Paul's fatherly counsel about avoiding bad associations."

"The Donkey and the Elephant" a "parable" by Priest (Pre-Election 2000)

    The question put to me sounds rather complicated.  "Considering the current
topics of debate by the two presidential candidates, which form of organization
of government do you believe is more apt to provide needed leadership in these
topics?"  In essence, what I plan to do is this-I will use planned actions for
issues by both candidates to show which form of organization will be the most
effective in the years to come for America.  I think that sounds much easier to
follow, with no slight of hand, or exaggeration on my part; we will leave that
to the candidates!
    First, the possible forms of organization for the government of the United
States of America.  "A confederacy is a union of states, which retain all
sovereignty.  The authority of the central government is derived from the states
which can, at will, redefine its authority."  (Patterson, The American
Democracy, pg. 60)  This basically says that in a confederacy, the states keep
all the power of government and no power rests at the national level; in other
words, no central government.
    A unitary system, by way of contrast, is the complete opposite.  "In a
unitary system, all regional and local governing units are subject to national
authority.   The people are citizens or subjects only of the national government
and the other governments derive their authority from the national government,
which can, in theory at least, abolish them or redefine their authority."
(Patterson, The American Democracy, pg. 60)  That seems pretty cut and dry in
that all power rests with the central government and the local or state
government retains no power except what the national government deigns to dole
out.
    And finally, we come to federalism, which is a blending of the two.
Patterson, once again, states the following, "Federalism is the division of
sovereignty, or ultimate governing authority, between a national government and
regional (that is, state) governments.  Each directly governs the people and
derives its power from them.  (Patterson, The American Democracy, pg. 59)  With
that taken care of, we move on to the candidates and their platforms.
    Since the donkey strikes first on the alphabet, we will discuss Al Gore
first.  The only issue we will discuss is education and the reason is this:
with what Gore wants to accomplish, only one form is usable, therefore rendering
the other two useless.  Gore wants to raise enormous amounts of money and use it
to hire more teachers and in doing so, lower the number of students per
classroom.  "Gore will finish the job of hiring one hundred thousand qualified
teachers to lower class sizes in the early grades...Gore's plan will provide
funding to help raise teacher salaries in school districts that commit to
improving teacher quality." (The Official Gore-Lieberman 2000 Website)  Since
Education is something that is currently handled at the state level, and since
Gore's new funding would be provided from a national standpoint, then clearly a
separation of power is needed.  Since neither is currently handled from just one
level or the other, then to change one or the other would be most unbeneficial.
From Gore's platform, only federalism will do the job.  Unitarianism, and
especially confederacy are simply not up to the task.
    George W. Bush makes our task even easier.  When concerning his plans for
the environment, he openly states his need for federalism.  "As President,
Governor Bush will maintain a strong federal environmental role but will return
significant authority to states and local governments."  (The Official
Bush-Cheney 2000 Website)  Governor Bush believes that the state governments
have a greater ability to enforce standards set by the national government.
However, without a strong national governmental role, the states would not be
required to enforce said standards.  One could not function without the other.
Once again, Unitarianism and Confederacy would not be up to the task.
    Although it is too late to make a long story short, I will try to briefly
summarize.  Of the three types of governments possible for the United States,
Unitarianism, Confederacy, and Federalism, only Federalism is the best and
therefore most likely choice for the future of America.  By the simple
examination of only one of each of the candidates' platform issues, we see that
each candidate requires strength at both the state and national level.  Only
Federalism has the necessary separation of powers.
    Federalism, the choice of a new millennium.

I was looking at the Zlog because IT IS NECESSARY TO TRY TO FILL THE VACANT 
YAWN AT THE DEAD CENTER OF MY LIFE, and discovered to my delighted melancholy, 
or melancholic delight, that on July 19th, 1994, there were fifty-three posts 
executed on the /<os. Fifty-three IN ONE SINGLE DAY. Man. What the FUCK was 
going on on July 19th? I wasn't even in town. I think I was in the wastes of 
British Columbia. WHY WERE THERE SO MANY POSTS? Was it 'cuz i was gone? Was 
there some controversy or argument or crazy ranting?

"Evil Corporations" by Jaffo

FIGHT THE EVIL, EXPANSIONIST MEGA-CORPORATIONS!

This is what I get for waking up too early on a Sunday morning.  I'm watching
CARTOONS.

And I just found ANOTHER cartoon where the brave, true of heart, Eco-Hero is
using his super-knifty power suit to FIGHT THE EVIL EXPANSIONIST MEGA
CORPORATIONS seeking to DESTROY THE ENVIORMENT in their EVIL pursuit of
BUSINESS and PROFITS!

OUR HERO has found a magical LEAF that can EAT POISON and suck up all the EVIL
POLLUTION that the EVIL EXPANSIONIST MEGA CORPORATIONS have spread through the
earth in their EVIL pursuit of BUSINESS and PROFITS!

We all know that all corporations are EVIL EXPANSIONIST greedy BASTARDS that
seek the destruction of our precious EARTH to further their own goals and earn
EVIL GREEDY CORPORATE PROFITS!

We all know that EVIL CORPORATE BASTARDS like BILL GATES run around setting fire
to rainforests and KICKING OLD PEOPLE IN THE GUT!

Then he smiles his EVIL GREEDY CORPORATE SMILE and runs away...LAUGHING!

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

"Soon,"  Bill says, "I will rule THE WORLD!  After I take over the PC SOFTWARE
MARKET I can proceed to my real goal of DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT!"

WaaaaaaaaaHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

Who can SAVE us from these evil, gr--  (oops)....these EVIL GREEDY CORPORATE
BASTARDS!?!

We must turn to our very own ECO HEROES!  We must call upon the mighty powers of
GOODNESS and DECENCY!

We must call WHOOPI GOLDBERG and TED DANSON to put on their knifty-Eco-Hero-
Power-Suits and FIGHT the (deep breath) EVIL GREEDY EXPANSIONIST CORPORATE
BASTARDS!

We must teach our children not to be swayed by offers of WEALTH and POWER. They
must persue honorable occupations like joining the PEACE CORPS or becoming
POLITCALLY CORRECT ECO-ACTORS!!!!!

This has been a public service announcement sponsored by the SOCIETY TO KEEP
EVIL GREEDY CORPORATE BASTARDS FROM DESTROYING THE ENVIORMENT!!!

(...and a grant from the epa)

END RIDICULOUS TIRADE

(Whew.  That was a lotta CAPS.  I'm so f*cking sick of these st00pid, badly
drawn, formula ECO CARTOONS that I could just PUKE.

And besides that, the air conditioner in my apartment is not working, so Jaffo
is HOT!!)

distributed exclusively through GwD]

******************************************************************************           
           **** Bill and Lobo's Hyper-Elite Programmers Guild ****
******************************************************************************
     
     The Guild was formed on October 20, 1994 during 'Administrative Cluster'
(Home Room) at Lubbock High School.  Lobo and Bill Hooper had just finished
the practice exit-level TAAS test (a lame test needed to graduate from HS).
Anyway, both being in Computer Science I, they decided to put their minimal
but ever-growing skills in TurboPascal (and Bill's knowledge of C++) to better
use than writing programs that convert Celsius to Fahrenheit or calculate the
price of a car.  Thus, the Guild was formed.  We have nothing better to do 
than sit around and program useless stuff during CS I, so we made a useless
stuff programmers group.  We are a union, in that we make $8.50 an hour 
(minimum of 4 hours work) for anything we do.  Of course, since we'll just be 
writing shareware programs, we'll probably never make any money, unless 
someone actually likes our stuff enough to pay the small registration fee, if 
there is one.  This isn't turning out to be a very good story.  Sorry.  As of 
now, the Guild is accepting no new members.  Maybe later......

If you want to know anything more, please fell-free to ask Lobo or Bill.  If
you're lucky, we might just get around to answering.  Heh.

     This is an advertisement for the Guild.  Simply type 'guildad' at the 
main prompt, and you will be looking at the advertisement.  Please note that
the ASCII version is longer than one screen, so for the full effect, you might
want to choose the 'print' option instead of the screen option.  However, if
you don't have your printer on you'll get a 'runtime' error.  If this happens,
turn on the printer and re-execute the program.  Hell, you should choose the 
'print' option, if only to make posters!  Put them up all over town!  Yeah!
(Bill and Lobo's Hyper-Elite Programmers Guild officially exempts itself from 
any costs or fees to pay for cleanup of posters bearing our name.)  Anyway, 
plase be on the lookout for releases from the Guild in the near future.

--------------------
DISCLAIMER:  This advertisement should be run on a 386 or higher or the Memory 
             Expansion Utility (MemConfig) will take a hell of a long time to

Jersey, and that medicine is SLACK.
        -- J. R. "Bob" Dobbs
........
        This file will help you test your Slack level.  Originally a text file
by Bill White, I have coded it into the handy-dandy test you have before you.
This is what Mr. White had to say before his version of the test:
........
        The following is a short little test that will effectively measure
how much slack you have.  If you find yourself in excess, please send some
to Ohio University; the poor fools who run this place wouldn't know an
original thought if it bit them in the crotch.
........
Disclaimer (by Bill White): I disclaim everything.  In fact, I don't exist.  
                            So there.  Nyah.
........
Disclaimer (by Lobo): I am not responsible for any of the results of YOU 
                      taking this test.  If you actually expect it to tell you
                      something, you are too pink to worry about.
........

This ZIP File should include:

FILE_ID.DIZ
SLACK.DOC
SLACK.EXE
SCORES.SLK
........
        _DO NOT_ delete the scores file.  It is needed for the program to run
properly.
........
        I know I'm probably going to get a lot of crap from people saying that
this file is the work of a Pinkie Normal.  Well, I'll save you the trouble. 
I am a Pinkie Normal.  Who else would have nothing better to do on a saturday
night but write a stupid little test program?  The thing is, I do have a 
minute amount of Slack, but I can't waste it, not even on a Slack Test.
........
"I dunno, I printed it
out and smoked it!:     Congratulations, you have slack.  Now give me your
                        money anyway." -Bill White
........
Well, there you have it.  SlackQuiz.  Send me five bucks for registry.  Or 
don't.

-[ Disclaimer ]-
 
 Neither the author, Bill and Lobo's Hyper-Elite Programmers Guild, or 
 Genocidal Warez are responsible for any damage this software might cause
 to your system. Any loss of data through program malfunction, virus attack, 
 or other such means are not the responsibility of those listed above.
 There is no purposefully malignant code in the original exe.

-[ What Is The F___ing Censor ? ]-

 Like most of my programs, this one was written out of boredom. I had nothing
 to do, and had gotten in trouble before for objectionable language present
 in text files I had been reading. To solve this problem, I created The
 F___ing Censor. This program loads a file, and censors all words present in
 that file that are also present in the specified word list.

-[ Directions ]-

 I don't know why I am writing this section, because the entire program is
 command line, and if you can't get the directions from the program, give 
 up. 

-[ Creating A Word List ]-

 As a default, The F___ing Censor will load the words present in the file
 WORD.LST . If you feel you need more/less words in the list, make sure you
 change the number at the top of the file to the number of words in the  
 list! 

-[ Bugs ]-

 There are a few bugs present in this program that I have knowledge of, but
 either don't care enough to fix, or have any idea how to fix.
 
 - At the beginning of the output, there will be some garbage in the text. I
   figure this is some memory crap, and I have tried a bunch of stuff to get
   rid of it, but to no avail. No biggie, just edit the censored file.

 - The program WILL SCREW on very large files! I guess this is also some damn
   memory problem, and don't know how to get rid of it.

 - You MUST remove ALL headers, text drawings, etc... from the inputted tfile.
   The F___ing Censor takes individual words from the inputted file, censors,
   and writes to the output. The maximum length of a word is 20 characters!
   If anything goes over that, it will only take 20 chars, and put the rest
   in a new word.  I could easily fix this, though I really don't care about 
   this small bug.. It is easy to get around... I might fix it on a later 
   version..

 - Sometimes, you will get a Abnormal Program Termination error. I have no
   Freaking idea why this happens, so I guess I will leave it in.. It doesn't
   make much of a difference in output though, so it shouldn't bother you..

 - During testing, I have found that many files contain hidden characters. I
   don't know why you can't see them, or how they get there, but they some-
   times appear in the output.

-[ Notes ]-
 
 - Only 100 words are allowed in the word list.
 
 - Words in the word list must be smaller than 20 characters.

-[ Registry ]-

 - The F___ing Censor costs $3.00 to register.  If you register, you get the
   complete version minus most of the bugs.  This is definitely worthwhile.

-[ Closing ]-

 We at Bill And Lobo's Hyper Elite Programmers Guild, and Genocidal Warez 
 DO NOT condone censorship. We feel that it is an infringement on the basic
 freedom of speech. This program is merely a tool for the uses listed above.
 Don't gripe at us. We don't want to listen to your philosophical tirades 
 about how bad this program is.

[Notice]

        This program is to be distributed is its original format only. The 
author is not responsible for any damage or loss of data resulting from use
of this program.

[Introduction]
        
        This program is designed for use by those who have been assigned 
wordsearch puzzles as homework and wasted valuable time doing something that
wouldn't help them anyway. You can also use this program for those wordsearch
puzzles that are just too hard too figure out. I really wrote this program
too late for my use, though I hope I can save others the hours of headache
that I have encountered due to wordsearch puzzles.

[Description Of The Program]

        The Easy WordSearch Assistant v.01 is a small, yet powerful tool in
the completion of word search puzzles. All that the user is required to do is
to enter the puzzle into a text file, and after inputting the word that s/he
would like to find read its location off the screen and write it down. This
program finds words quickly and efficiently.

[Instructions]

        To Use This Version, You Must Have ANSI.SYS Loaded !!

        Before using this program, you must first type the entire wordsearch
puzzle in a text file. An example of a large wordsearch puzzle is included  
to assist you in creating one correctly. The name of this file is PUZZLE.DAT.
The only important factor in typing a wordsearch puzzle is to remember not
to press enter more than one time after the last line. 
        
        Example:  agbdfwergasaweraerd
                  aadsbbxzcdfasdggasd <---- Last Line Of Puzzle, Press CR ONCE
                  
        You should have no trouble if you use a program such as dos edit
to create the file.
        After have started the program, enter the filename of the puzzle you
have inputted. The program should then display the contents of the file, or
tell you that it is too large to be used. If the file is too large, you must
do one of two things, split the file up and do it sections at a time(a pain 
that I will not describe the method of approaching), or contribute money and 
recieve a registered version that will return the coorinates of the first
letter, and tell you the direction of the rest of the word. If you have 
entered an invalid filename, the program will tell you so, and quit. If 
all goes well, you will be presented with the prompt for the search string,
which is the word that you are looking for. After you type it in, press enter.
If the program finds the word, it will highlight it on the display of the 
puzzle, and allow you to exit by pressing escape, or continue by pressing 
enter. If the string isn't found, the program will tell you so, and give you 
the same choices.
       You can also exit the program by pressing enter at the "Search String>"
prompt. 

[Errors]

        If garbage is displayed on screen, it means you don't have ANSI.SYS
loaded. I am not going to waste my time creating a verison just for people
with out ANSI.SYS. I can't think of any other errors that might occur, if 
you find any, please tell me.

[Closing]

        You can register this program if you like, or just leave it as it
is. I really don't plan to make a lot of money, though if you would like the
information necessary to register this small utility, e-mail me and I will
send it to you. I would appreciate any comments that you have about this 
program, thanx.

ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍµBy Bill HooperÆÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ1/4
  
                             

-[ Disclaimer ]-

        I the author, do not hold myself resposible for any damage inflicted
 on your system by the use of this program. None of the code in the program
 is made to be destructive, and in the original zip, the exe's should be 
 virus free. This disclaimer also applies to Bill And Lobo's Hyper Elite
 Programmer's Guild and all its members. Bill And Lobo's Hyper Elite 
 Programmer's Guild is an equal oportunity employer.
 
-[ !!! NOTE !!! ]-
               
        This is the real release. It has all the multi user stuff, system
 reconfig, etc...

-[ Introduction ]-

        Through my searches for a password program to safeguard my computer
 from those who I'd rather not allow access to the data present, I have found
 no real program that meets all my needs. Most did the normal two to four 
 users supported, and a simple password request with a lock if the attempt
 was incorrect. Nowhere did I find a program that could create a log of the
 users of the computer, and data specific to their logons. I never found
 a program that had the capability of directing different users to different
 areas of a system. To satisfy these needs, I wrote Disk Access.

-[ What Is Disk Access? ]-

        Disk Access is a program that functions much the same way as a 
 password program, but all user input for passwords is substituted by using
 a special access disk for each user. This method removes the hassle of 
 typing in a password every time you start up, but still allows you the 
 security of a password protected system.

-[ How Does Disk Access Work? ]-

        This version of the program will create a file in the root directory
 called DISK.IXX . There is a replica of this file on your access disk. On 
 boot, the program checks to see if these files are alike, if so, you are
 granted access, if not, well, kind of obvious.. This is a simple method
 and will most likely change in the next version of this program.

-[ Getting Up And Running ]-

        The first item of business if to create an access disk for your 
 system. To do this, use the MDISK.EXE utility, that should be included in
 the original zip. The program will first ask you the drive you wish the 
 access disk to be created on. With this version, only drive A and B are
 supported. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE INSERTED THE DISK AT THIS TIME! I didn't 
 bother to put any code to check for a disk in, and it will screw if you
 don't have one in the drive. Next, enter your name. Finally, you will be 
 asked to enter some random text. This is the string that the program will
 check both disks for. To my knowledge, any text (letters, numbers, extended
 ascii,etc..) should work. The more akward this string is, the better the
 security. The string should be less than 30 characters! Also, you have to
 enter the SL, wich is quite self explanatory. The utility will then make 
 the disk, and needed files. Now, you are ready to run..

-[ Using Disk Access ]-

        The use of Disk Acces is quite simple, when the program asks you
 for your access disk, put it in the drive! All logs of system use are 
 written to DISKA.LOG . This file has the possiblity of getting quite large,
 and it is encouraged that you delete it every week or so..

-[ Multi User System Reconfig ]-

        Included is a sample batch file that will run disk access, and 
 according to the exit code, which is the user's SL, it can do different 
 things. I really don't feel like writing a lot about this, because it is
 self explanatory. Remember to put the SLs in the batch file in DESCENDING
 order.

-[ Trouble Shooting ]-

       Q: The Program Doesn't Recognize My Access Disk.
       A: Try running the make disk util again. If that doesn't work, use
          another disk. If that doesn't help, e-mail us...

       Q: The Batch Runs The Incorrect Statements For A Certain SL.
       A: Make Sure The SL's Are In Descending Order.

-[ Conclusion ]-

        If you want support of more than 99 users, you must register, e-mail
 me if you plan to. This is the real version, with all the neat features.. 
 There should not be too many releases after this one though, actually, 
 there might be one in the near future, due to a small problem I just 
 thought of..

-[ Registry ]-

        Please register Disk Access.  Many hours of work went into this  
program.  We can only improve our programming skills through taking courses or 
buying books.  We need money to do either of these.  Better programming skills
means better programs.  So, it's for you that we want your money.  Besides,
if you register, you get K-Rad Klock v.01 absolutely free.  So please 
register.  Thanks.

 There is no purposefully malignant code in the original exe.

-[ What Is The Quick Label ? ]-

 The Quick Label is a small utilitie, that is usefull for adding headers
 and footers to numerous files, or one at a time.  This program originated
 from the need for text file labels for t-file groups, and for our 
 programming group.

-[ Directions ]-

 The Quick Label is completely command line. The format is as follows :

         LABEL.EXE <Switch> <Label File> <File 1> <File 2> <etc ....

 Valid Switches -     B - Label At Begining Of File
                      E - Label At End Of File

 Only one of the switches can be applied at one time! I guess the file list
 can be as long as you want, though I have only tested it with about 3 or 4
 files. The label file must be in the current directory, or I guess you can
 give the complete path, just keep it in the current directory to save you
 and me a pain in the rear. Wildcards are NOT valid!

-[ Known Bugs ]-

 If an invalid file is specified in the file list, at the begining or end,
 a Null Pointer Assignment will be displayed. I don't care about this error,
 and do not plan on fixing it, as most people are smart enough to put in
 valid filenames. If you find any bugs on your own, PLEASE e-mail us, or
 get in touch.

-[ Future Versions ]-

 Future versions might include wild card capabilities, besides that.... no
 real plans.

-[ Closing ]-

-[ Introduction ]-

 This program, like many others, was written by me during computer science at
 school.. If you don't like it, I really don't care.. If you do like it, a
 $5 money order is worth a thousand words :)...

-[ What Is The Warez Writer ]-

 The warez writer is a small utility that will transform the contents of any
 text file into the popular W@R3Z writing.

-[ Instructions ]-

 The use of this program is pretty streight foreward, when it asks you for
 the name of the input file, input the name of the plain text file. Next,
 enter the name of the file you would like the warez text to be written to..
 I think they can be the same, if you want...maybe..

-[ Bugs ]-
 
 I've run into this stupid hidden character thing on 2 programs now, and
 have no idea how to fix it... Sometimes a txt file will have a couple of
 hidden binary characters in it that will screw with the output.. this 
 doesn't happen often, don't worry.. Other than that none known currently.. 
 might screw on big files, don't know for sure though.

-[ To Register ]-

 right choice. Fill out the included form, and mail to:

"LUBBOCK FUCKING SUCKS!" by Some Old School BBSer
[we think one of the FUCK guys wrote this]

        Welcome to this file called "Lame BBSes In Lubbock And The Community.  I
 wrote this because I was getting pissed off at BBSing lately.  This file is
really only for Lubbock, so if your outta the state or something, read and
delete it, I don't care.  First, I think everybody thinks that they can run a
board of there own.  Not true.  Boards are only supposed to be GOOD, I guess,
you could say.  If I describe your board, then you should be shot.

-->If your board has less the 7 message subs, take it down.
   There is a couple of boards I know that have 5 and 3.  On the board that has
   3, one of them always dead, because only certain people can post on them
   (Sysops....).  Get a life, you guys....

-->If you message bases are not filled to the max yet (i.e.-5o or 1oo) and your
   board is over 2 months old, take it down!!!  There is one board I am on that
   has about 22 message subs and not ONE has there's filled up, xcept ONE.
   Pretty pathetic.

-->If you have 3 Ka-zillion files, that's cool.  But not if nobody D/L's them.
   Pretty sad, you take up good megage.  Look and see if you have lots o' files,
   and see how many people actually like them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
i think you get the point now.  These are just some of the reasons that Boards
are lame and stupid.  If you're a sysop, take a look and see if your board
matches this.
        If you're one of those Sysop's that say "Well, I get 25 callers a day"
that's pretty good, but if all they do is play your screwed all to hell Trade
Wars and leech your neat-o groovy .GIFS, get a life. I understand that many
people don't have big HD's.  (Like 40 Megs) Running a board takes some space,
and I don't think you should run a board with 40 megs.

Now, to the users.  Most of these people are pissing me off.  Now, this is just
my opinion and, really, a lot of people I talk to.  For instance, if your board
has NOTHING but message, after message of sexual sentences, get a FUCKING
life!!!!!!!  I hate going through the N-scan and reading "Only if you can catch
me!!!!!" and "I'm too hot for you too handle!!!"

Geez guys....Oh, and another thing...stop this damn <G>, <BESG>, and
<EGEGERYEDADSFSWF> thing!!!!!  If in all your messages you have that in there,
you will notice you're full of crap.  People laugh at your posts.  If you call a
"sophisticated" board, you might not post, but you will see there is no <G> and
shit like that.

        There is also, A lot of talk about illegal drugs on the boards.  This is
perfectly fine, since the 1st amendment is in effect.  But, some people may cuss
you out and say to stop calling and shit like that, and that's okay, i guess.
Then some people threaten you and all that shit...Look, people, if you are
pissed off at somebody, don't yell at them and all that shit, if it's just
you...don't call back.  If it's a lot of the regular users that call that board,
tell the Sysop, since he runs it!!!  w0w....big concept, meatheads!!!  The sysop
is in charge of the board, so he should be the only one saying something about
it.

There is many thing on my mind about these people that _suck_ and those BBSes
that aren't worth a _flip_.  Everyone, get a LIFE!!!!!!!!!  This only pertains
to Lubbock, so you cool guys that don't live in Lubb., just laugh at this phile.
Anyway, I just got off a board and this is what provoked me.  3 message bases
(Sysop thinks gamez rule the world, has a bunch o' them), and the posting was
all about "sexual" crap with <G> and <BSEG> and every other shitty <?> thing
that goes.  I really hang out on the "Underground" and "sophisticated" boards,
where there's a decent conversation going on.

RECAPP-=-=-=-board-if your board has 30-50 megs, 3 message bases, shitty files
or people running around saying "I want it...hard!!", burn your 'puter.

Users---If you say sexual stuff on all your posts, look around....you're having
a conversation with 1 or 2 other people!!!  If you say <G> and all that shit and
only slam and game....burn you.

That's it...I feel better.  Not really.  I havta go U/L this now to all shitty
boards.  Sysop's better be lucky that I didn't name names, because everybody
would read this and say "That board sucks...I'll never call it again."  I hope
some people have at least a little discussion about this file and really
understand it.

Thank You.

"People I'm Tired Of" by Jaffo, 03-09-01

I sat with a couple casual friends from the UP tonight. Five minutes into this,
I realized that I have lost my last bit of affection for geek culture. 

I used to write fondly about these guys. I used to be one of them. Now, through
no fault of their own, they have exceeded my tolerance. 

Do you talk about computer hardware for fun? 

Do you reference Star Trek episodes in casual conversation? 

Do you have long-winded debates about compression schemes? 

Do you get sexually aroused with a girl admits to playing video games? 

Do you brag about the new pirated software on your machine? 

Do you brag about the size of your MP3/DVD collection? 

Do you quote sexually explicit comedy bits from mp3.com? 

If you do any of these things, I'm tired of you. I don't hate you. I don't think
you're stupid. I wish you wealth, happiness, and joy. I'm just tired of you. 
I'm not better than you. I used to be one of you. Every so often, I can slip
back into the geek mindset and genuinely enjoy a discussion about CD Burners and
MP3 players. But not tonight.

I'm in FL now, in the machine room at the OSC, waiting for Digital Support to 
call me back.. their VAX is in such unbelieveable shape its hard to imagine.  
Somebody put 64 megs in it one day (bringing it from 16 to 80 megs) but didnt 
bother to configure or even try to tune the vax..so its a 80M machine that 
runs like 16.  Heh.  So I go in and try to tune the blasted thing (so it will 
stop crashing every weekend from lack of resources..) and that breaks 
disk-shadowing.  So whomever set up the shadow sets didnt do that right, 
because the params im adjusting dont affect shadowsets, so they've missed a 
step in the config file somewhere... grr.  i dont know enough about their 
shadowing to mess with that, so im waiting for digital to cal...

the whole week has been a blur of equipment failures and training errors.  

but oh well.

Like i said in email, you should definately come visit once we get an apt or 
house or something.  hopefully tomorrow i'll go hunting for apts.   i hate
doing that.  very annoying.

guess i'll go hang out on the BBS now, eh... good luck in CHIcago, sounds like
a fun trip.  go for it.

"The Geekiest Apartment Around" by Seth The Man

01.24.2000 01:50:23 PM: If there was ever any doubt before, let there be no
more. Our apartment is now the geekiest on the block, nay, the geekiest this
side of Tech. We have a rack cabinet in our den. I spent most of last night
getting redhat on a little dx80 box that Hal and I built just so I could run
cmatrix and get that funky-cool green scrolling letters thing going on the box.
Now I've just got to figure out how to get a multi-headed version running on all
those old monitors Hal has lying around.

Mr. Carter,

Although we do not operate the DefensiveDriver.com business, we do maintain it
from a technical standpoint. Content issues are handled by the folks at
DefensiveDriver.com. You can email them at info@defensivedriver.com. However, I
can answer this question for you since I was intimately involved with the
writing of this course.

On the issue of centrifugal force vs. centripetal force, I cannot argue the fact
that centrifugal force does not really exist. However, there are two reasons for
our use of centrifugal rather than centripetal. I'm sure neither of the reasons
will completely satisfy you, but I do want you to be aware that this has been
discussed both internally and with the Texas Education Agency (TEA). The first
reason is that centrifugal force is a commonly used term and is readily
recognized by the average person. Also, although it is technically incorrect it
is more easily explained to people who have not had the benefit of higher
education. Unfortunately, I believe it is still taught in our primary education
system. The second reason is more important to us as an approved course. It is
included in the Rules for Driving Safety Courses as required content. We have
to address it as a physical force that effects driving. The only way to change
it would be to get the rules changed by the TEA.

As for the grammatical mistake, again you are correct. Obviously, it is a simple
typographical error and we will correct it.

Thank you,
Mark Macdonald

It's no wonder the Exalted Lords of the Cosmos refuse to let Earth people into 
their neat tree houses and forts and Secret Clubs and all. Cuz we're stupid 
and smell funny and we evolved from even dumber looking protohuman ape things 
like had hairy butts and fucked in the open and sniffed shit all the time. 
Man. And maybe the Space Lords thought that as our morphology "evolved," so
would our brains and all, but man, 3 or 4 million yrs. later, we're
just as stupid, and still obsess about body hair and the size of the shit that 
hangs between our legs and get a chuckle out of (or worse yet, politicize) the 
stuff that we excrete, and AHHHHHHH, geez. It's embarrassing to live on a 
planet that's probably regarded by the space people as sorta the solar
system's State School.

"Tastes Like Suicide" by Seth The Man

Ya'll 'scuse me if I've touched the sky and I scorn the earth. I'm bitter,
depressed and lonely. Not the most complementary human emotions, but I didn't
choose to feel this way. Fuckin' chemicals in my head decided they wanted to be
a little unbalanced, and so here I am. Crying in my pillows, blasting my
eardrums with compressing air waves of electronic genesis.
Walkawaywalkawaywalkaway. So, do you know what tears taste like? Not the salt
water droplets that stream out of the eyes. That's base. No. The taste that a
really evil cry can leave in the back of your throat. It's almost just the salt
of tears, but it touches into something more. A little sweetness to go with the
pain-a little something more than yer head leak's au-natural seasoning.
Firefire. Let it burn. Like mi corazon. Broken heart my ass. Breaks are
momentary, something to be done with, then set back into place. My heart is
roasting into dust. Slow Burn. Ash to season the tears. A little charred meat
with my sweetness.  Hmm. Some soul in there too. Heart n' Soul stew. Chew. Chew.
Grind. Hold your tongue down, breathe the savor. Bury me beneath the Damage and
the Dust. So how long does this taste last? How much pain can der zunge
remember? I'm sure it has something to do with how much you scream, `cause I can
feel it receding with my echoes. I need somebody to shove.  So how long has it
lasted so far? Hard to count. How many tears fell? Does the taste compound by
the quantity, or is it just the quality of  today that really brings it out?
Quantity or Quality? ¨Volumen o Clase? Head full of lice and a mouth full of
drink. And I'll never find what I'm not looking for. Ya'll `scuse me if I've
touched the sky and I scorn the earth.

-=[ What Are GEncrypt and GDecrypt? ]=-

 GEncrypt (pronounced jenn-crypt) is a text file encrypter.  It does nothing
 more than put text into a format that is unreadable.  GDecrypt puts text files
 back in the original format and makes text readable again.

-=[ Directions ]=-

 Simply run GENCRYPT.EXE from the command line (or File Manager, for you Windows
 users).  I am too lazy to figure out how to make the program accept file names
 from the command line, so simply supply the file names the program asks for.
 When the program has encrypted your text, you need to write down your five
 digit decrypt key number.  To decrypt, simply run GDECRYPT.EXE and provide the
 file names and the decrypt key number and your text file will return to its
 original state.  Do not encrypt or decrypt files onto themselves.  You will get
 an error message, and I see no need to try to fix this minor "bug".

-=[ Note ]=-

 DO NOT USE GENCRYPT ON BINARY FILES.  It will convert them to text and when
 they are decrypted, they will remain text and will not be usable.

"Disk Bomb" by The Talon

The disk bomb is a wonderful way to get back at a person you just can't stand,
one who constantly asks for games, etc.

Materials:1 diskette
2 blue-tip matches
Clear nail polish

Procedure:  Carefully crush the heads of the blue-tip matches (they must be
blue-tip or this will not work!) into powder.

Mix the powder to be sure all of the blue igniting chemical that the matches are
treated with is mixed in.  Spread this powder very thinly on the surface of the
disk inside the read/write access hole.

Carefully pour a very small amount of the nail polish on the powder and spread
it out on the disk surface in the read/write access oval.  Wait about an hour
for the nail polish to dry.  Turn the inside of the disk so that the powder
mixture is not seen.  Give the disk to the intended victim.

If this is done properly, within 30 sec of boot-up, the friction caused by the
spinning diskette will ignite the powdered sulfur.  The burning sulfur will then
ignite the plastic diskette, melting it, causing a great mess inside the
victim's drive.

Man.  I just don't like most porno's.  If I wanted to see a big hairy dick 
pumping something, I'd keep my eyes open while fucking my wife.  If I'm gonna 
get a porno, it has to be something I've never seen before, like chicks fucking
appliances, or each other, or food, or at least something vaguely interesting.

The woman walks in, sucks man, man fucks her one way, flips her over, cums on 
her butt, and leaves shtick is pretty old.

I don't know.  I'm just bored with normal sex.  You get burned out.  I'd rather
watch alien sex or bestiality, or something different.  After a while, all
boobs, vaginas, etc. begin to look the same.

I see people going to titty bars, porno places, etc. and wonder why they aren't
home nailing their wives if they're so horny.

Nope, I guess I'll have to feebly fill in.

'b0b' or 'BOB' is short for J.R. "Bob" Dobbs, High Epopt of the Church of the 
SubGenius. If you are not SubG, you are 'normal.' You are 'Pink.' In short,

Nonono, you do not worship 'Bob.' He's just a prophet of what is to come. But 
he can Save you. He can give you Slack that will allow you to deal with 
anything the Conspiracy and the Elder Bankers throw at you.

You can get the Official Church Scriptures at Hastings (Book of the Subgenius,
Revelation X, Three Fisted Tales of Bob, etc), and you can give me a couple of
bucks, and I'll make you a big ol' Slack-Pack of stuff that I've made and

Licious,

    I am disgusted by what I read of Only Tomorrow.  How could you change the
"modern day Messiah" line?  That's the best part in the whole thing.

And I think because of my work there that I should be given the title "Spanish
Propagandist", being lower in status to the full-time Propagandists.  Also, we
need to look into the establishment of a GwD inquisition, which would ferret out
the supporters of Redd amongst the Droogian populace.  I would head this as the
Inquisitor General and receive orders directly from the Spiritual Commandant.
Also, we must begin to prepare for July 5, 1998, when GwD's control over the
Earth will be complete (see Only Tomorrow).  Once this happens, the minions of
BOb Limekiller will run rampant and it will only be through the redoubled
efforts of our Inquisition that they will be stopped from causing random
mischief.

I have spoken.

At HoHoCon a couple years back, some dorkballs claimed to be hackin'
into forbidden cyberspace, rooting around for info on UFO's. Fuck those weiner
dogs. Okay, so hacking and systems' intrusion isn't really a strong suit among
us /<osers; so what? Just cuz we're parochial incompetents doesn't mean we
can't TRY to discover the mysteries of the unknown encrypted in this digital
disneyland.

So, how about those of us who give a shit about UFOlogy-- and really, about
the paranormal in general-- try to figure stuff out. Consider /<os a rolling
colloquium on high weirdness and the really far out. Anyone with any sorts of
hacking skills ought to email me, and we'll discuss our options. People with
relavant files ought to upload 'em. Maybe everyone'll find a little relief
from that nagging existential bellyache by focusing on the external and
transcendent for a change.

I'm sick of Big Concepts. I'm sick of Cleverness. I'm sick of arrogant

bullshit innundating so-called subculture, sick of seeing the same old

stupidity. I'm sick of wanting things for myself than I despise other

angry cuz i can't convince anyone of anything. I'm sick of being
ineffectual. I'm sick of whining cuz i'm inactive and uninvolved. I'm

Here's a concept.

In a silent basement in the land-locked bowels of America there's an
anonymous little pc that hums away lightless hours. It calls itself the
kingdom of shit. It's where loneliness comes from.

It's run at 1200 baud, a sad, archaic speed. It's few users stumble
dully through vacant, dusty subboards, groping in the halflight of their
vdt's, tacking up terse requests for contact. Everyone wants to know
where anyone is. The pc's cpu silently calculates its billion loneliness
algorithms every second, and the bbs's data base fills with digitized
confusion, and disorientation, and loneliness. Everything comes from
somewhere. This is where loneliness enters the cybernet.

The kingdom of shit may be vast, a storehouse of unused megs, like
great, cyber-warehouses lit by flickering flourescent tubes; miles and
miles of empty warehouse space. Or maybe not. The sysop's never
available. Rumor has it he died years back. The bbs seldom crashes, and
it's revival is mysterious and abrupt when it does. They say the line (a
number somewhere in the texas plains) is sometimes busy for days, but
when a caller finally gets through, there's no appreciable difference.
No posts. A list of previous callers who never leave a word, a reason or
intention or hope or fear for their calls. There's no xfers... nothing
to attract the somber legions of wares pirates. Just those creaky old
sub-boards, and a few hopelessly out of date messages from lost users,
callers from years back, set adrift like messages in a bottle, adrift on
a digital ocean. They say loneliness comes from here. That the bbs
phones thousands of systems a year, inserting viruses, or subtly
manipulating machine code. Seeding the cyberplains with loneliness. The
kingdom of shit is like a Johnny Appleseed of despair, mindless, it's
coded instructions mirthlessly and mysteriously executed. It's
intentions are unclear, a matter of conjecture. And who conjectures?
Only a few. Some of the zombies who wander the empty Kingdom's halls. A
few old men who've thought deeply and alone about Conditions and their
Meanings. Maybe a hebephrenic or two, wandering the midsummer, midnight
streets in the great cities of America, murmuring the word 'alone,' or
challenging passing cars with a fearful growl: "Kingdom of shit!"

      girls, is suffering from anorexia or bulimia. Pressures to "look
      thin" come from all directions, including parents, siblings, and
      friends. These peer pressures cause some girls to form the
      disorders of anorexia or bulimia in hopes of losing weight to
      please those who pressure them. Unfortunately, many times this
      chain of events has a sad and devastating effect on everyone, as
      the repercussions from anorexia and bulimia can be as severe as
      death.

               Based on the research I have conducted thusfar, it is clear
      that there are solutions to avoiding this tragedy. While family and
      friends can often times unwillingly be one of the causes, they also
      hold the power save those who have fallen into the traps of anorexia
      and bulimia. Parents can take heed of any warning signs that their
      daughter might be in danger. Also, parents can actively remind their
      children that they do not need to lose weight to win family approval.
      Friends can also aid in recovery, because they can provide peer
      acceptance without the pressures of "looking thin" as well as
      understanding and supporting those who suffer from anorexia and
      bulimia in their time of need. It is my belief, based on my current
      level of research, that family and friends can be major benefactors
      to the recovery process of those who struggle against anorexia and
      bulimia.

since you asked, and I'm feeling generous, and it doesn't look like I'll be
seeing ya anytime soon to show it in person, here's the famous Flaming Dairy
Creamer trick...take a normal restaurant-size pack of creamer (Taco Bell creamer
works _real_ good) and open it....hold it about a foot or so over your head and
away from your body. Hold a lighter positioned directly underneath at about
mid-chest level (Zippos work good because you don't have to try and light them,
you can start with them lit)...sprinkle the creamer so that it makes a cloud
(It's really fine, so this shouldn't be too hard). When the cloud touches the
flame from the lighter....
>FWOOSH< Firecloud! Don't try this in the restaurant unless you're willing to
get banned for life.....although the look on waitresses' faces is unforgettable.

and remember...I didn't tell you how to do this...you figured it out on your
own...and nothing can be traced back to me.

1) halloween is so beautiful....lotsa teenage girls dressed up like
   dominatrixes.  the only downside is you gotta be extra careful to check their
   gender.

2) my eyes itch like a witch's tit.  I'm gonna go drip lubricants into them.

3) it's better to just be a good samaritan and give the porn to poor kids who
   can't afford their own.

4) You are like so many cattle led by a blind man.

5) i've got naked girls, and you're not getting any!

6) i've not been using irc much anymore because i decided everyone I met there
   SUCKS ASS.

7) so basically, you just spend all day looking at old lady porno?

8) i hate mp3.  it makes my crash cymbals sound all swimmy in the high
   frequencies.

whole lot in funky colors and alternated between caps and lowercase randomly. 
then, i turned it into a GwD add, cuz that's what i do.  i try to make light of
my situations by replacing 'angst' with 'GR33NY lik3s mash3d p0tat03s', which, 
coincidentally is one of the quotes on the GwD web page.

  ========================================================
  STATEMENT CONCERNING POLICE ACTION ON INTERNET PROVIDERS
  ========================================================

    PLEASE DISTRIBUTE FREELY

The Hong Kong Government has once again exposed itself and the territory's
reputation to international ridicule with Friday's raids against and
shut-down of seven Internet suppliers.

The raids not only severed links to the Internet and international E-mail for
up to 10,000 companies and individuals without warning, but they also
indicate a complete breakdown in communication between two government
departments, the Police Commercial Crime Bureau (CCB) and the Office of the
Telecommunications Authority (OFTA).

In this regard the following points must be raised and will be discussed at a
press conference and open forum on Monday March 6. This event is planned to
be held at the Foreign Correspondents Club at 3PM, however this venue has yet
to be confirmed. Confirmation of venue and time can be obtained by calling
(852) 2866-6018 on Monday morning.

- The raids were carried out by the computer crime division of the CCB
  accompanied by officials from OFTA for unlicensed provision of
  telecommunications services by the seven companies.

- OFTA, as the governing body in such cases, had been carrying out its own
investigation into the same issues and had already entered into discussions
with all the affected providers.

- OFTA has issued a statement saying that it had not initiated the raids and
was only providing technical support. It also says the raids were a result of
a police investigation into "commercial crimes involving computer hacking."

- No mention of computer hacking has ever been made by police either in their
search warrants, charges or subsequent statements to the press.

- Eight people were arrested during the raids and detained for questioning on
issues related to providing a telecommunications service without a license.

- Never was any supplier warned that they would be raided and charged with an
offense.

- Despite working together it seems that OFTA and the police never actually
  talked about the two coinciding investigations. In any case OFTA has
  wrongly, and possibly purposely, led the providers into believing they
  were on firm ground, knowing full well that a raid was imminent.

- OFTA in a letter dated January 19 asked all providers for details of their
services and equipment. The letter said that after the investigation was
complete OFTA would advise the companies on licensing requirements and
procedures.

- OFTA had verbally told some providers that their services were not in
  danger until the investigation was complete, although it would be
  advisable for them to apply for a Public Non-Exclusive Telecommunications
  Service (PNETS) license.

- OFTA has been quoted in the press as admitting to "grey areas" in the
  telecommunications ordinance, particularly in regards to PNETS.

- The raids stem from a complaint from "an international telecommunications
  supplier" according to a police source. This would therefore point to
  either Hong Kong Telecom or the only surviving Internet supplier, Supernet.
The later of which has publicly stated that it would use OFTA to battle price
cutting moves by its unlicensed competitors.

- Why was the CCB involved in a simple HK$700 licensing issue on the same
  level as illegal hawking? Who is really behind this operation?

- What does this signal for the future of freedom of information and freedom
of speech in Hong Kong?

- What does this do to Hong Kong's International business reputation
  regarding competition and free trade?

- What effect will this have on the literally hundreds of local Bulletin
Board Systems (BBS) who also provide various forms of telecommunication
services? Such services include Email, which was specifically pointed out by
C.L. Ng of OFTA as illegal without a license on Friday afternoon at the site
of one of the affected providers. Why were these and many commercial firms
operating similar services not raided?

Monday's event will be hosted by one of the affected providers, Asia On-Line
Ltd. Guest representing a cross section of the public and private sector will
be invited to take part as will individuals now facing criminal charges over
this issue.

Confirmation of venue and time can be obtained by calling (852) 2866-6018 on
Monday morning.

Subject: The Current Text Scene

Dear _blank_,

I am sending this seemingly non-form letter to you and _blank_ publication on
behalf of myself and The Current Text Scene <http://scene.textfiles.com>.
The purpose of this email is approximately twenty-fold, but I will just mention
the key points for clarity.

1) I'm the new webmaster for The Current Text Scene, so hello, _blank_.  I'm
looking forward to learning more about all of the zines involved in the Text
Scene, so hopefully we will get a chance to chat it up sometime soon.

2) [omitted due to excessive profanity]

3) when you have releases that you want listed on the site you should send them
to bmc@textfiles.com instead of the address that you were previously sending
them to.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Peace!
BMC

I like the way i smell, pretty much. My fragrance? The Perfume of the Doomed, 
that sweet bouquet of decay that reminds me, now and then, that someday i'll 
be intimate with worms. I smell like a box full of gamey flesh, but that's 
okay. Hugs, anyone?

I just checked out the Greeny site.  It looks really great.

DTO died in the beginning of this summer, due to personality conflicts, and
arguments about the direction of the 'zine, and also the fact that many of us
just stopped caring.  Regardless, three new e'zines have sprung up out of dto.
info on these can be found at www.dto.net, however, I'm helping Trilobyte run a
new one "Neti, Neti" (www.netineti.net) which is primarily a humor e'zine.  Go
us.  Anyway, it's good to see GWD still alive and well.  I'm gonna add the gwd
site to my e'zine links page, of my homepage (www.netineti.net/okay/)...

Cheers, you bastard!

"Hot Girls in Panties" by Seth The Man

06.17.2000 02:39:14 PM: I've just seen the best marketing technique ever. Hot
Girls in Panties. It's an incredible draw, Fuschnaps and I were powerless to
resist it and were forced to go look at CDWarehouse's over-priced DVDs. They
just stood on the sidewalk and bounced around. There were also some gay guys to
attract the ladies (women love gay guys) .. Very effective. 'schnaps and I
discussed whether they might be a traveling marketing team. Wandering from city
to city, Hot Girls in Panties (with gay guys), bringing pizza and customers to
any establishment that needs them. Traffic Jams and Ogling for all!

this seems like the best place to post this, so here goes......

Lubbock's very own cDc Publications was featured today on Geraldo (actually,
Geraldo is still on). He's talking about "Computer Vice". They had some greasy 
goober on there that said he caught the occult group behind all sorts of shit, 
which was then revealed to be described in a cDc file (probably available 
here). They then went on to talk about another couple of cDc files, and lots 
of other crap. If they give a number we can call to heckle them, I'll be sure 
and call back to post it. Basically, they're saying that everyone who uses a 
modem is a child pornographer who kills people and sells snuff films on the 
side (first crack stone free with every purchase). It is to laugh.

I hereby declare a flame war against Breed X.

For those not "in the know," the way the "war" is conducted is fairly 
straightforward: one person, typically an arrogant, idiotic newbie, hurls inane
and witless insults at another person, typically an experienced and esteemed
member of the online community, in a usually futile attempt to gain status in
that community.  I was one of the few exceptions: in my wars, I was able to
successfully dispatch impotent dinosaurs like "Snowcrash" and "Ratt Fink" to
assume a hegemony over the rest of the BBS community in Lubbock, Texas.

In an effort to respect the tradition, I will assume the status of newbie by 
reprising my Newbiean, ultra-violent persona of Buttworm.  Also, I will overuse
capitals and expletives, standard literary devices of Newbiean literature:

"BREED X, YOU ARE A MOTHERFUCKING BITCH.  WHAT KIND OF STUPID FUCKING NAME IS
THAT SHIT?  WHAT THE FUCK DOES IT EVEN MEAN?  DOES IT MEAN YOU FUCK YOUR MOM?
IT PROBABLY DOES, YOU SICK FUCK.  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GOING TO DO?  YOU WANNA
KICK MY ASS, YOU SISSY FUCK?  YOU WANNA STICK YOUR ENGORGED COCK INTO MY TINY,
PUCKERED ASSHOLE?  YOU PROBABLY DO, YOU SICK FUCK."

"I'LL FUCK YOU WITH MY MOTHERFUCKING EARS, YOU GAY BITCH."
                                             -----Buttworm

God, I miss Chaos.

True to internet flame wars, I'll don the persona of "Aged Elite UberGeek" and
give a traditional response:

"Re: Motherf*cker X
Buttworm:

Your IQ is showing.  For example, what evidence do you have that I am 'A
MOTHERFUCING BITCH'?  None.  Were you actually looking for some kind of
intelligent response, or were you simply typing because you were born with
fingers?  Please allow me give you some friendly advice.  First, please use the
'Caps Lock' key to turn off uppercase letters.  It is usually located below Tab
and above left Shift.  Typing in all caps simply annoys people and again shows
your ignorance.  Next, you should really read the list and get to know me before
simply lashing out and attacking me.  It is readily apparent that you are new to
this list.  If you would have spent some time to read some of my previous
messages, you would have learned that I am not homosexual:  I have a wife and
17 kids to prove it.  In fact, your twisted little email is littered with
references to the buttocks (including your handle) and gay sexual acts...perhaps
you should take a good hard look at your own life before blindly accusing
somebody you don't even know.  I cannot even believe that I have wasted part of
my ultra-important day to respond to your childish comments.

Subject: CYBER KNIGHT

Hello Lobo,

PRESS RELEASE :            THE CYBER KNIGHT AWARD


We are asking your help in getting word out to the cyberspace community about a
new award that recognizes volunteerism and helpfulness on the net, the CYBER
KNIGHT AWARD!

The Cyber Knight Award is intended to recognize the altruistic efforts of the
unsung heroes and heroines of the Internet who are quietly giving of themselves
to make cyberspace a better place for all of us.  Just as the Knights of old
were dedicated to helping the helpless and righting wrongs in their corner of
the world, so these selfless individuals are finding ways to make a difference
online.

The Cyber Knight Newsletter is dedicated to providing a place to say "Thank
You!" to all these folks and special recognition, the Cyber Knight Award, to a
few that have gone way beyond the call of duty.

We are encouraging anyone in the internet community to submit the name of
someone they think fits our profile and a short description of his or her
contribution for consideration as a Cyber Knight.  Please remember, this award
is NOT recognizing accomplishment in their field, such as a cool new program or
website. There are already awards for those things.  We are looking for
individuals who are giving of themselves to help others without any intent of
personal gain.

The Cyber Knight Newsletter editorial staff will select up to 25 entrees and
will recognize these in the next newsletter.  Newsletter subscribers will then
vote on the entree they feel best exemplifies the ideals of a Cyber Knight.  The
entree with the most votes will be Knighted Sir or Lady Winner, receive the
Cyber Knight Award, be featured in the next newsletter, and be permanently
posted to the "Cyber Knights of the Roundtable" page.
 
The news letter is FREE and subscribers are eligible to submit candidates for
the award and vote on the Cyber Knight of their choice, by e-mailing us at
mailto:subscribe@mosesplaques.com or by visiting our site at
http://www.mosesplaques.com.  This is just another way everyone can do his or
her part to make cyberspace the very best it can be.  Help us recognize those
who are making a difference so others will be encouraged to pitch in.

We are asking your help in getting the word out to the cyberspace community by
running the following announcement in your news letter or ezine as a service to
your subscribers.     Thank you!

ANNOUNCING:   The Cyber Knight Award
New award recognizing volunteerism & helpfulness in cyberspace.
You submit candidates and you select the winner.  All FREE!
Join the effort to make cyberspace a better place to be.
Help make a difference!  Details at  http://www.mosesplaques.com  
or subscribe free at: mailto:subscribe@mosesplaques.com


Again, we want to thank you for your help in getting this information out to
your part of the Internet.  Because the net is sooo complex, our fear is that
there are wonderful people out there doing wonderful things for others who will
never get recognized because we at the Cyber Knight Newsletter never learn about
them.

"Dogmatics" by Seth The Man

I was thinking today about a conversation that I'd had with Oscar about some
dogmatic people that we know. It got me to thinking about why society seems to
value that kind of attitude. We have a respect for people who are, for lack of
a better phrase, close minded and stubborn. I find it hard to see why someone
who can not adapt their views to new data should be admirable. It's part of the
reason I changed how I classify myself from atheist to agnostic. An Atheiest,
it would seem, is just as dogmatic and closed to new information as a heavily
religous person would be. The problem with a deity (due to the nature of the
idea) is that it is not possible to prove, or even support, a view for it's
existence or non-existence, so taking either side of the road is to take some
faith. I don't like the concept of faith. I think it closes too many doors.
Similarly I don't see why one would want to vote for a politician with strong
personal views on issues. Representatives are supposed to represent us to our
government, but when a politician is seen as changing his position for the
public, he's seen as pandering and wishy-washy. Why? Isn't he supposed to
support what the populace  would want him to? .. Just some thoughts that were
bouncing around in my head.

 I look at the whole girl. I look at her face, then sweep downwards, then ask
her to turn around. Then I repeat the procedure. Then I ask her to take her 
clothes off so I really CAN look at the whole girl, but usually I just end up 
with a hand print on my face.

Subject: Joint Venture Proposal

Cape Town, January 24th, 1999

Dear Editor,

Do you want 50% of my offshore profits?

Let me introduce myself. My name is John Roberston and I'm the owner of the
Offshore Profit Center Website at http://onlineprofit.com. Thousands of
clients have taken advantage of our offshore business packages, offshore
bank accounts, offshore corporations, second passports, diplomatic
appointments, offshore banks, consultations, and much more. Most of these
products and services have a very high profit margin, and I'm willing to
give you 50% of my profits if you follow the simple steps below.

Here's how it works:

You simply send a message to your subscribers saying that you were able to
"arrange an exclusive and time limited discount of 15%" for them at "one of
the Internet's largest and most well known offshore services providers".
You would tell them about some of the "benefits of going offshore" (tax
reduction, asset protection, financial privacy etc) and our Website
address. You would also tell them that if they mention YOUR NAME (or a
special order code if you prefer) when placing their order, they would
"receive a 15% discount" on "any and all products and services" - without
exception.

THAT'S IT - I'll take care of the rest!

Your subscribers go to my site, look around, place an order, get the
discount, and YOU get paid 50% of my net profits! That's right! Let me
repeat this: I'm willing to share my profits equally with you to thank you
for your efforts!!

So how much $$$ can you make? Let's take a look at the following example.
Our most popular offshore package, the Global CyberBusiness Package,
consists of an offshore corporation, a bank account, a tape course and a
consultation package. It costs $1,999 retail, after the 15% discount the
price would be $1699.15.

Now, if someone orders this package at the reduced price, my total profit
is $581.49. Let's assume that this particular client is referred by you -
in this the case I would send you $290.75. But it doesn't stop here. Let's
assume that once you've run the endorsement in your newsletter, and not
one... but TWENTY of your subscribers decide to order the package. That's
an amazing $5,815.00 for you - for ten minutes of extra work!!

That's easy and quick money for you, wouldn't you agree?

But it still gets better. We also offer offshore banks, second
citizenships, identity cards, driver's licenses, confidential
consultations, and more. My net profit on the citizenships and banks can be
well in the four or even five digit range! Just a couple of these high
ticket orders could make you more money than a single issue of your
newsletter ever will.

Anyway, once you've reviewed my site at http://onlineprofit.com I hope
you'll realize that this is much more than a great money making opportunity
- it is a mission to free the world from the shackles of big government! If
you agree with the values of freedom, capitalism and individualism, I
invite you to get back to me right away. If we go into business and make
money together let's do it as soon as possible, as there isn't much time
left before Y2K.
I'm so excited I'll be staying up all night to hear from you!

Kind regards,

John Roberston

D> Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You BASTARDS!!!!

You'd be surprised how often I get that.  Just being associated with that show
in ANY way has transformed me into an expert on South Park (which I'm not -- 
I've only seen the genetic engineering episode and the "Spirit of Christmas" 
video clip...) and turned me into a local celebrity.  Women line my door 
screaming, "Show us Kenny, you rotten bastards!!"  I'm mobbed everywhere I go.
I'm beginning to fear for my life.  I've become addicted to narcotics.  I 
am a devil worshipper.  People say that I express my thoughts in short, choppy
sentences.  Trash cans somehow look "comfey."  I am allegric to polyester.

Months-old post with a months-old pent-up over-hyphenated reply.  Yeeeah.

Okay, how's about some truly tasteless and altogether offensive chat... No 
holds barred, no fear of damnation, no class cracking on what ever comes to 
mind.  Like today, I was at work, and was tellin' this guy that I like it when
a chick talkis to me when we're fucking... you know, when she say things like 
"HELP! GET THE FUCK OFF ME!"... That shit really turns me on;  this guy looks 
at me like I'm Satan and says, and I'm quoting  "For real?"

Organization: The Revolution
Subject: press release
To: GwD@GREENY.org, et al.

The Revolution Starts on the Internet

A political party called The Revolution has formed on the Net at
http://www.the-revolution.org.  The Revolution has a POST-MODERN SOCIAL CONTRACT
WITH AMERICA <http://www.disinfo.com/prop/diss/prop_diss_revolution1.html> and a
15 POINT PLATFORM <http://the-revolution.org/platform.htm> that includes
repealing five laws for every one they pass, legalizing most drugs, dismantling
the Prison/Industrial complex, redefining work, and pledging a VICTORY OVER
HORSESHIT in government.

The Revolution has already attracted several hundred members, 99% of whom are in
their teens or twenties.  R. U. Sirius, co-founder of Mondo 2000 magazine,
author of "How to Mutate and Take Over the World", and general counter-cultural
icon, is expected to be The Revolution's Presidential Candidate in 2000.  Sirius
promises to light up a Cuban cigar the very second he's in orifice.  This act,
and all other actions worthy of notice, will be broadcast on The Revolution's
website.

Scary thing is, as low as voter turnouts have been lately, the internet could
actually ELECT a candidate.

********

The Revolution 7 Point Platform for the Internet and the Computer Industry

Pre-Ramble
The body politic of the Internet is as unpredictably perverse as Marv Albert
after a fifth of Scotch.  Er... that doesn't sound right.  What we really mean
to say is that in a random poll previous to the 1996 Election, Netizens selected
the Libertarian candidate as their President, and Ralph Nader came in second.
We feel that The Revolution offers up a political choice that combines the best
of the Libertarians and St. Ralph, with a dash of centrist policy techno-wonk
Newt Gore.  We have therefore arrogantly presumed the mantel of Political Party
of the Internet.

Unlike the technolibertarians, we feel that a wee bit of Government intervention
can be groovy!... but only if WE are the Government.  Unlike the Neo-Luddites,
we're rather fond of the microchips that FEMA secretly planted up our butts.
Unlike the Technorealists, we're not as boring as an Amish rock festival.

Aside from having a sense of humor, these are our Internet/High Tech Policy
Points

1)  No Censorship

The Revolution opposes all censorship, but we're particularly strident about our
opposition to censorship on the Net.  The Net makes public "speech" and
"publishing" as spontaneous as using the telephone.  To apply standards of other
media, or even publishing, to this technology is like legislating and policing
neighborhood gossip.
        Obviously, some things fall under necessarily existing laws.  You can't
solicit for murder at the neighborhood bar or on the net.  And you can't show
pornography to children on the street.  On the other hand, if the children sneak
off into the bushes after nipping some of your porn, most sane people won't hold
you responsible.
         We believe in protecting kids.  The question is, how?  By keeping them
in a playpen until they have to hit the streets?  Or by preparing them, arming
them with skills to cope with an adult world?
        We suggest full disclosure.  Freedom of information for kids.  New media
is ubiquitous. And it's ephemeral, like the air--integrating into the social
sphere as a seamless environment where we spend a goodly portion of our lives.
We are ultimately faced with the choice of censoring all our media till it's
safe for children, or teaching our children to cope with the media.  We're not
suggesting forcing horrible and perverse materials on kids, but we do suggest
that we let the kids access all the information they're going to need for
surviving in a crazy world, one in which all of the stuff of the human psyche,
both brilliant and grotesque, is on full display.  Protecting children from
content might actually be viewed as a DISservice--the opposite of education.

2:  Universal Access.
The net is the site of our worldwide global conversation and a potential site
for participatory democracy.  Those without access are disenfranchised.
Therefore we suggest a 3 year program for universal access, accomplished by the
free distribution of inexpensive, Internet-ready boxes, as well as a continued
and redoubled effort to get net access into all Libraries, Schools, and many
other public areas across America.

3:  Privacy
We are for full free access to encryption technology, and will encourage its use
as something that will help resolve problems of identity theft and other online
rip-offs.  We support all social and technological solutions that acknowledge
the individuals ownership of his or her own information.  A great example of
this is the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P): The goal of P3P is to enable
Web sites to express their privacy practices and enable users to exercise
preferences over those practices.  P3P products will allow users to be informed
of site practices (in both machine and human readable formats), to delegate
decisions to their computer when appropriate, and allow users to tailor their
relationship to specific sites. (from the P3P FAQ at
http://www.w3.org/P3P/P3FAQ.htm).

We would make the collection and sale of individual private data for commercial
purposes without permission completely illegal.   We would enforce this
vigorously.

4:  Copyright
Digital and other technologies have made it difficult to enforce copyright
protection for media and software creations.  The entertainment industry, which
largely controls the Democratic Party, has responded by redoubling its effort to
create ever more draconian copyright restrictions.  You now can't legally walk
into a copy shop and Xerox a chapter out of a book.  Recent attempts to pass
legislation that would have made it technically illegal to download materials
off the Web and print them without explicit permission did not succeed.
However, excessive copyright, trademark, and libel restrictions already feed an
army of hungry lawyers and restrict freedom of speech (in the broad sense that
includes all media) and research.

The Revolution supports the continued existence of copyright.  Creators should
have the right to own and benefit from the products of their minds.  It is also
economically necessary, under current conditions, that they continue to do so.
We believe, however, that  copyright protection must be rewritten to be more
flexible in light of current realities.  The concept of fair use must be
supported and expanded in an increasingly mediated environment.

5:  Consumer Advocacy
The federal government should set up an special consumer affairs division aimed
solely at the computer/net industry.  The atrocious behavior of this industry
towards consumers must be stopped.  Because computers and computer networks are
a new frontier for commerce, vendors and service providers have managed to get
away with selling faulty product, oversubscribing networks till they no longer
serve the consumer's needs, engaging in standards wars that are disruptive to
service and stability, etc.  If government agencies are good for anything, it's
for ensuring that consumers aren't victims of malevolent business practices.

Relatedly, we believe the federal government should punish Microsoft severely
enough so that it hurts for its sleazy monopolistic practices.  But separating
Explorer from Windows just doesn't make any danm sense.  Packing them together
really IS the natural thing to do.

"Triads" by Seth The Man

I think I've found another triad that fits the old 'Pick any two..' adage. You
can be: [Honest, Good, Friendly] at any given time. But only two of the set at
once. I think a lot of my personal integrity faults have resulted from me trying
to be all three at once. I think a lot of my disappointments in others was in
expecting them to be all three at once. If anyone knows of any other 'Pick any
two' sets, send 'em to me. I think I might make a GwD file from 'em if I can
get enough..

Subject: GETTING TO KNOW THE DRUGS YOU TAKE

* Here's to the wine-drinking Danes!

Yet another study has confirmed a regular tipple of wine may
reduce your chance of suffering a stroke. Researchers at
Copenhagen University studied 13,000 Danes over 16 years and
found that daily wine drinkers were 32% less prone to strokes.
What's more, drinking wine with your meal may also prevent
unhealthy changes in your blood composition caused by your
food. The researchers found no similar benefits for beer or
liquor consumption. To get to the bottom of Danish drinking
habits, see http://www.mediconsult.com/strokes/news/

And while studies may point to the benefits of daily wine drinking,
consumption of alcohol of any kind always involves risks.
For a greater understanding of alcohol's pros and cons, see

                          ----------------------

        what is dummercon?  well, basically, it's another one of those 
 get-together deals.  but, not just _any_ get-together deal.  no way, chico!
 a get-together deal for _'zine guys_!  woo woo.
 
        no little majormud geeks with supersoakers here, baby. no sir-ee.

        no dewdle boys looking for an ass to kiss, either.  nope nope.
        
        just 100% pure mackin' 'zine guys!
        
        it'll be educational.  entertaining.  all that good stuff and then
 some!

        ALL ARE INVITED.  ONLY THE MOST ELITE WILL SHOW UP.

 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================

                          where and when is it?
                          ---------------------

                         monday, july 31st, 1995
                           12:00 noon - 8:00 pm
                        
                                fdr park
                              picnic area 7
                            philadelphia, pa.

 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================
                          
                          what will be happening?
            (or; why the hell should i haul my ass to philly?)                          
            --------------------------------------------------

        dummercon '96 will _basically_ be a two-day dealy-deal formulated and
 concieved of for the sole purpose of disgusting all of the modem warriors in
 the e'zine scene by introducing us to each other, or at least whoever shows
 up.
        
        day one - (optional jammy) lollapalooza!  that's right.  some wise
 dummercon folks decided it would be pretty keen to catch lollapalooza in
 philly on july 30th, which is the day before dummercon!  wowza.  if you want
 to go, there will be a nice sized caravan heading on up to the camden 
 waterfront park, so transportation will be no problem.  you just need to
 snatch yourself some tickets.  black francis and courtney love within a 
 miles radius of each other?  would you even dare miss it?

        day two - the dummercon festivities (which we will go into detail 
 with shortly)!

        although we will actually be having conversations on e'zines, ideas, 
 and progressing things we might be doing, the meeting is also amazingly 
 intended to be a social event.  we're assuming this isn't a big deal and no 
 one coming to this deal will be some ansi dewdleboy that spends most of his 
 suburban life trapped up in his room because mommie and daddy don't 'get' 
 why he spends every waking hour drawing a picture of calvin and hobbes with 
 colored blocks on his computer.  NO NONE OF THOSE GUYS HERE, NO SIR.

        there are actually activities planned and raddy-rad things in the 
 works.  if you have any suggestions, you can contact us at the places 
 specified later in this file.  amazingly enough, here are some of the events
 that are being planned;

 [-----]        
        
        food, food, food!  yeah, that's right, dummercon '96 is basically a
 large scale computer-geek picnic.  plenty of grub for _everyone_, even our
 'husky' friends.

        bobbing for warez!  who can courier the warez out from the small tub
 of water the fastest?  only the elite shall survive!  lamers will be 
 drowned!
        
        fun!  games!  prizes!  the big bag of dumb stuff raffle (come and
 find out just what in blazes we're talking about)!
        
        hang out with some of the coolest cats, like mogel, black francis,
 and other e'zine guys!  pretend you're elite enough to be our friends!
 
        now, how much would you pay for this package?  now wait; there's 
 more!

        it's all all-out jam fest with black francis' super phat band, glue!
 that's right!  glue - live - at dummercon '96!
        
 ============================================================================
 ============================================================================                                   

                 is there any cost?  what can i do to help?
                 ------------------------------------------

        dummercon is a going to be based on a very inexpensive site for one 
 very simple reason; we're all poor dumb moronic youthful angst-ridden 
 rejects.  we have no money.  this means bring your own picnic-like food.  
 don't come to dummercon without food expecting uncle moggie to take pity on
 you.  I'LL EAT MY FRIGGIN' PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH RIGHT IN YOUR 
 STINKIN' FACE, YOU MOOCHER.  YEAH!@  point; bring food.  lots of it.  
 especially if you're fat, ugly, stupid, slob.

        that means _yew_, baby!

        you're also welcome to bring fun-fun stuff.  bring your favorite 
 tapes and cds (label your stuff so no one will haxor your stuff!@).  bring 
 free printed out examples of your 'zine to pass around.  bring free stuff to 
 give out.  bring us food.  bring us virgin women to sacrafice.  wear really 
 stupid outfits.  bring your pet Frog.  Bring turnip seeds to plant.  bring 
 your 0-day gnu phresh warez to trade!@  bring cooley-cool high-tech computer
 stuff!@  bring your girlezz that we can wership!@

        it wouldn't hurt to tell someone that you were coming either.

        oh, and _no one_ better give a peep to syrinx about this.

        (check the bottom of this here file to find out just how you can do 
 that, slick.  oh, wait, here it is now!@  wow!@)

Subject: NEWS RELEASE! NON-SURGICAL LIPOSUCTION NOWW AVAILABLE IN U.S.A.!!!

Sparks International, an import company based in South Carolina, announces a
breakthrough herbal product that creates immediate, permanent fat-loss for a
fraction of the cost of liposuction surgery and is now available in the United
States for the first time.

"Now Americans don't have to resort to the pain and expense of liposuction
surgery to get immediate results on stubborn fat and cellulite." explained
Sparks president James Yates. 

"Our revolutionary herbal gel is gently rubbed into the skin. The liposome
formula quickly penetrates to the fatty tissue where it liqefies the excess fat
on contact. The body then treats the liquefied fat as a waste product and
eliminates it naturally through urination. 

"Another great advantage," Yates continued, "is that our product retails for
under $200 and produces real fat loss -- not water loss -- in 24 hours.

"Although our product is new in the United States, it has been sold
internationally for four years. The statistics on over one million international
customers show an average permanent fat loss of 1 to 1-1/2 inches in each fat-
prone area -- stomach, hips, and thighs -- with just one application."

Yates further explained that the herbal gel is safe to use on a regular basis as
many times as needed to achieve individual fat-loss goals. 

"We're very excited about our product because now people on limited budgets can
enjoy the immediate, dramatic results that once only the rich could afford --
without surgery -- and without spending a fortune."

Okay, here's a little Flingy trivia for ya;
My ex-girlfriend, her name's Melonie, went to Puerto Rico this summer.  We 
weren't getting along too well, and the night before she left, we decided to 
"see other people" for the summer.  I had a great summer, and I was actually 
looking forward to her return.  Anyhow, to make a long story short, she got 
back and heard that I was a little fuck machine all summer (which, sad to say,
is untrue), and she pretty much totally slandered me to all of her friends 
(some of whom I liked alot).  Anyway, she ALSO had a new roommate, who's name 
is Amy.  Amy and I soon became BEST FRIENDS (platonic; she's the one with the 
Bull ring).  So, Mel started fucking this guy like 4 days after she "dumped" 
me, which is only annoying because she told all her friends that I had robed 
her of some emotional investment, and I think any emotional investment at all 
would take a little more than 4 days to get over.  So, this is all old news, 
but important backgroung for the story, which is this;
Mel thinks I am some kinda sexual predator; so whenever I go to visit Amy, I 
say things to Amy that I know Mel will overhear, things like "I'm all dressed 
up because I'm goin' to the club to pick up some unsuspecting girl so I can 
use her for sex!"  Amy thinks mel is a Troll (my new nickname for Mel), so she
plays along.. The point?  i'm not sure there is one, except that becoming best
friends with your ex-girlfriend's roommate is a GREAT way to make her realize 
that she lost out in a BIG way when she wasn't capable of any kind of intimacy
beyond spreading her legs; My friendship with Amy is like a constant reminder 
to Mel that she isn't capable of much else, which in the end, is very 
entertaining for me.  Well, 3:15 a.m. Ramble Mode off...

I know this is on the wrong sub, but i don't care.

GwD hereby claims responsibility for the power failure of last week (04/16/96).
Four (count them 1-2-3-4) states lost power because of our meddling.  Heh.
yeah.  Well, we have confirmed reports about parts of Texas and New Mexico
losing power, and unconfirmed reports of parts of Oklahoma.  I guess that
makes 3, eh?  FUCK YOU THEN.  We still did it.  However, we only did it to
avoid global conflagration.  You see, TOFTAOBL was planning to cause a major
fire that would destroy much of western civilization.  Anyway, the plans were
on their Super-Duper Computer (tm), and they appeared to be naught but
garbled code when we stole them, so we had to take the entire system down
just to make sure their data was erased.  it caused a backlash through the
power lines, blacking out parts of the aforementioned states.  GwD was
responsible for the blackout.  This is not an apology.

AT> Take a look and laugh at all the differnet types of twits.

9 out of 10 BBSers think the tenth is an idiot. They're right.
2 out of the ten think the other eight are idiots. They're right too.
The tenth one thinks all the rest are idiots, and says so, as well as commenting
colorfully on their ancestry, habits, and probable destiny in the afterlife.
Six out of the ten laugh heartily at these comments from the tenth. They may 
make death threats as well. Three ignore him.

And yay, when DB looked down from the heavens and saw what Lemmy and Wildcat had
wrought, yea, he became very wroth with them, for had he not decreed on the very
day that Jemaboah came down from the mountain that, yea, those whom had shown
great lameness in his eyes would be shown great iniquity by their lord.

And when wild cat and lemme saw what they had wrought, and yea, they saw even 
unto all of the users of the board how wroth was their god, yea, did they fall
down upon their faces and prostrate themselves before him, and yea, did they
rent their hair, and tear at their clothing, and smite themselves furiously for
the shame that they in their iniquity had caused DB to visit upon them.

For 40 days and 40 nights were they tormented and anguished, and on the morning
of the 41st day did DB come to them in a dream, and yea, he instructed them as
to their crimes and iniquities that they had visited unto themselves, and yea,
unto the innocent users of the board unto the seventh generation, and cast out
upon their bottoms were they, banished from the garden.

And so it is written.

All right sluts we have talked about my last drinking experience way too much so 
it is time for me to change the subject ;-) 
 
If you know me pretty well, then you know I roam around on the delphi message

Well off a crazy Idea, I decided to throw up my own forum... so it is now up 
under the name of

So anyway you chaches, this is a place where we can post events, have lengthy 
discussions, create polls, and do all that jazz... bob can even post porn there.
 
heres da link

It will probably ask for a user name, you can either make an account, or make a 
guest account, its up to you ;-). However, you cannot post messages as a guest.
 
Anyway,  head over there and post and stuff... it also has links to greeny,

Subject: Brand new text files NEWS site! 

    I apologize ahead of time if this e-mail is annoying.  This is not a *spam*,
however.  I specifically chose to write you about a new text files site.  I'm
most likely writing you because you've been involved in the production of some
text publication over the years, or perhaps you're from BBS community from which
these files were commonplace.
    Either way, I've put up a site which I think will be of interest to you.
It's a site that focuses on the "text file scene" as it currently exists.
Perhaps for some of you this site might just be nostalgia, but for others it's a
concentrated effort to make a central site for news, links, and updates for
ASCII 'zines and text.  It will be updated constantly.
	The URL is here:

	http://scene.textfiles.com

	It's worth taking a look at.
    I'm especially hoping that you can throw me some webpage links and/or
references to 'zines that I don't know about, that currently publish.  If you
can help, please write me back.  Thanks for reading this.

"Federation Slayers" by Big Red Fed (BaRF), editorial comments by Lobo Licious
                     and Seth The Man

In the late hours of the night in the year of 1988 I began my first foray into
the online world. It was a time when the fastest modem available was 2400bps or
the equivalent of approximately a 2.4k baud modem [actually, 2400=2.4k baud, so
it's not approximate, chach].  Nothing compared to the speed of a 56k baud modem
of today. A time when ascii and ansi ruled. It was a time of discovery, not just
for me, but for the computer world as well. There was an internet back then, but
not much of, if any World Wide Web. Email, ftp, gopher,and telenet were the most
used terms back then. It was the beggining or the end of the beggining, of the
online era. It was in the wee hours of this period of time that I logged on to
my first Bulletin Board System called The Crystal Palace. The Crystal Palace was
the last of the systems from the end of the beggining. Totally text based and a
top speed of 300baud it was a home of the intellectual. Such discussions,
common today, were more remeniscent of elite social clubsor the writings of
Plato. Everything was discussed and considered. Everyone was accepted after
their own fashion. It was a close knit community, brought closer by the monthly
meetings held at the old town Hi-Di-Ho in Lubbock, Tx. It was at this time that
my brother procured for us that lightning fast 2400baud modem and state of the
art 386 motherboard. Upgrading our old 8088 we were now techno gurus. I began to
log on. The first thing, after who to call that is, you had to choose was a
handle. Only losers would use their real name. So, being red headed and short, I
chose the only appropriate pseudonym, Big Red. The Crystal Palace, Kaptain's
Korner, and Saturday Night Live will always be the hallowed names of great
places where great people gathered. I had to have my own. I went scouting for
the perfect software to run and therewere a few to pick from. I tried WildCat,
PCBoard, Visual BBS [sic; it's "Virtual(net) BBS"], many others and finally
settled on World War IV (WWIV). This was the software that ran the great KK and
SNL and the incentive of registering for ameager $80 (or thourgh the installment
plan) and getting a copy of the sourcecode sold me into this software. Written
by Wayne Bell, he and his software will go down in my personal history as two of
the greatest things in the world. Unziping everything and ignoring the
instructions I began the setup. [Didn't your brother, Fox, actually run the BBS
until he joined the Army?] (Instructions should only be used to further your
education of a product when the need arises to learn specific details not
obvious in the purpose or programming of a product.) I began to select and set
options at will.  Leaving those things I did not understand until I did deem it
necessary I came upon the option that required me to name this new BBS. I think
even back then I had a Libertarian bent, even though I did not know of the party
until almost 8 years later. Although I didn't quite understand myself in any
political sense back then, I wanted a name that reflected my unrealized but
perceived love-hate relationship with government. The names Federation Slayers'
and Big Red Fed presented themselves for inspection to my critical processes
[Actually, if we remember right (which we do), you changed your name to "Big Red
Fed" because Seth's BBS (C.H.A.O.S.) deleted your "Big Red" account for some odd
reason one day, and for some other odd reason would not let you create a new
account with that name. Also, we distinctly remember that the BBS was named
"Federation Slayers" due to your Trade Wars addiction.  You later came up with
this story about the government, but you seem to forget that the "feds" are
employees of the "federal" government, not the "federation."  This ain't Star
Trek.]  At the age of nine [you may have been on-line at nine, but you didn't
run the BBS until 13 or 14, cuz you're are age] these seemed the appropriate
names to me. A new world was born and this one will never be the same because of
it.  [Much as we ridicule you, you're one of us, the last generation to mature
in the Lubbock BBS scene.  You're also a dr00g, and thus you ROCK SERIOUS
BALLS.]

Subject: BATMAN:  Liberal Or Conservative?
Organization: Crossroads Entertainment

:I know this is probably going to get me "BZZZT!!!!1!"ed but...
:Is Batman a liberal or a conservative?  :)

Now THIS is a great question!  Truly worthy of Alt.Politics.Jaffo!

At first glance, Batman might look like a Conservative.  He is certainly "tough
on crime."

However, determining Batman's true ideology is very difficult.

We must first define WHICH Batman we're talking about.

The old 1960's comic strip Batman was nothing more than a glorified policeman.
Go get the criminals, throw them in Arkham, wait for them to escape next week,
go get them again.

In this respect, he wasn't very political.  Perhaps Conservative on the surface,
simply because he was fighting crime within the parameters of the "system."

But in a few instances, we've been treated to a meaner, grittier Batman.  He
wasn't so much interested in "catching" criminals, as he was tracking them down
and beating the bloody shit out of them.  A decidedly Libertarian approach.

He didn't really expect help from the authorities, and he was frequently at odds
with traditional law enforcement.

Of course, there is a third Batman we must consider.  There is the live action
TV Batman, played elegantly by Adam West.  Of all Batman's incarnations, this
is the only one I could possibly characterize as Liberal.

In this program, Batman engaged in a number of border line "Liberal" activities.
I will list them below.

1.  Dancing - While all law enforcement figures do what they can to avoid
charges of "Police Brutality," I believe this incarnation of Batman went far
beyond reasonable measures in this regard.  Not only did Batman frequently avoid
combat with certain criminals, but he actually spent a good portion of his
career DANCING, FLIRTING, negotiating, and even SLEEPING WITH many criminals.
I'm sure many of you Liberal ninnies think this kind of activity is pure
fiction, with no bearing on real life law enforcement.  I have only two words
to share with you:  MIDNIGHT BASKETBALL.

PS:  I would also like to add that no Conservative has ever done "The Batman"
and any Conservative caught doing this "Liberal" dance would immediately be
drummed from the Continuum and be forced to make Star Trek guest appearances
until his hair fell out.

NOTE:  This punishment was never applied to Phil Gramm.  His hair loss is
completely unrelated to this procedure.  Phil's sins are his own, and I assure
you, they involve a completely different Superhero.

You can tell the "Good Conservatives" from the "Bad Conservatives" by the amount
of hair they have left.  Please witness the thick, bushy mops sported by Newt
Gingrich and Jack Kemp and adjust your votes accordingly.

Also note that the Liberals have an entirely different punishment schedule for
their candidates.  I can't disclose what it is, but let's just say the
anatomy involved is commonly hidden from pubic^H^H^H^H^H public view, and if you
knew what it was, you would gain a whole new understanding of Democratic
opposition to Paula Jones.

(And if one of our worst punishments is Hair Loss, you can just imagine what Bob
Dole did that we had to break his arm and rip out his prostate...)

In fact, I believe I am the only Conservative ever to sit through the entire
scene in Pulp Fiction where John Travolta dances "The Batman," and rest assured,
I was searching frantically for my remote control during the entire sequence.

2.  Favoritism - Adam West's Batman maintained a disturbing DOUBLE STANDARD with
regard to criminal punishment.  He callously abused the expendable underlings,
while treating the criminal masterminds like fine china.  I mean, let's face it,
can you name one Batman villain that could withstand a good punch in the jaw?

The Joker was a string bean wimp (and a notorious Homosexual!).  The Penguin had
a serious weight problem and poor vision.  King Tut was at least ambulatory, but
he couldn't stand up to a gang of unruly fourth graders, much less a divine
specimen of manhood like BM.

The Riddler looked wiry, but in those tights, a number of *ahem* obvious targets
would make him vulnerable in combat.

And don't even get me STARTED on the women!

In short, Batman displayed a very Liberal attitude toward crime, punishing the
economically disadvantaged underlings while allowing the true hard core felons
to escape.

In this regard, Adam West's Batman is less like a Crimefighter and more like a
strangely-dressed Tort Lawyer.

3.  Batman was a single parent.  While I applaud Batman's sense of personal
responsibility in taking care of young Dick Grayson, the boy needed a strong
female role model to develop properly.  By granting the boy a life of wealth and
adventure, without providing a stable home environment, Bruce Wayne left the boy
open to manipulation by disreputable females.  I grant you, Catwoman would be
enough to disrupt even a stable nuclear family, but without a strong "Mother"
figure to advise him, Robin was shockingly naive in his dealings with women.

Conservative men recognize the inherent treachery of women, and we avoid contact
with them except in the most structured and supervised environments.

Without a strong Mother figure, Robin's sexuality was permanently stuck in a
childlike state.  Batman would warn him repeatedly to stay clear of these
predatory women, only to fall into their clutches himself later in the episode!

Given this unhealthy contrast, it's a wonder Robin didn't "fall from the apple
cart" more often!

Finally, I must take issue with Robin's mode of dress.  I have already
demonstrated a number of credible threats to Robin's masculinity.  I'm sure the
tights and the truly indecent short shorts could have pushed him over the edge!

To constantly expose this young man to a number of "alternative lifestyles", and
not even allow him the dignity of TROUSERS!!!  I think you can see why I can not
endorse Batman's parenting.

In fact, based on these elements, one can only speculate on Batman's true
motives with regard to Robin.  Was Batman simply compensating for his own
hyper-masculinity?  Or was something darker at work?

I do not wish to speculate.

4.  Finally, the most telling aspect of Batman's Liberalism, we have obtained
proof that in 1992, Adam West voted for Bill Clinton.

Let that be the final nail in the caped crusader's coffin...

I remain,

Jaffo

                                                November 8, 1995

        Dear Mr. Prosecutor,

             My son, Shane Beesinger (05/06/77), and his friends 
        were out on October 31st, 1995 in the vicinity of the 
        2400 block of East Canyon Lake. He was stopped by the
        police and each person was given a ticket for park
        curfew. His citation number was 95141032. They had been
        looking for a haunted house in that area. They were not
        aware of a park curfew, nor were they doing anything wrong.
        They were leaving the park area as they were stopped.
        They saw no sign posted, nor did the policeman give them
        a warning that they should not have been there. I called
        internal affairs, and was told that "white kids at Mae
        Simmons was like seeing a '57 Chevy at LakeRidge," and
        that they did not belong there. I asked if that meant only
        Cadillacs were at LakeRidge and '57 Chevy's on the East Side,
        and he replied "yes." I said, "If there are black teenagers
        at Maxey or Godeke Park, that they shouldn't be there." He
        said that I took that out of context. I don't think so. I
        guess that means that my son shouldn't have been a lifeguard
        at Mae Simmons Park all summer for the city. He said that they
        were never to go to that park. I asked why the ones fishing 
        were not ticketed, and was told that "they do not hurt anything".
        Is that what the ordinance says, "...except those fishing"?
        
                The kids were leaving, and had done nothing wrong.
        There were no drugs, and was no drinking. They were all of
        age 17 to 18 years old, and they do not belong to any gang.

                I plead to the court to dismiss this ticket this time.
        Shane has never been in trouble with the law, and is soon to
        start attending Tech in the spring, and $75 would help buy books.
        I doubt if he goes to the park again. Thank you for your time.

                                              Thank You,

                                              Karen Beesinger

The reason(s) girls rack guys:

1. They don't realize how much it hurts.
2. They're bitter, mean, and vicious because the male has the physical 
   advantage, and they can't psychologically handle that, because they're
   so used to being in control they can't handle it when they're suddenly 
   plucked from that position of authority.
3. It's a form of penis envy. They're pissed because they don't have those
   neat toys, and they go by the maxim, if I can't have them, then you sure
   won't!

Really girlies, racking a guy is a chicken-hearted, lily-livered, cowardly 
thing to do that shouldn't ever be done unless you're in immediate physical 
danger. Women think they know what this feels like, but they don't. Your 
typical woman goes around bragging/bitching about the pain of birth and the 
like, even though they've probably not even given birth yet. Even if they 
have, they've only done it on the average of twice. Guys get racked a lot more
than two times in their lifetimes, I would venture to say. Just imagine this 
girls. Imagine the pain of giving birth for the first time (we're talking a 36
hour labor here with multiple complications) mulitplied by two and 
concentrated in an area of your body no bigger than a marble. Pain? You 
betcha.

   Liar. The Internet is programmed into your BIOS. It's a highly-sophisticated
AI program developed by the NSA to keep track of you and allow montoring of your

Who has the time or effort to remember all these ridiculous acronyms that
people require you to know when you're applying for membership on an elite
board?  I can understand the fact that we want to keep lamers out but most of
the groups using those acronyms are not that popular in Houston and most people
don't know them anyway yet they expect others to.  Here is a list of over 66
most common acronyms asked on New User Application forms in the Houston 713
area.  It was compiled over a period of 6 months and I believe I have covered
most of the groups.  Enjoy and keep the information flowing!

14/50: eh
Name: Kp Neato Dee #14
Date: Thu Mar 17 07:12:41 1994

FA> 
FA> Met girl - Good.
FA> Found out girl was 14 - bad

wow.  When i was like 18 or 19, i met this girl at a thrash metal show who 
used to call me and it turned out she was >12< at the time.  i figured she was 
17 or something.

FA> haven't touched girl in 5 1/2 months - bad

eh, i ain't had a substantial conversation with a female in about that long.
that's ok.  you've got a car you can start by radio control, like KITT from 
Knight Rider.

Who needs the often-comforting, always-interesting love interests when you've 
got a bitchin' car?  Who needs the simple but immeasurable joy of eyes that 
seem to smile...and don't look away... when you've got a COLOR TV?  Who needs 
that phone call at 1am saying, "I couldn't sleep, I was thinking about you and 
wanted to talk" in a sleepy voice when you've got a KILLER STEREO SYSTEM AND 
LOTS OF HIP MUSIC?  oh oh HEAPS and HEAPS of HIP MUSIC, only the coolest TUNES
that only COOL people have HEARD of, to be SURE.  My SENSES are so BLOATED and
DULLED with nothing but absolutely the COOLEST TUNEZ as authenticated and 
APPROVED by GENERATION X, INC. that if i WERE to VOMIT, i would not NOTICE.
Who needs to know that you've somehow managed to convince somebody else in 
this whole big world to give a damn about you and your kinda ridiculous
hopes&dreams, etc. WHEN YOU'VE GOT A BIG FUCKING ROCK?!  YEAH, A BIG FUCKIN' 
ROCK!  THE BIGGEST!  THE HARDEST!  OOH!  WHAT A ROCK!  it just makes me wanna 
shout up and down, UP and DOWN, what a BIG, HARD, ROCK this is!  WOW!  Oh 
baby, baby, i'm gonna SMASH this BIG FUCKIN' ROCK and DAMN, it'll be 
IMPRESSIVE!  SO YOU JUST WATCH, NOW!  WATCH and LEARN!
So i've got my ROCK and my TV and my STEREO and MAN, what the FUCK could 
ANYONE possibly THINK OF NEXT?!  i just can't WAIT!  OOH!

KPNDuh
technology is wonderful
you'll die too
