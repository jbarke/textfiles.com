[1]  Introduction:  FIVE YEARS OF DOMINATION (What This Is All About)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GREENY world Domination Task Force, Inc. became FIVE years old on 6-10-1998.

This is a special issue that many will find boring and inane if they were not
in attendance at the event(s) described or do not fully comprehend what GwD has
come to be during the first FIVE YEARS OF DOMINATION.

The world took little note of the anniversary; there were no prime time
interviews or talk show appearances.  Only a small band of people calling
themselves "dr00gs" who converged at short notice around a farm house just north
of Lubbock, Texas, over a week after the actual anniversary (which seemed to
have been all but forgotten) seemed to notice the event at all.

Lobo Licious had vainly named the celebration GwaDFest98 back when he had
vaguely hinted at a larger-scale event, which he never got around to planning.
Thanks to Seth The Man, Diamondback, and of course, Marduk (without whom there
would have been no place for the party), GwaDFest98 became a reality.  Those who
were in attendance are the k00lest of the k00l...the TRUE dr00gs.  Here are some
of their reflections on GwaDFest, as well as reflections by some on GwD in
general and/or specific aspects of GwD, such as CHAOS, our birthplace.....

 - Seth The Man -

Oh yeah.  Kickin' it old school.

Well, not really.  Things have changed a lot in 5 years.  But then again, not
all things have really changed that much.

I'm here, in my car, on my laptop, listening to Sekrut Squirrel MP3s, writing a
bit about the party.

Or Part-Ae, rather.

The GwD 5 year anniversary party.

We're five now, and ready to school the world.

But not yet.  Right now it's just time to celebrate.  Drink the alcohol, see old
friends.

Kickin' it ..

Lessee...the night started amazingly familiar.  A small group of Droogs, waitin'
for the rest.  Wondering if this is gonna turn out well...with the vague feeling
it won't...but as we get started...start doing stuff...in this case, trying to
figure out what it is you actually do with a grill, lighter fluid, and 24
patties of ground beef...then things started to feel a little more comfortable.
Things started happening.  Music is played.  The Reverend Horton Heat croons
while Jimbo thumps his bass.  People start to arrive, to partake in the
hamburgers, sausage, and hotdogs that we just barely manage not to screw up.
Marduk, after much delay, is finally convinced to go on a liquor run to the
strip.  (But who can blame him for wanting to rest up a little bit?  He'd just
got out of a 3 hour road trip...and this was HIS house we were invading...but
then again, once you get past 16, what's a party without alcohol?  Isn't alcohol
the entire basis of post pubescant social gatherings?) and more people arrive.
At this time it's still all droogs.  The filler people haven't arrived yet.  Not
quite yet.  We all arrange ourselves about the house, yard, porch.  It's a party
about this time, and not so much just a gathering of friends...different clumps
of people form, and people wander between them.  Mingle.  Then Marduk returns
from his lick'er run.  Of course Bobby [Bob tMotW] delves right in like the
glutton that he is (around beer, anyway).  Probably isn't the best thing to let
'ol Bobby drink, as he's probably the most annoying drunk person I know.  Well,
second to another, but I won't mention her, because I've spent the last...month
or two?...trying NOT to think of her.  Bleah.  Grr.  Fuck.  Party.  Part-Ae.
Groove is in the heart.  Groups of Droogs leave.  Filler people arrive.  Well,
not quite yet.  At this point it's still people that have vague associations
with the Domination.  So all is cool.  I don't expect it actually to get to the
point of losing the point (actually, the point is already lost, never was there
in the first place, 'cept when I mention it to people.  But it's in me
somewhere...surely...) All *is* cool.  Real cool.  The party is cool.  ZenMike
brought Jaffo into to town, good to see him.  He gave me a hug and called me
respectable.  Me, respectable.  Entirely.  I wander off to write this, 'cause
good 'ol Bill Hooper reminded me that I have my laptop in the car...I gotta get
away anyway...I'm not a social person.  Even among friends, too many just makes
me go into myself...So, I'm sitting here in my car, running my battery down,
listening to (now) Primus MP3s...trying to figure out what to write next...and I
don't think I have anything to write next.  So I think I'm gonna stop.  And
enjoy the rest of the party...Yeah.  I can still enjoy things...Can't I?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Lobo Licious -

Let's see.  It's July 6, and I'm finally getting around to writing about
GwaDFest.  The shit's gone down since then, but in all honesty, there's no
excuse; I'm just a lazy bastard.

I worked until 7pm on the 19th.  dEEbEE told everybody to start showing up
sometime after 5pm, so I figured the party would be kicking by the time I got
there.  I was wrong, but right.  Explain that one

We (the girl I was dating and I) finally arrived at around 8:30 or so, and there
were a few dr00gies around.  I quickly scarfed down a hamburger in a hotdog bun 
(because I was too lazy to find the hamburger buns), and we all just sort of 
stood around and talked for a while.  At this point, the party consisted of 
Diamondback, Marduk, Seth The Man, Bill Hooper, Sir Flea and his girlfriend, Bob 
the Master of the World, Bruno, Chico Cuba, the girl I was with, and me.  We sat.  
We chilled.  We sent Marduk on a beer run.  Shifty and his girlfriend arrived, 
and the PDA commenced.

Filler people also arrived, like this guy we (Bruno, Bill Hooper, and I) called
"Bolus" when we were in high school.  So anyway, I took the girl I was with home
at about 10:30 because she didn't really know anybody except for me and it was
obvious that she wasn't having very much fun.

On the way back to Marduk's house, I got lost.  It's hard to drive and read
directions at the same time.  In fact, I followed this one car for a while,
because I thought it was Priest and his roommate (which it wasn't), and it got
me even more lost.

Priest and his roommate never did show up.  Those bastards.

Anyway, I finally got back to the party, where I found Seth The Man writing his
perceptions of what was what (see above).  Marduk had returned with the beer,
and Bruno and Bob tMotW (especially the latter) had already begun to imbibe it.
Zen and Coffey had also finally arrived from Dallas, and they'd brought Jaffo 
with them.  Yancey Slide had come as well, and he'd brought a trash bag full of 
popcorn.

More filler people had arrived, but Bolus had left...I don't even remember why
we call him that.  Two groups had formed:  filler people on the porch, under the
light that attracted the bugs; and dr00gs, farther down the porch, showing our
intelligence by avoiding the light and therefore avoiding bug bites.  Zen,
Coffey, and Jaffo migrated back and forth between the two groups because they
knew some of the filler people (they'd brought most of them along).

We sat.  And we stood.  And we drank.  And we ate chips.  Bruno only mentioned
tossing salads once.  Maybe I brought it up.  I don't remember.

There were people calling themselves "Nobody" and "Somebody," and there was
probably an "Anybody," too, but I'm not sure, since I wasn't part of whatever
started that inside joke.

At one point, Jaffo, Zen, Bob tMotW, and I had an argument about who (among us
at the party) was OLD SCHOOL and who wasn't.  We ended up deciding that Jaffo
was the only truly OLD SCHOOL person (I'm still not clear on the exact
definition of this term) present, and that Zen and I were OLDer SCHOOL.  But Bob
tMotW was only MIDDLE SCHOOL, despite his protests and his claims that when he
was "Buttworm," he'd been OLD SCHOOL.  Bob was drunk at this point, thanks (in
part) to Coffey, who gave him hard liquor and wine coolers after Chico Cuba (who
was Bob's ride home) had told him not to have anymore beer.  I must confess that
I had had a few as well, so I was in a much more belligerent, argumentative mood
than normal (which is probably hard for some to imagine).  The
argument/discussion was pointless, but hey, that's the best kind of argument to
have.

Every once in a while, STM or dEEbEE would come by the circle around the popcorn
bag and shoot the shit with us for a few minutes, but then they'd wander over to
the other group or back inside.  I went in the house once, and there were Marduk
and STM, watching _Twister_ (the vilest of vile movies).  dEEbEE was, I assume,
hanging out with the filler people (person?) he'd brought from work.

The whole affair went down smoothly.  A good time was had by all, I think.

It was good to see everybody again.  Sir Flea and I haven't kept in touch too
well of late, so it was nice to hang out with him.  I hadn't seen Jaffo since
he ran off to Dallas two years or so ago, so it was really nice to talk to him.
He said something about how he'd come to the party so he could "monitor my
progress."  I'm still not sure what that means.  I hadn't really talked to Bill
Hooper much since he's been back in town, so that was cool, too.  In other
words, I really enjoyed GwaDFest because it helped renew friendships with some
really cool old friends, as well as to kick back and relax for a few hours.

In a lot of ways, it was just like the monthly GwD parties from the old days,
except we didn't watch _Hellraiser_, STM didn't shoot Sir Flea with a BB-gun,
and Rory wasn't there to make prank phone calls.  The format was the same,
though:  converge on a house, eat chips, hang out with friends, drink beverages
(in the old days, it was cokes...but hey, at least we didn't eat those chips
without liquid refreshment), have crazy conversations.  It was classic GwD:
little planning, even less organization, snack foods, and arguments with good
friends.

This write-up is a lot longer than I planned on it being, so I'm going to shut
up now.

I think something like 20-30 people overall showed up, which is pretty good,
especially given the fact that we only gave people 9 days notice.  Next time,
all we need is a little bit more planning to make it a bigger deal.  Media
coverage would be nice, too.  Yeah.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Zen -

I thought that the GTG on the 19th was tres cool and we had loads of fun seeing
all the GwD folx.  It was a good thing that we brought the Jaff-ster along to
get him out of his little anti-social shell that he has been in for the past two
years.  Great fun was had by all (well, almost all).  There were some people who
left before we got there, so there was no chance for us to kick their asses for
leaving without permission, but we put the quan on them, and they will surely
die a horrible death sometime in the near future (or not).  I, in case you
haven't guessed, am not a writer and this is about all i have to say.  I will
leave the decent writing to those who can, and I will leave it at that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Bill Hooper -

I thought it was pretty fun.  Nice getting to see everyone...and buddy [Marduk's
dog, at least according to Bruno].  And bolus.  He was a pleasant surprise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Sir Flea -

The evening began hot, sticky, and sweaty.  It was pretty warm outside too.  The
grill was burning, smoldering, waiting for the first dr00g to poke it's fiery
innards into a blaze.  The bloody meat was cooking, and our lovable cro-at was
playing with "Buddy."  That was the name given to the dog that wandered around
the house.  No one knew the dogs real name, so Bruno decided "Buddy" would be
his new one.  DB was crankin' the tunes on his "1 Billion give or take a
million" CD changer(Plus One) and the sun was finally setting.  As the droogs
began to arrive in force, a strange thing occurred.  A person none of us
recognized pulled into the driveway, and parked in the covered spots reserved
for the owners of the house.  Little did we know, that this WAS the owner of the
house we had been occupying since midday.  However, this mystery man only stayed
for a short time, as he zoomed out of the house almost immediately to acquire
some alcohol, for we ALL wanted to see "Bob the Master of the World" drink until
he was again spouting philosophy and claiming to be the Cardinal Richelieu.  It
had been entertaining at several previous GwD parties, and we were looking
forward to a repeat performance.  As Chico Cuba arrived, he immediately went to
assist with the grilling, and was soon cookin' up a heapin' helpin' of Summer
Sausage.  We all thought this strange, for Chico is jewish, and I'm pretty sure
sausage isn't on the kosher menu.  After nearly setting the farm on fire several
times, we all settled down around the citronella candles to watch the sun set.
It was a nice moment, all of us standing on the same porch, watching the same
sunset, after several months (in some cases years) of separation from each
other.  It gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside, and I'll remember that evening
for a long time.  Overall, it was a good night, no one died, or got hurt
(seriously) and we all got fed and drunk.  That's more than I can say for a lot
of other nights, and I look forward to our 10 year anniversary, where we'll be
kickin' it at the grand ol' age of our mid-twenties!  Yeah, power to the people,
and long live the Greene baby.  [wtf?  -Lobo]

Looking through all the Chaos stuff brings back happy memories of my first
modeming experiences in 8th grade (damn, I am a dork!).  Anyway, I just thought
I'd write to let you know that Chaos was the first BBS that I joined, and I have
kept the Snotty nickname ever since (which most people can't say!).

chaos is. chaos was. chaos will be forever and ever.  amen.
c'est la meme chose avec la verte.  not sure if that's right.

i was 14 years old when i first called chaos.  it changed my life.  seth the man
actually voice validated me.  it was crazy.  anyway, i sorta knew seth from
school, but i must admit that i didn't like him much.  well, when kilroy got
ratt fink (my brother, then known as sandman) and i into bbsing, we called
everywhere and were real lamers.  one day, i called chaos, but didn't think much
of it.  as time went by, i felt more at home there than on any other bbs in
lubbuttocks, with the possible exception of the snake's den (which was then run
from midnight to 7am, i believe).  this must have been late-late-late (the last
week of december or so) 1992.  with 1993 came my move up from newbie-ness and a
nice little niche in the bbs scene, mostly on chaos.  seth and i began to hang
out around that time.  we were in the same earth science class in eighth grade.
yeah.  anyway, we became fast friends, and stuff.

chaos is where i learned the 10,001 ways to skin a flea and how to get capt.
newt in a box.  these memories will be with me forever.

seth invited me to go to colorado with his family that summer, so i did. the
night before we left, he and i got this crazy idea that we should have this
text-file group and stuff and call it GwD.  chaos was on a local network at this
time, it was called fucknet, and it was administered by malachi.  anyway, chaos
is where GwD was born.  i was there when seth kept getting grounded and having
his computer taken away.  i was there when he actually registered WWIV (chaos
was WWIV reg. num 40195, [but seth always entered it wrong when he rerolled the
board, because it really didn't matter] for those who care).  i think i was
supposed to help pay for that.

oh well.  heh.

seth got this crazy idea (i think it was before the whole GwD thing began) of
having cosysops representing the incarnations of immortality from the piers
anthony(?) books.  seth was god, siva was satan, popinjay was time, and i was...
fate, i think.  not sure.  anyway, this was kinda silly.

i was there, in fact i helped, when seth got the wwiv source code and modded it.
i suggested some of the commands that didn't quite work right when we compiled
"our own" bbs software, which we called SOLiD (it was SOLiD v.3 for some reason,
we never had a 1.0 release or anything before or after .3).  i even made some of
the menus.  we later changed these menus back to the WWIV commands cuz people
were dumb and some of the commands we changed things to were already other
commands, so the bbs crashed a lot.  yeah.

i was there when big man joe (little man tate) crashed chaos (by typing "//DOS"
followed by "del *.*") cuz seth was dumb enough to believe that bmj was malachi
and he'd forgotten the system pass.  bleh.

i was there when we cheated our asses off in tradewars to kick the shit out of
everyone else.

i've been there since just after the beginning, and i'm here now.  i've changed
a lot (i've even discovered that my last name is "Licious," i'd always just
thought my name was "Lobo" without a last name), but so has the bbs.  it's not
even dial-in anymore (i miss those days), but this new [web] version rocks
almost as much as GwD.  yeah.  almost.

and that's all i have to say.

	of global media.
	
YEAR NINE:

	booster.

	Government" foreseen in _Revelation_, of course.  What the hell were you 
	thinking?
