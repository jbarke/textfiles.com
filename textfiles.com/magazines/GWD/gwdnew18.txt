gwd116.txt - "EPISODE II:  The GwD STAR WARS Special STRIKES BACK"
             Just like the title says...more STAR WARS stuff.  Exactly 50
             issues after the original GwD STAR WARS Special, we return to our
             rightful place as the unOFFICIAL STAR WARS E-ZINE with a whole
             new bunch of STAR WARS-related forwards and stuff we stole from
             elsewhere.  It's time to feed off the hype of the impending
             release of EPISODE II this May.

gwd117.txt - "The History of the Future" by The BMC
             Do you like history?  Do you like the future?  Well wait no
             longer, the two have joined forces at last!  At last, read about
             the future from a past perspective.

gwd118.txt - "Defending Redd" by Havoc
             Havoc defends Redd.  Not really.  Fuck you.

gwd119.txt - "Whoopty Woop" by Bob the Master of the World and Lobo Licious
             What do kidnapping, white-slavery, professional gambling, and
             Linkin Park have in common?  Read this article of articles to
             find out the answers to these and other pressing questions.
             Don't forget about Pillows.

gwd120.txt - "SKLUH, GLUH, GLAAAHHHH!" by Otis
             Helpful hints for the neophyte amateur porn star.  "What sounds
             do I make when I...?"  Otis has the answers, boys and girls, and
             he's more than willing to share.

rr0101.txt - Vol.1, Issue 1 - "OKAY, IT'S NOT IDIOT LIST" by j3ph
             The foundation is laid.  _Retail Retards_ will teach you (yes,
             *YOU*) how to behave properly in a retail environment.  The first
             installment gives you a few hints as to what not to do.  A must
             read for the serious (and not-so-serious) shopper.

rr0102.txt - Vol.1, Issue 2 - "Don't Be a Dumbass, Part I" by Miggedy

gwd006.mp3 - "The Vision" by Bob Larson (Ratt Fink remix)
             Yes, THE Bob Larson.  Taking on the Clinton Crowd AND the Devil's
             crowd, in Lubbock, no less.  Word word word.  The shitty quality
             is due to the fact that this was recorded from the radio and
             mixed on cassette tape, then transferred to mp3 via a Walkman(tm)
             and an unnecessarily long cord.

gwd007.mp3 - "AM" by Record Breakers
             Record Breakers, a hot new hip-hop combo (complete with horns)
             lends us this song, from their _Raji_ EP, available from I Like
             Apple Juice Records (http://www.ilikeapplejuice.com/).  Bob tMotW
             plays drums.  This is like nothing you've ever heard.

gwd008.mp3 - "Muhahahaha" by Napalm
             What the fuck is so funny?

gwd009.mp3 - "Osiris" by Record Breakers
             You gots to support your own, aww-haw.

gwd010.mp3 - "Chicken Aweigh" by Priest
             This is a chicken.  He's going aweigh.  Away, even.  Yeah.

-> HEADLINES <-

We're releasing new audio files for your listening displeasure.  Yay.  There's
some text, too.  Yeah.  Why are we still doing this?  Fuck you.

Since all you fuckers care about is the photos on the site, oodles of them
were added in late March.  Look at them, or don't.  Drop us a line and let us
know just what in the fuck is so great about our lame-ass photos that you
Australian and New Zealander fuckers have to look at them all the time.  The
Southern Hemisphere pisses me off.

GwD PUBLICATIONS SIGNS LUCRATIVE DISTRIBUTION DEAL WITH SCUMDOG ENTERTAINMENT

GwD Publications is co-hosting/distributing a new journal, _Retail Retards_
(aka _'TARDZ_).  This is published by SCUMDOG ENTERTAINMENT and is distributed
exclusively through GwD Publications at http://www.GREENY.org/pubz/tardz/ (or
http://scumdog.GREENY.org/text/tardz/).  Read it, live it, love it.

GwD Pubz is proud to announce that is is (and has been for some time) the sole 
online repository for j3ph's short-lived _EAST TEXAS IDIOT LIST_, another fine 
SCUMDOG ENTERTAINMENT production.  Look for it at 
http://www.GREENY.org/pubz/etil/ (or http://scumdog.GREENY.org/text/etil/).  

Word.

The retards now have their tubes.

               -*- "Snoodling foreskin munching and more!" -*-

-> OTHER NEWS <-

"GwD -- The College Years" will continue for another year or so.  Check local
listings for time and station.  This season, Bob tMotW and Lobo Licious will
enter a new place called "grad school."  Apparently, according to Bill Hooper
(who's been in grad school for a while now), they can expect it to "suck a big
fat nut."  That's right, COLLEGE IS STILL OVERRATED.

     -*- "Boys will be girls.  MMM-HMMM.  I loves me some she-males!" -*-

-> SUBMISSION INFORMATION <-

If you have ANYTHING to submit to GwD (artwork, text, outlandish claims,
etc.), DO NOT HESITATE to send it our way.  "submit@GREENY.org" is there for
you, baby.  Work must be 100% original and it must be understood that once
submitted, articles/artwork/photographs become the property of GwD, Inc.
(unless they have been previously published elsewhere) and we can use them
however we see fit, even if it's merely to make fun of them (and you).

                 -*- "We just want your cum in our faces!" -*-

-> LETTERS TO THE EDITOR <-

Got a comment/question/complaint/rant?  Send 'em our way.  editor@GREENY.org
is always waiting for your e-mails.

[All spelling/grammar errors are those of the author(s) and are not errors on
the part of GwD, cuz, well, we're perfect.  Yeah.]
