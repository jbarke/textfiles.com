Welcome to Issue 1, volume 2 of FBI PRESENTS. Our third issue.  This file
should be released under the following names:
FBI0003.ZIP
-0003.FBI
-0003.EXE
FBI.2.1.Z

The Zip file contains the magazine, and Newsletter formats of our 
publication, while the FBI.2.1.Z only contains the Newsletter.  The 
newsletter is for NON-IBM readers, and mailing or printing.  The MAGAZINE 
format is brand new.

  OUR NEW FORMAT:
     Yes, we here at FBI have decided upon a new format for our publications. 
This new format consists of an EXE file.  This file, when run, will show our 
logo in beautiful VGA color, or if you do not have VGA an ANSI one.  Next you 
will come to an index.  The index consists of a listing of each article, 
number of pages in the article, and number of pictures, or animations.  You 
can select to just look at the pictures, such as a normal MAGAZINE, or you 
can read the articles, and see the nice pictures.  There will even be an 
option to send an article to your Printer.  I hope you like this new format..  
If not you can always read the old newsletter format, mind you, diagrams will 
look much better in VGA or ANSI.  Some time in the future, we may even add 
Adlib support.. but this is still in question.

  OUR APOLOGY:

     Yes, I owe you people out there an apology.  FBI was running strong for 
awhile, until that dreaded event.  My HD crashed.  All data for issue 3 was 
completely lost.  I had to start from scratch.  Soon, with many problems, I 
gave up, and was content to just let the MAGAZINE die.  But I received a call 
one night from Balthazar.  He urged me to Re-Start FBI.  And with his help.. 
I am now able to bring you this..  FBI RETURNS.

Special Thanx go to:
Mitch Kapor
Balthazar
Levi-First Speaker

You guys made my dream of putting FBI back together possible.

Contact me at au530@cleveland.freenet.edu
Send articles, praise, requests, criticisms.. whatever..


The new staff of FBI:
Editor In Chief- Garbled User
Staffing Coordinator- Balthazar
Assistant Editor- Sentinel
Artists-Scorpion
        Eights

We are hiring.. so send me some info on you, and an example of your work.. And 
you could make it in!

     You all remember Acid Reign's Tennis Ball Bomb (detailed in Issue 1-1 of 
FBI Presents).  Well, we built a few, but wanted a way to make them MORE 
deadly, MORE effective, and increase the range!

     What was left to do?  Launch them out of a cannon!


Chapter Primero:

     To build your low scale weapon of destruction, you will need the 
following easy-to-obtain equipment!

 CANNON:
(1) Length of 3 inch diameter PVC tubing.  Approximately 4'8"
(1) PVC end cap. Must plug the pipe up at one end.
(1) Handy-Dandy Charcoal Lighter Wand.

 TOOLS:
(1) Drill.
(1) Small Triangular Metal File.
(1) Bottle of PVC Glue.
(1) Tube of Epoxy Cement.
(1) Handsaw.
(2) 4" C-Clamps.

 FUELS:
Any of the following fuels can be used, each with a different result.
Naphtha,Xylene,Acetone,95% Ethyl Alcohol,Paint Thinner.

 SHELLS:
Tennis balls, or Tennis Ball Bombs

 Optional Equipment:
(4) Additional feet of PVC.
(1) U Attachment.
(1) 1x6x6" Plank.
(1) Spool Of Mister-Hamster Duct Tape.
(1) Propane tank. (Used in Propane Burners)
(2) Tank Attachments. (Used to adjust flow of propane in a burner)
(1) Oxygen Tank. (One that fits the Tank Attachments)


To build the basic design, It will cost about 12-16 bux in supplies.  Try 
your local TRUE-Value.. (Or consult a thief)

Chapter The Next:

  Building Your Toy.

  This is a wee bit complicated, but as usual, will be presented in a simple 
step-by-step process.

1)  Cut eight inches off the end of your PVC piping.

2) Make two parallel cuts LENGTHWISE on your eight inch tube. EXACTLY 1 inch 
apart. The tube should make a C shape.

3) Using your C-Clamps, compress one end of the small tube, so that it fits 
inside the larger tube.  If it does not fit, try sanding, or adjusting the 
C-Clamps.  A hammer helps.  Pound this tube 1 inch into the longer tube.  
Coat the outside of the small tube with epoxy.  Hammer it the rest of the way 
in, being careful not to mis-align the gap you just closed.  Make it flush 
with the end of the tube.

4) Place your End Cap on the OPPOSITE end.  Glue on with PVC cement.

5) Now drill a hole about 1/4" in the PVC tube.  It should be about 8-10 
inches away from the end cap.  Use the file to make it so your Charcoal 
Lighter fits neatly inside this hole, extending to about the center of the 
tube.

 ===--------------------------------------========
|            ,
 ===--------/-----------------------------========
          //
        //

Your finished product should look something like this.  Let dry.


Chapter The Third:
   Customizing Your Cannon

Using the extra PVC and the U tube, one can create a cannon TWICE as 
powerful... with a little work.
      ________________
     (___________|__
               /

( : U tube.
/ : Lighter.
| : Block of wood.


Simply take your block of wood, and cut a V into each end.  Duct tape this 
in between the 2 tubes to prevent the U tube from cracking.  The end plug 
should again be near the lighter, and the special end you had to create in 
steps 1-3 should be the top tube in the drawing.

With some work and practice, this design is EXTREMELY effective.


Chapter Of The Four:
  Loading and firing your cannon.

Assuming you are using the basic design.. follow these steps.

1) Pour about 1/2 a cup of fuel into the tube, along the sides.

2) Take your tennis ball, and wrap with cling-wrap.

3) Stuff tennis ball inside tube about 3 inches deep.  It should be a tight 
fit.

4) Shake cannon vigorously for a short while.

5) Aim your cannon at the intended target and fire.

6) Smile as you blow the target into cosmic dust.


Chapter of Five:
   Theory Of Operation.

     The Thermal Cannon(tm) works under the Air Fuel Explosion concept.  
Therefore, there must be sufficient air left inside the cannon to support 
combustion.  Experimentation will lead you to a good amount.  One note is, 
the first 2 shots from the cannon NEVER work.  This is the warm up period for 
the cannon.  After this, normal results can be expected.  So before use, 
always fire off a few shots to get it ready.

   The fuel inside the cannon, when lit, will react EXPLOSIVELY with the 
oxygen in the air, producing a large fireball, and pushing the tennis ball 
out the end.  With work, and many hours of practice, the cannon can achieve 
ranges of up to 100' high firing mortar style.  A good shot from the cannon 
can generally knock someone over, let alone detonate a tennis ball.

  It is also completely legal.  This does NOT mean you can shoot a cop car, 
and expect to get away with it.  It means you can walk around with one.

Chapter the Last:
   Additional Ideas.

Try adding a propane tank to it, for faster re-fueling and firing.
Also add an oxygen tank to increase potency.
Make an added compression chamber with a T tube, to add more explosion area!
Use Calcium Carbide and Water as fuel!
Add an air pump to re-fresh the air supply after each firing.  It tends to 
fill with smoke after a few shots.


       Well all, Me and Gunner wish you well.  We have had many MONTHS of 
enjoyment with our toy.. and wish to spread it to you.. with this.. I bid 
farewell..

              *****************************************

     Welcome to social engineering 101E.  Basically we're here to teach you 
the art of deception.  Most of the FBI/Anarchy/etc. files are gaged toward the 
production, detonation, dispersion of explosives, the rights of the criminal 
and basic anarchist, fraud, extortion...basically the american way.  These 
are the many ways to cause chaos and disruption throughout the public and 
certain organized groups (cops, military).

     Well...a good anarchist is only productive until caught.  You can only 
get so much info. out of the computer.  Sometimes you must rely on info. 
attained by a human being.  Yes though revolting as it is you must sometimes 
communicate with these stability loving toads.  This is where social 
engineering plays a major role.  Basically you must bullshit well, and when 
you have fine tuned this skill, it serves you well.

     Introducing Social Engineering:

     This file was not created by a "good liar", nor was it the child who 
could forge his mother's name on a report card. I registered for college as a 
declared major of social sciences in the intention of becoming a 
psychologist.  Basically being paid to fuck with people's minds.  Over my 
years of experience I have found that the human mind can be twisted, changed 
to believe and do anything you wish, using the right words, phrases and 
actions.  I have compiled my accumulated skills and presented my knowledge as 
a personal favor for Garbled User.

Section one: Lying

     There are many out there who may know how to lie.  Possibly quite well,  
yet the best liar is one who can make himself believe his own lies.  By doing 
so you eliminate the common trip ups of getting caught not knowing what to 
say.  To effectively do so you must play out the scenario you have created.  
To actually put yourself inside your lie.  "When I tell someone I did this, 
what did I actually do? Say? Feel?"  After awhile it becomes common practice 
to do so whenever you plan to deceive a person.

     Example:
         I once wanted to get out of work early for a concert.  Now it would 
have been meaningless to tell the truth.  I needed something to say that 
would get me out of work immediately.  "My grandmother had passed out and was 
at the hospital. I needed to leave, Now!"  Simply saying this would not have 
been believed.  You must BELIEVE that it actually happened, that you're 
worried.

    Running in after I made sure that management knew I had used the phone, 
out of breath of course (because I was quite worried, with a hint of 
desperation in my voice) " I...my grandmother..passed out. I have to go!"  An 
immediate "Yes!" was my answer.

     Although that may seem simple and elementary it has infinite 
applications.  Such as the time I needed the number to a mainframe.  I simply 
found the name of one of the security guards, I called in.  Calmly "Yes this 
is X, (using the first name only as to suggest familiarity) I was supposed to 
load in the new security file and update the license plates today. Well, 
(touch of embarrassment) I forgot. (This is a secretary mind you, not one 
known to exhibit untrusting overtones, slightly stupid and not familiar to 
regular security proceedings involving "mistakes") I usually just work on the 
mainframe in this but if this isn't in tomorrow morning, my job is in 
jeopardy. (a favor encourages mercy trust...also an action you must make that 
her herself cannot do that adjusts her lifestyle such as a late payroll is 
effective) I have a private room with a modem (slight confusion on the terms) 
and plan to erase the buffer after use (again more confusion but a suggestion 
that you plan to use caution and are acting responsibly) I just need the 
number to the mainframe (sounds like a reasonable request after all this).

     "Sure the number is XXX-XXXX."

     Success, now the info can be used by the experienced hacker for personal 
gain, stored for future reference or the mainframe can be trashed.  Simple 
huh?

     Alright hopefully I have explained the usefulness of social eng.

Section two: Manipulation

     There's a way to get what you want, hurt who you want, help who you want 
all without seeming to be anywhere near the situation.  This is called 
manipulating the public to serve your means.

     First off, you must understand that to effectively pull this off and to 
remain a second party is that you need to stay as far from the situation as 
possible, or make it seem so.  I have used this method to get through to 
people who seemed unreachable and to destroy those who have crossed me.

     The most important point one must recognize is the importance of a trust 
built up with the intended person who is to me manipulated into doing what 
you want.  Other times a overlying feeling of distrust is effective.  I will 
explain each situation's concept.

     Trust, most easily attained in the stupid people (BELIEVE me they are 
rampant in the world).  If a person trusts you they will more likely do 
things that you ask or suggest without thinking, especially if it is a 
spontaneous thing that they are asked to do, not giving them time to think.

     Situation:

        A person has done something that society, (school, work, home) would 
not approve of.  You find out (Using your methods above) yet you're the only 
one that knows.  You want to make that person think that someone told
"everybody", perhaps the most likely person is their best friend whom you 
hate.  The one dumb idiot whom will do anything for you (perhaps a nerd or 
other social outcast whom you've barely put up with and he is thankful for 
it) Tell him to go over to the group he/she may be in and say something that 
no one but the intended person will understand.  If this is repeated enough 
the person will suspect the "best friend (or college)."  Then you can slowly 
leak the info you've attained and then that person's suspections will 
solidify.

     There you've successfully hurt or destroyed the reputation of both 
people.  Effective? ya! it works, quite well....trust me.

Section three: Deception

     Deception/misinformation is much like lying.  It causes those who 
believe it to act accordingly using reference to that which you have said.  
You can therefore change the truth in a confined area of reference and allow 
the rest of society to go on as normal which doesn't raise much attention 
allowing you to go with your business unmolested by society.

     Situation:

         There was a case that was investigated by the FBI (the real FBI) 
where by the use of misinformation, numerous people were convinced that they 
were under arrest and prosecuted, sent to jail and never allowed to leave.  
In actuality there was a slave ring operated in the Mid-western United 
States.  (Slave trade is still a thriving underground business in Asia, 
close to $100,000 a head) Anyway...it was successfully pulled off until a 
revolt broke out. But the point is something like this can happen in the USA.


     In summary, setting the world on fire, is only part.  A large portion 
rests on pulling it off and staying uninstitutionalized.  The following issues 
will go into detail concerning each of the issues described here and more.

                        "What leads man to do as he does
                         is far more fascinating than what
                         man does because of it."

 I also have a list of books, these being on explosives and demotions.

     Hacking on Internet is easy. Internet is an information communications
network consisting of around 30,000 university, buisiness and government agency
computer systems all over the world. It is also connected in one way or another
to other networks like BITNET, Compuserve, and yes..Fidonet. Most systems 
directly on internet are mainframes, but you can connect to anything from a 
CRAY to even an amiga connected at 9600 baud to the net via ALTERNET or some 
other public network communication line service. For many, the biggest trick 
is obtaining a local dialup. If there isn't one then you could allways call 
long-distance to a BBS that charges you for internet access. OR, if your like 
most that read FBI mags, you'll phreak and hack your way in. I'm not going to
attempt to explain how to phreak in this article, but hack, yeah. 

- OBTAINING A DIALUP

    1. If you live near a university then give them a call saying your a 
       student and you need to find out where you can get the number to
       connect to their computer system there, blah, blah.

    2. Large Buisinesses or government agencies may have computers on internet. 
       Call those and social engineer the numbers out of them.
  
    3. Systems on X.25 (Tymnet/Telenet/etc) can have internet access. PCP and
       Sprintnet outdials work, but they are usually slow. 

    4. Last resort: (808)-988-7611,3191,5018 then type connect <IP Number>
       Where <IP #> is in the form #.#.#.# Such as: 129.57.7.7 Restricted
       like hell. 

===============================================================================
- BASIC COMMANDS TO GET AROUND UNIX

  Unix is easy once you get used to it. It's not so hard a switch from MSDOS.
  It's a hell of alot better than MSDOS, that's all. Here is a list of basic
  commands. If you don't know anything or very little about Unix, then these
  should get you started. You can't do much of shit if you don't know some
  of them.

  NOTE: EVERYTHING IN UNIX IS CASE SENSITIVE

  man - Online manual. Not every Unix has this command, but it will give you
        a good index and explanation on every/most command(s) there are. Abuse
        this. If man doesn't work, try help.
  ls  - brief listing of files in your CWD (Current Working Directory)
        There are options to this. ls -l will give a long listing.
  cd  - Change to directory. cd <directory> cd .. <- back up a directory
        cd ~ Zaps you to your home directory. cd / is main root directory
  rm  - Remove a file. rm <filename> rm -r <directory>  <- wipes out all
  ren - rename file or directory. 
  telnet - opens a terminal to another sys. telnet <enter> then open <address>
  ftp - let's you send and receive files to and from other systems.
        ftp <enter> then open <address>. Once you are connected log in as
        anonymous and type whatever you want for a password. Not all systems
        allow anonymous logins with ftp, but most do. ls and cd work the same 
        as regular unix ? gives you help. Use help <command>. To transfer a 
        file into your account type get <filename> and wait for a few. 
        (56kbit connections!)

===============================================================================
- INFORMATION SOURCES / MAIL

  There are lots of services. USENET is one of them. There is also networked
  mail. The commands may be different or non-existant for your system, but
  I'll write them anyway.

- Sending Mail

  mhmail <user>@<host> -subject "SUBJECT IN QUOTES LIKE THIS"

  If mhmail does nothing then try mail. There are different mail systems out 
  there. You'll have to mess around to find out where your mail is kept and
  how to use it. On most systems, everything is documentated online so get
  ready to read alot more than mail. On my system the mail is kept in 
  the Mail/inbox directory and mhmail is the command to send mail and take
  mail and shove it into my mailbox so I can read it.

- USENET

  USENET is useful. It's made up of 1000s of public posting groups (newsgroups)
  You can find a newsgroup that deals with allmost any topic you can think of.
  The command that I use to read these groups is:

  rn

  This fires up everything I need to read and post messages. There are many 
  commands you can use, but just like everything else, typing h will get you
  a list of commands and help on them. Here are a few:

  l <subject> searches through all the newsgroup names for the pattern that 
              matches the subject you are looking for.
  g <newsgroup> subscribe to a newsgroup. g alt.hack will subscribe you to
                alt.hack and you will be prompted to read the messages.
  = while you are in a newsgroup you can list out all the subjects of every
    message with the =. Then write down the numbers of the messages and type
    them in when after you have reached the end of the messages.
  # Reads <message number>
  s Saves the current message in a file. The file is named after the newsgroup
    and is stored in the News directory on my system. It should tell you where
    it was written.

There are many more information services that you can connect to. You will
find out more when you connect to ---> 
                                           
===============================================================================
- IRC (INTERNET RELAY CHAT)

   IRC is a way to talk to other people on systems that are capable of 
   connecting to others on the net with telnet. There are usually around
   300 users at once on IRC and roughly 50 differnet topic channels to 
   talk to other users on. There are a few ways to get to irc.

   Client service:

     A Client is the best way to reach IRC since it doesn't go through a mess
     of bullshit, it's easy to use and you can see what's going on. Some 
     systems allready have irc set up and all you have to type is irc just
     like any other unix command. If you don't have it on your system then
     you have to get a client from somewhere. The best way to find one is to 
     look for users that are on the same system as you are and ask them what 
     they are doing to get there. Make them tell you.   

   Telneting to an IRC Client: 

     I only know of one place right now that will let you telnet right to it
     and kick you to an IRC Client. It's really slow, but it works and it's
     mostly dependable. It should be around for a long time at least.

     To do it:

     telnet bradenville.andrew.cmu.edu

     After you type this, you will see what to do to log on, etc.

 - IRC Commands:

   Here are the ones you really need to know:

   /nick <nickname> Change your nickname.
   /list Lists all the channels by thier topics
   /join <channel> Joins a channel so you can talk to users that are in it.
                   You must you the # before the channel name like this:
                   /join #hack
  /msg <nickname> <message> Sends a private message to whoever <nickname>
  /who * Lists all that are in the current channel
  /who <address> List's everyone that is on the same system as you.
  /help Hmmmm.
  /quit Hmmmmm.

It's a good idea to get right into irc. You can get alot of help with stuff
and find out information on anything you want, whether legal or maybe-not-legal

===============================================================================
- BASIC HACKING WHILE ON THE NET / PASSWORD CRACKING

 Hopefully you have a UNIX account. There aren't too many operating systems out
 there, but from what I've messed around with, Unix is the best and it's also
 geared towards the hacker. It's a security orientated security hole. Even with
 new holes being literally patched now and then, there are still enough holes
 to keep yourself on internet by cracking passwords and grabbing other systems'
 password files. The entire list of accounts and passwords for a single system
 is located in one public file. The passwords are encrypted with DES, and thus 
 irreversable, but apply the same DES algorythm on every word in a good sized 
 dictionary and compare each result with the original encrypted password and 
 you can put together a great list of accounts. One system I'm on (SUN MP670) 
 does 3000 'cracks' every second which is slow really... 

- Location of the password file:

  /etc/passwd    (Most systems)

This is located off the main root directory. Do a cd /etc then you will be in
the directory that contains the file - passwd. passwd is an ASCII text file
that lists every account line by line and includes name, encrypted password,
user id, real name, directory and shell program for every account.

- Cracking passwd:

 You should get a copy of Killer Cracker, Crack4 or some other cracker to do 
 the job. Crack4.0a is available at:

      nic.sura.net  directory /pub/security/programs/unix/Crack
      get the filename: crack4.0a.tar.Z

 This file is archived (.tar) and compressed (.Z) do:

    uncompress crack4.0a.tar.Z
    tar xvf crack4.0a.tar  (xvf - x means eXtract v is View. <filename> after f)
    cd crack4.0  (To change into the crack directory)
    Crack /etc/passwd  (Begin cracking)

 Check back with it in a few days or whatever. Since it's run as a background 
 process you can hang up and call back and it will still be running. (That is 
 if the sysadmins don't kill it)
 
   The list of cracked passwords is stored in a file called out.something
   'something' is a number. The process number actually. To stop cracking 
    you have to kill the process. Type:

      kill 574782  if your output file is say.. out.574783

- Getting password files from other systems:

     Really simple. This seems to work on 2% of the systems out there, you 
     never know what kind of security holes you can find though.

 Type tftp <system address>

    tftp nic.sura.net      (Don't bother with this address)

 Then:

    get /etc/passwd

Wait awhile. Anything could happen now. Most likely it'll crap out, but you may
notice a large file called passwd in your current dir after you go through with
this. (Unlikely though, but I've found a few)

- Finger

    On most systems you can see who is on a certain system by using telnet in
    a certain way. By using what's known as port services you can initiate
    certain services on other machines with telnet. Port 79 will simply just 
    dump out a list of account names. You then can brute force hack these out 
    if you want. To use:

       telnet <address> 79
ex:    telnet nic.sura.net 79

                Improvised smoke canister (electric ignition)

  This is a simply improvised device that can be used in place of commercial 
smoke canisters with pull-ring ignition.  This article is only concerned with 
the canister device itself and assumes you know how to produce the desired 
smoke formula and are familiar with electric ignition.  Materials you will 
need are, 

-a standard "pop-top" beverage can (not opened)
-a small wooden block (approx. 1 cm a side)
-a paper clip
-a small piece of metal foil
-glue and tape
-a battery of required voltage
-wire
-an ignitor
-smoke formula

  Construction is rather simple.  Take the can and use a knife to cut off the 
top of the can as cleanly as possible, draining the contents as you go.  
Rinse and dry the sections, then take the upper section and glue the wooden 
block right behind the hinged end of the (pop-top) lid. Position the 
PAPER CLIP on the block so it will make contact with the lid when it is opened 
about 45 degrees.  Glue the PAPER CLIP in position and attach a wire to it.  
Next, attach a wire to the foil and then glue the foil to the bottom the lid. 
Finish the wiring to the battery and ignitor using the PAPER CLIP/lid-foil as 
a switch equivalent. Finally, place a package of the smoke formula in the 
bottom section and insert the ignitor.  To seal the canister, place the 
sections flush together and secure them with tape, or glue the seam first for 
a better seal.  This completes the manufacture of the improvised electric 
ignition smoke canister. 

  The functioning of this canister is also very simple.  To use, simply open 
the the canister as you would a normal beverage.  When the lid is pressed 
down the foil makes contact with the PAPER CLIP, completing the circuit and 
igniting the smoke formula.  The resulting smoke exits the canister through 
the opened lid.

     /___________________________________________________________\

     This month's Chemistry Corner is dedicated to a nice little liquid.
Nitrogen TriChloride

     This is a simple, yet destructive chemical, which can be made by a few 
easy steps. But first, as always, a background, and description of the 
chemical.

     This chemical was first brought to my attention in the terrorist's 
handbook. Which glorified it as an easy to make liquid that would blow up. 
Well that was fine and dandy. So I tried the little reaction, and nothing. A 
waste of good Chlorine gas.

     The formula for Nitrogen Trichloride is NCl3. It is a simple Nitrogen 
atom combined to three chlorine atoms.  The molecule is non-polar, and cannot 
be dissolved in water.  It is an oily yellow substance.

     The substance is made from Chloroamine, another explosive liquid.  THis 
explosive has a FP of -66C and is also simple to make.

STEP 1

     You will need the following supplies.
Distilling column.
3 250ml Erlenmyer Flasks.
Some rubber and glass tubing.
Rubber stoppers for the flasks.
Ammonia Water (NH4OH)
Chlorine Bleach.

STEP 2

     Cool one flask to approximately 0C.  Add to this flask 100ml of ammonia 
water. Place 100ml of Ammonia Water and 100ml of bleach in the other flask.  
Heat the second flask to about 80C.  Run a tube from one flask, into the 
other.  The tube should begin bubbling gas through the Ammonia solution.  
Continue this until you have run out of gas from the generator.  This gas is 
chlorine gas. Do not Breathe.

     You now have NH2Cl in solution.  This substance is explosive in it's 
solid, or liquid states. But it is fully stable in the gas phase, or in 
solution.  Such as it is now.

     Should you want to use this explosive for your purposes, simply distill 
it with the distilling column.

STEP 3

     OK..  Now add enough Sulferic Acid to the solution until the PH is under 
3.  Test this with a few strips of PH paper, readily available form your 
classroom, or science supply store.

     In a few minutes, with LIGHT heating (approx 40C) an oily liquid should 
start to form.  When the oil droplets fall to the bottom, STOP THE HEATING!

STEP 4

     Carefully draw out the droplets with an eyedropper, and use them within 
24 hours.  They tend to decompose.  To make sure you have NCl3, simply 
preform the following SAFE test.  Take a metal spoon, and place about 2 drops 
of the substance in it.  Heat with a small flame (lighter, gas stove, 
whatever) The droplets should explode.  If not.. Try again..


     There you have it people.. A safe(not) fun, explosive.  Feel free to 
kill your neighbors with it.  Feed it to your pet!

                        SEASONAL ANARCHY!
By:Garbled User

     Welcome to FBI Present's latest seasonal column.  Every season, we will 
bring to you a new form of anarchy, that can be fun, but only for that 
season! None of these tactics are really deadly, so you can have fun with 
them, and not cause much damage.

  Weddings:
     Me and Gunner were sitting here trying to think up some seasonal 
activities for spring, when we chanced upon weddings.  His suggestion was to 
napalm the wedding.. but this goes a bit far.  What can you do?  Soak the 
flowers in Liquid Nitrogen. When the bride throws em. <CRISHH> Little flower 
bits everywhere.  I thought of tarring and feathering the bride, but maybe 
that's going to far.  You could always grease the aisle, so they slip all 
over hell.  Or pull the rug out from under them.  Make xeroxed pictures of 
the bride with the best man, or the priest.  Get a little tape recorder in 
the back, and have it wait until the priest says, "Does anyone object to this 
wedding?" Have it say, "But you said you loved only ME last NIGHT!" In a 
female voice.  Tuns o' fun!

  School:
Xerox a few school calendars, with the spring break one week in advance.

  Church:
You all know how to drain an egg right?  Poke a hole with a pin, and pour all 
the stuff out.  Now color these eggs and put them around on the egg hunt.  
Better yet, put eggs that you DIDN'T hard boil out. "Wow mommy, can I eat one 
now?" CRACK, SPLASH, EWWW!  Or just throw eggs at the hunters.  Colored eggs 
that is.

  Home:
Some wimps use their air conditioners in the spring.  Show these electricity 
wasters a taste of chaos when you fill their AC with powdered sugar, and it 
fills the room.  Bomb houses with eggs and hit the windows,  They'll go right 
through the screens!  Leave the bags on vacuum cleaners open, WHOOSH, dust 
everywhere!  Plant flowers on your friends carpeting... that should be fun to 
watch.. "Ooh dear, these are so precious." "Get these fucking things off my 
carpet!" "But DEEEAAARRRRRRR!"

  Out of doors:
Plug up a few drain sewers with plastic bags, the whole street will flood!  
Pour washing soda all over a street, when the rain falls, the whole street 
will start to bubble up.  Poison bits of people's lawn to ruin the grass, 
make cool things like checkerboards, and obscenities!  Or just make little 
paths going everywhere.  Plant a fast growing tree in your friend's lawn, 
when he wakes up and their seems to be 4 trees instead of 3, he will freak.  
Or start slowly cutting branches off his tree, until just the trunk is left.  
He will have no clue.  Steal all the fruit from a tree, just before it's 
ripe.  Poison his tree, so he has a huge dead tree in his yard. "Gosh, trees 
are a bit slow this year."  Flood his basement by sticking a hose in an open 
window.  Put poison in his bird feeder.  Get a BB gun and peg birds off the 
house while he or she is watching them.  Leave dead birds, cats, dogs, 
elephants, etc. lying around his yard and driveway.  Mow your lawn, and dump 
the grass clippings on his roof.  Next rain and they clog the drains, soaking 
everything, and coating the whole area with a sludge.  Set the top of one of 
his trees on fire at about three AM and call the fire department.  Leave 
piles of grass on his lawn, and above his front door, so he gets covered when 
he opens the door.  Those things ITCH.  Put grass in his dryer, so all his 
clothing turns green.  Pour bleach on all the clothes left out on the line, 
or fill them with itching powder.  Best of all, pour gasoline in his anthills 
and drop a match.  His whole yard will explode. Anthills are QUITE extensive. 
Steal a tree in the middle of the night.  Replant all his flowers upside 
down.  Carve obscene figures in his bushes and shrubbery. Glue his welcome mat 
to his front door.

Automobiles:
  Cover the hood of your friend's car with ELMER'S glue.  When he starts 
driving, the whole thing will flake off, and create a neet effect.  If you 
really want to be nasty, put push pins in his windshield wipers.  Fill 
someone's car with water, so when he opens the door, WHOOSH, he's soaked. 
Coat a car with grass clippings and elmer's glue.  Plant flowers in his 
trunk. Paint his lights black.  Pull the rubber things out of his wipers.  
Pull bits and pieces off his tinting to make cool effects.  Leave spilt coke 
on his hood. 


But most of all.. HAVE FUn!  Anarchy is yours to cause.  Don't just do what I 
have here.. These are merely beginnings!  Strike out. Find new ways to cause 
chaos..  Maybe you don't like some of these ideas.  Don't do them, make 
something up.. I care.  Just go out there, and enjoy the season while it 
lasts, summer is on it's way!  And so is a whole new range of chaos to cause.

Legal Hacking Introduction

by Nombrist Beor

This is basically what I am working on currently..I haven't got a lot of it 
nailed down yet and the second half is just random stuff from my notes..a 
sort of breaker to what I've dug up (the reason it is total randomness and 
chaos). I used it because I was trying to come up with real world examples of 
where this shit is being used right now and working.

We, the PEOPLE; the hackers, the druggies, the criminal elite, the nazis, 
pinkos, fags, manual laborers, ethnic minorities, ethnic majorities, 
businessmen, singers, actors, housewives, and anyone who I might just 
happened to have missed, are being fucked over for even TRYING to defend our 
rights.

Until about 2 years ago, I thought that you only got out of court four ways: 
get screwed, have enough money to pay a good lawyer, get out on a 
technicality, or get real lucky in a jury trial.

I was wrong. There are specific things you can do before it even gets that 
far. What I'm going to try to do is give some suggestions for possible 
methods using some fictional and some real examples while show the method.

Before you even bother with any of this, please make absolutely sure that you 
have looked up each citation you plan on using from here yourself in the 
local legal library. Most lawyers have fairly good, but usually lacking 
collections. Most county seats have a fairly decent legal library some place 
in the court house that is open to the public. I'm going to quote almost 
everything by U.S. Reporter numbers, but the Supreme Court Reporter might 
have them because it is similar to a 'best of' anthology.

Anytime you see a key word (such as jurisdiction, title, ownership, equity, 
common law, admissions, confessions, signature, date of birth, etc.), LOOK IT 
UP! The language of law is almost totally different from everyday use. For 
instance, the term Federal Reserve Note is a misnomer because 'note' 
indicates value. Dollars is ambiguous (sort of like saying I want a peck, a 
peck of what?) The best way I can think of is that while you're at the legal 
library, look up the definitions in 3 dictionaries and 2 encyclopedias. 
Lawyers just don't want to be like anyone else, so they have their own 
versions of these things. Corpus Juris Secundum and American Jurisprudence 
will probably be around some place (they are huge) and are okay, but usually 
pretty vague. Blacks Law Dictionary (one thick volume), to be perfectly 
honest, sucks, but all lawyers use it because it's cheap ($30 on the average 
in a good book store). Bouvier's Law Dictionary (the older the better..the 2 
volume 1914 edition is the best but almost impossible to find) is far better 
if it is available. Another dictionary that is easy to understand that looks 
more like the size of a normal encyclopedia set and is a light blue color, 
usually where all the other dictionaries are, is called Words and Phrases. 
It's a toss-up between Bouvier's and Words and Phrases, but Words and Phrases 
is usually easier to understand, even if it contradicts itself sometimes. 

Second, all these legal citations will be something like:

Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 174 (1803)

That is, plaintiff vs. defendant, volume reporter pages (date)

Some of these are usually missing. Famous cases, such as Miranda v. Arizona, 
don't even have numbers anymore (everyone is 'assumed' to know what you're 
talking about). Date is often missing, but becomes useful with contradicting 
cases. Reporters are abbreviated almost always and usually only the first 
page of a case is listed.

A citation is a reference to a specific place in a set of books. Each court 
that passes what it considers to be major cases places a copy in a series of 
books that get published every so often. The reason is a principle known as 
'Stare Decisis', aka let the decision stand. If a court has ruled on a 
similar case in the past, assuming they follow Stare Decisis (in this 
country, not doing so is considered a grave injustice, but they get away with 
it all the time), then the decision should be the same. That way, you can 
make your case by showing all previous similar cases and showing how yours is 
the same or different.

Here we come to a slight problem..the law says one thing and another more 
authoritative document says another. This is a rather tricky thing to answer. 
If you acknowledge a law as law, that makes it legal, though it may be 
unlawful. Here's some examples of where that has happened in the past:

"If the legislature clearly misinterprets a constitutional provision, the 
frequent ¯repetition of the wrong will not create a right."  Amos v. Mosley, 
74 Fla. 555; 77 So. 619

"A long and uniform sanction by law revisers and lawmakers, of a legislative 
assertion and exercise of power, is entitled to a great weight in construing 
an ambiguous or doubtful provision, but is entitled to no weight if the 
statute in question is in conflict with the plain meaning of the 
constitutional provision." Kingsley v. Merril, 122 Wis. 185; 99 NW 1044

"Economic necessity cannot justify a disregard of cardinal constitutional 
guarantee."  Riley v. Carter, 165 Okal. 262; 25 P. 2d 666; 79 ALR 1018

"Disobedience or evasion of a constitutional mandate may not be tolerated, 
even though such disobedience may, at least temporarily, promote in some 
respects the best interests of the public."  Slote v. Board of Examiners, 274 
N.Y. 367; 9 NE 2d 12; 112 ALR 660.

"When any court violates the clean and unambiguous language of the 
Constitution, a fraud is perpetrated and no one is bound to obey it."  (See 
16 Ma. Jur. 2d 177, 178) State v. Sutton, 63 Minn. 147, 65 NW 262, 30 L.R.A. 
630 Am. St. 459.

"There can be no sanction or penalty imposed upon one because of his exercise 
of Constitutional rights." Sherar v. Cullen  481 F. 946

"Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no 
rule-making or legislation which would abrogate them." U.S. Supreme Court in 
Miranda v. Arizona 380 U.S. 436 (1966)

"The State cannot diminish RIGHTS of the people." Hurtado v. California  110 
U.S. 516

        You are entitled to privacy when dealing with police officers before 
they have given you constructive notice of your rights (the so called Miranda 
rights).  They can ask you questions (Florida v. Rodriguez, 469 US 1), 
examine your indentification (INS v. Delgado, 466 US 210), and ask to search 
your luggage (Florida v. Royer, 460 US 491), but you have the right to refuse 
to waive your rights by refusing to answer and not giving them consent.

Yes, folks, you can stand right there and read a police officer his rights. 
"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say CAN and WILL be used 
against YOU in a court of law..." If you understand what it means, you might 
want to say a court AT law, instead.

As you can see from the above, statutes are not law and have no force except 
in two cases:

1. You allow them to have power over you and waive your rights by not 
denouncing them on the spot. This is how unlawful laws can be legal.

2. They are provided for in the Constitution. This is the ONLY way they can 
always have any legal force whatsoever.

This is provided for in the Constitution...

9th Amendment: "The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall 
not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."

The Preamble to the Constitution says " among which are: life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness", it doesn't say those are the only ones.

"...all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the 
several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to support this 
Constitution...." from U. S. CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE VI, CLAUSE 3.

Note that it is not out of line for YOU to administer that oath upon the 
judicial officers present, so long as you don't include a test of religion 
(violate their 1st amendment rights). If they don't like it, too bad..as long 
as this is a court of record (there's a reporter there, right), when they go 
against the constitution, they just perjured themselves on the record.

What can you do about this? Prosecute the felony in a FEDERAL court. What 
law?

"Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, 
willfully subjects any inhabitant of any State, Territory, or District to the 
deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by 
the Constitution or laws of the United States, .... shall be fined not more 
than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; ...." from UNITED 
STATES CODE, TITLE 18, Section 242.

"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, 
or usage, of any State ...., subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen 
of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the 
deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the 
Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at 
law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. ...."  from 
UNITED STATES CODE, TITLE 42, Section 1983.

So you can sue the pigs? What about the judge?

"Every person who, having knowledge that any of the wrongs conspired to be 
done, and mentioned in section 1985 of this title, are about to be committed, 
and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the commission of the same, 
neglects or refuses so to do, if such wrongful act be committed, shall be 
liable to the party injured, or his legal representatives, for all damages 
caused by such wrongful act, which such person by reasonable diligence could 
have prevented; and such damages may be recovered in an action  on the case; 
and any number of persons guilty of such wrongful neglect or refusal may be 
joined as defendants in the action;...."  from UNITED STATES CODE, TITLE 42, 
Section 1986.

How much does it cost?

"... In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 
1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title....the court, in its discretion, may 
allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable 
attorney's fee as part of the costs."  from UNITED STATES CODE, TITLE 42, 
Section 1988.

They will claim they have immunity from prosecution, right?
Wrong. They already lost that.

"...an...officer who acts in violation of the Constitution ceases to 
represent the government."  from BROOKFIELD CO. V. STUART, (1964) 234 F. Supp 
94, 99 (U.S.D.C., Wash.D.C.)

"...an officer may be held liable in damages to any person injured in 
consequence of a breach of any of the duties connected with his office...The 
liability for nonfeasance, misfeasance, and for malfeasance in office is in 
his 'individual,' not his official capacity..." from 70 AmJur2nd Sec. 50, VII 
Civil Liability.

"Decency, security, and liberty alike demand that government officials be 
subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen.  In 
a Government of laws, existence of the government will be imperiled if it 
fails to observe the law scrupulously.  Crime is contagious. If government 
becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for the law..." OLMSTEAD V. U.S., 
277 US 348, 485; 48 S Ct. 564, 575; 72 LEd 944.

The so-called 'case law' discussed above, however, does have the force of law 
because the court in which you stand uses that as their law. So no matter 
what the dip shits in Congress do, unless the Courts agree to it, it has no 
power.

Another interesting example of Constitutional rights is fingerprinting. If 
you politely REFUSE to let them have fingerprints, then by taking your 
fingerprints against your will, the police have committed a crime. This is 
where case law really shines...Davis v.Mississippi, 394 U.S. 721: Fingerprint 
evidence is no exception to the rule that all evidence obtained by searches 
and seizures in violation of the constitution is inadmissible in a state 
court. Pp.723-724. - The Fourth Amendment applies to involuntary detention 
occurring at the investigatory stage as well as at the accusatory stage. Pp. 
726-727. - Detentions for the sole purpose of obtaining fingerprints are 
subject to the constraints of the Fourth amendment.. P.727. - "Nor can 
fingerprint detention be employed repeatedly to harass any individual, since 
the police need only one set of each person's prints." - "...the general 
requirement that the authorization of a judicial officer be obtained in 
advance of detention would seem not to admit of any exception in the 
fingerprinting context."

Interesting little tid-bit for Bible freaks: What is a lawyer?
The minute you have one you are in trouble.

In Luke 11:46, "WOE unto you lawyers."  What does Woe mean?  It says in 
Strong's concordance:  Upon you will come every pestilence, every disease, 
every hardship that can be imagined...

The emblem of the lawyers is the serpent. I wonder why...in the bible there 
is a larger serpent eating all the other serpents. The large serpent is 
administrative law and the small ones are lawyers and errant public servants 
(cops, bureaucrats, etc.) One of the emblems of the United States is an eagle 
with a serpent in it's claws. One of the early flags had a serpent 
intertwined among the stars...some of this stuff is fun.

This supposedly happened in Wisconsin.  The police stopped a car for 
speeding.   The car had 5 guys in it,  They all got out. The cop said: Who 
was driving the car?  They said they didn't know; he stopped the car.  So the 
cop wrote out 5 tickets.  When they went to Court, the cop relayed his story. 
So the Judge said to one of them.  "I'll give you immunity if you will tell 
me who was driving.  The guy said: I was.

If you feel entrapment coming when on the stand.... Turn to the judge and 
ask.  Is this a trick question?   He will say I can't give you council.  You 
now say:  I'm holding you now as my sureity that I don't get myself into a 
criminal jurisdiction. What is he going to do?  They will have to stricken 
the whole line of questioning from the record.

The Executive Branch of the U.S. Government is the only one who can license 
its own.  The Judicial is another branch of government. The power to license 
is the power to destroy so the Executive can never license the Judicial.  If 
they tell you that they are licensed say:  You better show me, because if you 
are, then we have sedition going on.

That Miranda warning is crazy .....  "You have the right to remain 
silent---etc."  Then what is the first thing they ask? "What's your name?" 
The idiot tells you you can remain silent, then he asks you for your name.  
If you don't tell them, they book you as John Doe.

HINKLEY was never convicted of an assassination attempt because he denied 
that he knew what it meant.  "I don't understand the charges of 
assassination." You can only be convicted of a crime when you tell them with 
your own mouth that you understand the charges -- until that time they 
couldn't nail Hinkley.  So what did they do with him?    Put him in the 
shrink house.

John told about a doctor that sued him for $1500.00 medical bill.  He went to 
him to negotiate.  Told Dr., You have to be making over 100k a year,  on 
$1500.00 your taxes will be $750 + ....I want to pay your bill, but I'll pay 
you in cash $500.00. Did he take it?  Like a fly on a pork chop.  NEGOTIATE 
THAT IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

How many of you have you have run into trouble trying to cash a check in a 
bank that you don't have an account in?  Ask them if they are a corresponding 
bank (FDIC)?  then ask; Are you telling me you are not going to cash one of 
your FDIC brothers bank checks?  Are you violating the terms of the covenant 
of the Federal Reserve Bank?  Are you denying  that this is a negotiable 
instrument on your brother bank?  Are you the branch manager of this bank?  
Are you violating the terms of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913?  Do you know 
the consequences there are for you violating these terms?  Aren't you a full 
service bank?   What does that mean?

If you think you are going to be held in Contempt of Court: First thing you 
need to give someone power of attorney at all times. Do it before any court.  
Have it signed by two witnesses. It allows some one to get in & out of Court 
any time, and IF IT INCLUDES THE STATEMENT: that you don't believe in lawyers 
because of there is a 1953-54 review of the American  Bar Association saying 
that if the attorney has been apprised that his client did commit any crime; 
he must turn that evidence in to the state authorities, and because you 
believe this is a violation of the contract right with the privileged 
licensed attorney, you now  want X Jones to be your council.

If they say: Answer the question or go to jail.  Say: If I answer can I go 
home?   Who is the injured party?

Never argue a fact.  Just hold to the law. What jurisdiction do you have over 
me? Who is the injured party? How can anything other than a person have an 
injury? Who is the Corporation?

We have the right to ask questions --so don't be afraid to ask. Don't get 
angry,  don't argue,   don't answer,    just ask questions--- Judge, why are 
you yelling? Judge, are you yelling because you can't produce an injured 
person?

There are two types of Notices in Court:  A Judicial Notice and a Private 
Notice.  To convene the Court, the Judge needs a Judicial Notice. The Judge 
cannot act on a private notice.

When the Judge asks for your name ---" Doesn't the injured party have to make 
the identification?" or "I am who I am." How many times did Jesus say who he 
was in the Bible. "I am who I am."

Do not allow hearsay evidence. There is a banker, representative of the 
county, state, federal government there? Objection. Hearsay evidence. Is the 
injured party present? No, then I demand that the case be dismissed.

Remember, if you are not having fun, you're not doing it right.

                          Storage Molotov Cocktail

 This a simple variation of a normal Molotov Cocktail that can be stored for 
any length of time.  Normal firebombs of this type leave the fuel or 
saturated wick exposed to the air, allowing the fuel to evaporate and 
eventually fill the storage space with noxious fumes, not to mention the mess 
occurring if the firebomb happens to be knocked over.  The materials you will 
need are as easy to acquire as those for a normal Molotov cocktail:

-a glass bottle with cap (the soda bottles with plastic caps work best).
-cloth or rag.
-a length of wire or string.
-fuel

 Twist the rag so that when it is doubled it will fit snugly into the mouth 
of bottle (it should not be able to move unless pulled or pushed on).  Tie 
the wire tightly around the middle of rag, then glue or otherwise attach the 
other end of the wire to the inside of the cap (keep it away from the threads 
unless you're really stupid and don't want the cap to close properly).  Fill 
the bottle with the fuel and stuff the rag and wire into the bottle, then 
screw on the cap.  Finally, wash off the fuel you split all over the bottle 
since you were in too much of a rush to find a funnel. 

 To use the firebomb unscrew the cap and pull on it to extract the desired 
length of wick and there's your Molotov cocktail.  If you don't know what to 
do from there, just take this device to your local police station and they 
will take care of you.

  GarBlEd UsEr Presents...
 An Interview With EFF.

     This is simply an interview I had with Mitchell Kapor of the EFF.  This 
interview was brought to you to show what us hackers, phreakers, etc. have 
going for us in the background.  And exactly how far they WILL go for us.  I 
hope you enjoy it, and even more importantly, send some $$ to the EFF.  A 
form will be placed at the bottom for this purpose.

>Who Began the EFF?

        Mitchell Kapor and John Perry Barlow

>What, in your opinion, Is the EFF about? 

        The Electronic Frontier Foundation is an organization concerned with 
the "Civilizing of cyberspace." By this we mean that our mission is to 
develop the burgeoning realm of computer based communications. We endeavor to 
develop and propagate tools and attitudes that make for easy and open access 
to computer networks. We also watch for especially unjust actions by 
governments and other organizations that deny common constitutional 
protections to users of computer systems. 


>How long has EFF been in existence?

        The EFF was founded in July of 1990.

>How large a current staff do you have?
>Whom is your current administrative/editorial staff composed of? 

Mitch Kapor, Executive director
Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel
Chris Davis, System Manager
Rita Rouvallis, Administrator (all full-time)

Gerard van der Leun, Director of Communications (part-time)
Helen Rose, Co-System Manager (volunteer)

>Do you see EFF as becoming a large and powerful voice in the legislative and 
>computer world? 

We want to have an impact on the legislative process, representing the
community of network users and presenting technically informed points of
view.

>What does EFF hope to accomplish in the next few years? 

The big issues for the next few years:

Develop detailed policies and procedures for computer investigation

Evolve digital services and regulations of the telephone network into open
platform for free speech and free enterprise

>What have you accomplished since you began? 


        In our first year The Electronic Frontier Foundation has: 

        Inspired and helped to organize and present the first Computer 
Freedom and Privacy Conference. CFP was a four day event that brought 
together, in search of knowledge and common ground, representatives from 
computer networking, law enforcement, and privacy advocate groups.

        Worked within Senator Leahy's Privacy Task Force in Washington,D.C. 
in order to advance the concerns of the computer networking community in the 
formation of legislation in this critical area. 

        Established a fully staffed, operational headquarters in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

        Distributed the first six issues of our electronic newsletter, 
EFFector Online, throughout the net.

        Published the first issue of our quarterly print newsletter, EFFECTOR. 

        Filed suit against the Secret Service for the unlawful search and 
seizure of computers, BBS systems, books and manuscripts at Steve Jackson 
Games in Austin, Texas.

        Defended Craig Neidorf, unjustly accused of publishing purloined
documents.

        Become a presence on the Internet with our node, eff.org. 

        Created an FTP archive on the net for documents on computer networking 
and privacy law.

        Spoken to numerous groups nationwide on the issues of civil liberties 
and computer networking.

        Made grants in aid to Computer Professionals for Social 
Responsibility as well as joining them in numerous projects and workshops 
around the nation. 

        Testified before the Federal Communications Committee concerning the
public access and design needs of the National Research and Education
network.

        Lobbied effectively at the state level to change legislation inimical 
to computer networking.

        Developed a network of relationships with the local and national 
media that has affected the climate of opinion about computer networking and 
begun to reverse the slide into "hacker hysteria" that was beginning to grip 
the nation.

        Given a net home at eff.org to groups like Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility and the new Computers and Academic Freedom group. 

        Created a voice that is listened to in Washington on issues 
concerning computer networking.

        Joined in an association with the ACLU and the Consumer Federation of 
America in order to plan and to act in the future to ensure broad public 
access to the information super-highways of the future. 

        Launched the Open Road program in order to make sure that the needs 
of the public in the building of the National Public Network are addressed at 
the beginning of the project.

        Begun research and development into creating the tools that will 
allow non-technical individuals using PCs to access the net over voice-grade 
telephone lines in a simple and straightforward fashion. 

        Defined the problems associated with the questions of protecting 
nodes and carriers from unwarranted risks and liabilities in providing 
information services from the producer to the consumer.


>What made you found the EFF?


EFF MISSION STATEMENT -- April, 1990

        A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic media 
which connect us. Computer-based communication media like electronic mail and 
computer conferencing are becoming the basis of new forms of community. These 
communities without a single, fixed geographical location comprise the first 
settlements on an electronic frontier. 

      While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give 
structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like newspapers, books, 
and telephones, the new digital media do not so easily fit into existing 
frameworks. Conflicts come about as the law struggles to define its 
application in a context where fundamental notions of speech, property, and 
place take profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the threat 
inherent in new computer and communications technologies, even as they 
struggle to master or simply cope with them in the workplace and the home.

        The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to civilize 
the electronic frontier; to make it useful and beneficial not just to a 
technical elite, but to everyone; and to do this in keeping with our 
society's highest traditions of the free and open flow of information and 
communication.

>Does EFF condone Hacking?

No.  Unauthorized entry into computer systems is wrong and should be
illegal.

>How do you see the future in regards to Anti-hacking regulations? 

We hope that law-makers and law enforcement will become more sophisticated
in their ability to differentiate different degrees and classes of illegal
activity, especially between casual exploration and more serious
intrusions.

>What, if any, will EFF's role in these be? 

Defending civil liberties of those using computers and networks.

>Do you see hackers as an invincible entity that will always be here, or as a
>"fad" that will eventually die out? 

There will always be explorers of new and forbidden territories.

>Do you feel that the Federal Bureau of Investigation should hire and use
>computer literate people for cases involving computers?

Yes.

>Why is it that you believe local police should not be involved in the serving
>of search warrants in hacker cases? 

They should be involved if they're properly trained and knowledgeable in
the conduct of computer-based searches.

>Do you think this will ever be achieved? 

Slowly, over time.

>How, and why did EFF become involved in the SJG case? 

We heard about it and read about it through reports over the Internet.  We 
then conducted our own investigation in which we determined that there had 
been serious overstepping of bounds by law-enforcement in the particular 
actions taken in that case.

>Has your opinion of hackers changed after the NeXt breakin at your 
>organization? 

Not really.  Being hacked into is always at least an annoyance. Fortunately, 
in our case there was no serious damage.  If there had been, we would have 
taken a more aggressive stance about going after the person responsible.

>Should the person who hacked your system be found, and brought to trial,
>and it became clear to you that he was mistreated by the SS and or FBI,
>would you help him in a case against the FBI or SS?

Conceivably.  But we only get involved in cases of where there are 
substantive Constitutional issues. We're not a hacker defense fund. 

>In your opinion, Why do people hack?

To learn, to explore, to thumb their nose at authority.  Many different 
reasons.  Despite the fact that some of the reasons themselves might be ok, 
they do not count as a justification for the action.

>your comments.

Cuprous Acetylide(Cu2C2): Brick red amorphous powder which explodes violently
when dry, on heating to about 120 deg C and also by friction.
(PATR 2700 (1960), Vol 1 page A72)

Cupric Acetylide(CuC2): Black amorphous precipitate, which explodes violently
on heating, impact or friction.
(ibid Vol 1 page A74)

CuC2 is very shock sensitive - even under water. It can form either as a
powder or a platelets.

Hard to do anything with - yes. It is too touchy - and that is even more
true for the CuC2 in platelet form. Just touching one of the platelets
can cause it to explode.

   As a member in The Society for Creative Anachronism (not to be confused 
with anarchy) I am exposed to weaponsmithing and armoring at all levels,  for 
the dime store anarchist and survivalist the one thing you have to know is 
how to improvise weapons quickly and with common items.

   This month I am going to be covering the axe where to find them and the
easiest way to produce them.

   I do not in any way shape or form recommend the common axes that can be 
purchased at local hardware stores or camping supply shoppes.  the problem is 
balance you will be more likely to kill your self rather then others.

   Ok the first and most important part of and axe is the handle if you have 
a shitty handle then your axe will not function well.  The best and only
material I RECOMMEND is wood, preferably a hard wood (oak or maple).
Honestly the ones available in stores are good you only need to make changes
to the balance that can be accomplished in one of 2 ways the first is to make 
the axe head lighter that is a waste of time you want a heavy head to be able 
to cut thru bone and cartilage so he only alternative is to weight the other 
end of the haft the best way is to use an external weight if you use an 
internal one you are weakening the overall strength of the weapon.  So now 
that I have established the reasons for the weight we need to find one ...
go down to your local hardware or plumbing supply store and buy a threaded
steel pipe end cap you want the weight to be about 1/3 the weight of the axe 
head you need to shave the end of the axe to accommodate the end cap.  now 
just screw it on the cap will thread the wood and form a strong joint.

   On to the head the problem with the store bought ones is the fact that 
they are to thick and don't have enough blade surface to go through someone
they will get stopped by their width.  You have a couple of choices for the
axe head the simplest is to find a piece of steel and cutting out the head 
and sharpening the blade.  The total surface of the blade using this method 
shouldn't be more then 18" from point to point more then this using steel
(sheet) will make it to weak and it will bend ...substitutes for sheet steel
can be found anywhere heads off of shovels,  car hoods(older models new ones 
are too thin) use your imagination here.

   Mounting the head is of prime importance if its not done correctly then 
you could lose your head at a most inopportune moment in your life and that 
wouldn't be good. For the style of axe we are discussing it must me mounted 
inside the axe handle that means that you must split the handle the hard 
woods are to brittle to do this easily in the form that you get them you need 
to sand off the lacquer on the the haft so it can absorb moisture get a pot 
of water boiling  you want to add about a pint of oil either linseed or a 
good wood finishing oil but linseed is best because it is absorbed easily by 
wood you need to make a cut in the center of the haft from the top down about 
13 inches.  Submerge the top of the haft in the water and oil let it boil for 
a good 2 to 4 hours depending on the type of wood. once this is done you need 
to mount the blade push the blade down to the bottom of the split you need at 
least 3 inches of the back of the blade to stick out of the rear of the 
handle to be able to anchor it properly.  Next get a vice and clamp the top 
of the haft and take some steel wire(you can substitute what ever you want 
but wire is the best) 14 gauge or smaller you need to wrap it as tightly as 
humanly possible ( this is the critical step if it is not tightly wound the 
axe is useless ) next take some leather strapping by it of cut up a leather 
jacket I don't care,  you need to wrap the head to the haft using x wraps 
this will help stabilize the head make sure that the leather is wet when you 
do this (when leather dries it shrinks) the leather will tighten down as it 
dries.  let the axe dry completely (may take up to 2 days)  after it dries 
take a good look at your wraps and make sure they are in good shape  oil the 
whole haft with linseed oil and wrap the hand grip in light leather and 
sharpen up the blade and you now have a real nice axe to use for many 
interesting purposes.  One thing I forgot to mention is the length of the 
handle it should be no more then the length of your leg from the thigh joint 
down. 

   That's basically it most of the information in this article is base on 
personal experience.  You can substitute whatever you want for items listed
but don't come crying to me if you lop off your leg.

                              THE NON BOX

     The non box..  Why do I call it this, you may ask.  Many Phreakers 
complain that all the good box colors are taken up by people that make stupid 
little hold buttons for their fonez.  This little toy runs right on the edge 
of box, and toy..  So I went with toy, and didn't use a good color.  Too bad 
though.. The burnt umber box woulda been cool.

     What does this box do?
   Simple question.. deserving a complex answer.  This box allows calls to be 
made from a line, while at the same time, halting any incoming calls.  Why 
would this be useful?  You could turn the box on at night.  You wouldn't be 
awoken by a ring in the night, and in an emergency, you could still call out! 
That's just soo cool.. right?  Wrong. This box has one, hidden feature.  If 
you have call waiting, and a modem.... you know what those call waitin' bluez 
are.. right?  Where you are in the middle of a 10 meg Kermit DL, and some 
idiot calls you and knocks you RIGHT OFF THE LINE.   Annoying.  Some people 
say, "Well just hit *70 and turn off the call waiting."  Not all area codes 
offer this feature! There is a way however...  Simply turn your non box on, 
make your call, and continue free of interruption!  NO PROBLEM!

     How does it work?
  This one is easy..  R1(the resistor) cuts a small amount of voltage out.. 
just enough to trick the ESS into believing the fone is off the hook.  
However, this is NOT enough to actually take the fone off the hook, 
therefore, you can still make calls.  It might be fun to play around with 
this, and see if you can make, or receive free calls with it too!  The person 
trying to call you will hear about half of a ring, and then he will hear a 
normal busy signal.

     How do I make a NON BOX?

SIMPLE!  Follow these instructions.

Go to radio-shack.. buy the following:

(1) DPDT Switch - Should have 6 leads and an on/off positions.
(1) Gold banded, 1000 Ohm resistor.
(1) Spool of Copper Wiring.  Any color.. have fun here.

Now simply construct the shown design.  NOT a problem!

I am no ascii artist.. If you have the EXE version of this Mag, read that for 
a better picture.

                         RING          TIP

R1 is the resistor.  The numbers correspond to the poles on the switch.  The 
bottom of the switch (5,6 in the diagram) is the ON position. The two wires 
marked with the ^ signs must each be 3 inches long, and lead to NOTHING.  
They must not connect, but they have to be there!  REMEMBER THAT!  Simply 
tape them to the side of your casing,(plastic, not metal for your geniuses 
out there!) or as in my case, tape them to the wall.
Remember, RED RIGHT RING.  GREEN LEFT TIP.

ok now..  You want to connect it..  SIMPLE!
GO to the wall jack.. loosen the screws attaching the red and green wires.  
DO NOT REMOVE THESE WIRES!  Attach the ring and tip to their respective 
screws, and re-tighten.  The box will not function if the two original 
wires(into the jack) were removed.

Now, to operate the box, simply Click the box to the on position.  Go to a 
friend's house, or a pay fone, and test it out by calling your house.  NO 
Problem!  It should work like a charm.

Have fun with your box.. and report any discoveries on it's actions to me.

Rocket Center of Pressure Calculation

  Center of pressure (CP) calculation is perhaps the most important aspect of 
building (model) rockets, yet it is often overlooked because of the abundance 
of prefabricated models available.  If you want to construct your own rocket 
you will need this information in order to determine the stability of your 
rocket. 

  The definition of CP is the point at which all the forces acting on the 
rocket are evenly distributed around.  Three types of stability originate 
from the location of the center of gravity (CG) in relation to the CP: 

-negative stability:  CG is located behind the CP.  The rocket essentially 
wants to move in opposition to the source of trust, causing  it to revolve 
around it's CG, which leads to a nice display of rocket acrobatics just over 
the launch site.  Let someone you don't like launch these. 

-neutral stability:  CG is located at the CP.  This is similar to negative 
stability as the rocket will fly around in changing direction. A certain 
phenomenon occurs when as the motor burns in a rocket with neutral stability, 
the CG moves towards the nose, which causes the rocket to have positive 
stability (see below) and suddenly shoot off in any direction, including the 
launcher or anyone else in the vicinity for that matter.  Take some of these 
to the local rocket show if you have sadistic tendencies. 

-positive stability:  CG is located in front of the CP.  This is what causes 
rockets to fly straight, although weather cocking (moving with the air 
currents) is a result. 

note:  The ideal position for the CP is one caliber (length of the diameter 
of the body tube) behind the CG.  This gives the rocket positive stability, 
and reduces WEATHER COCKING to a minimum. 

  Once you have your rocket or plans for the rocket, you can use the 
following calculations to determine the CP and adjust your CG (with motor) 
accordingly.  These calculations are a simplified version of the Barrowman 
method, a method for finding the CP of any rocket, which should be looked up 
if your rocket does not fit the basic design in this version.

  Why do elephants have feet?

     Have you ever lain awake at night wondering why elephants have feet?

Of COURSE you have!  Why everyone has pondered this eternal question!  Some 
may feel that it is to propagate the species.  Others state that it helps 
keep them from running into trees.

Wait a moment!  Elephants EAT trees...  Does this mean they take in lies?

Oh dear.. I just realized that the majority of you are unfamiliar with the 
Tree Hypothesis.  This simply will not do!

     The Tree HYPOTHESIS:

All Plant life of any type lies.  This is a inherent nature to the life form.  
Some however, lie more than others.
  The tree, for example, is the ultimate liar.  Anything a tree may say, will 
be the DIRECT opposite of the truth.  The shrub however only twists the 
truth, while grass just tells little white lies.

Examples:
Man: "Hey tree, What color is the sky?"
Tree: "Why it is Orange of course!"

Man: "Hey Shrub, what color is the grass?"
Shrub: "Why, it's PINK!"

Man: "Hey grass, what color is asphalt?"
Grass: "Grey!"

As you can see, orange is the direct opposite of blue. Thus the tree!  But 
pink is completely, yet not directly opposite of green.  While grey is just a 
tad off from black.

Proof of the Tree theory:
1)  Many people get lost in a forest.  Why is this? Have you ever asked a 
tree for directions?

2) Have you ever heard a tree tell the truth?

3)  Did you hear about those unfortunate loggers that were put out of 
business to save the one-eyed hooting owl?  Guess what, the government 
consulted the forest on this one.  There really is no such thing as a one 
eyed hooting owl!

4) Have you ever written an answer on a test that you KNOW is correct, but 
when you get it back, there is a different answer staring at your face... 
marked WRONG!  Your test was printed on PAPER!  hmmmm...

5) Have you ever bought a #2 pencil?  How do they know it was really the 
second one made?  Why does your friend have his OWN #2 pencil!

6) The Trojan Rock-Iron 2000lb. Test rubber always seems to BREAK!  Rubber 
is made from TREES!

7) In court, they put their hand on a bible, a PAPER bible, and swear to tell 
the truth.  Yet they never seem to!

8)  They call styrofoam disposable plates PAPER plates..  This one just 
confuses the hell out of me, so I thought I would throw it in for good marks.

9) Have you ever looked through a dictionary, where it says, see blah, when 
you look up blah, it points you right back to the original word!

10) Have you ever tried to tell north from the moss on a tree?  Why do you 
think this issue was so late?


But wait..  You may be reading this on paper.. are you reading a lie?

Now back to your regularly scheduled text file....

The elephant, after digesting many a lie, has turned into a huge, evil 
creature, with upturned fangs, and a gaping maw.  The deadly elephant uses his 
tremendous feet to crush the feeble grass he once fed upon.  Even the deadly 
earthworm is no match for this ravenous beast.  Suddenly, the deadly flying 
aardvark dives down from a tree.  Tired of measly ants, this vicious beast 
feeds upon the dangerous elephant, only to further it's wrath.  Swooping 
down, it's sticky tounge grasps the elephant's trunk, pulling the beast 
skyward.  As it lets go, the elephant drops below, smashing a nearby urban 
development.  Hundreds of aardvarks swarm in from above, as the elephant 
splatters across a 5 mile area.  The ducks walk in circles, waiting for their 
chance at the carrion left behind.  For the aardvarks only eat the bones, 
leaving behind a fleshy mess of, blubber, meat and partially digested leaves.  
This is the meal for the ducks, as the aardvarks attack a NATO tank passing 
by.

  Until next time, I'm Marty Stoufer, and this is our..
 Wacked America.

Oops! Damn.. wrong editor.. sorry about that..
Anyways elephant have feet to support their legs.  Sheesh, some people.

                          PATHOGEN PROGRAMMING
                                   or
                         The Infector's Handbook

Part ONE of Many!

     Welcome to Garbled User's Handy Dandy Guide to Virii Programming.  In 
This, and upcoming issues, we will be giving you a complete tutorial on the 
theory, operation, and writing of our little EXE friends.  We will even 
include pieces of code here, so you can write your own!

PART I

     This Month's Column is on the theory of operation of many virii.  This 
will explain the many different types of Virii, from a programmer's point of 
view.

     SECTION I: The Trojan Horse.

              Named after the famous wooden horse of Homer's Iliad which was 
presented as a gift to the trojans, while actually holding an invasionary 
force.  This program is a deadly data destroyer.  It is virtually 
undetectable by most scanners, and destroys data instantly.  It is named 
after the horse, because it uses the same principal of operation.  A guilded 
exterior which promises to be a fun game, or powerful utility, turns out to 
be a nasty program that will format your hard drive.  This program is very 
simple to create.  A nice loading screen that tells you It is loading the 
program, while the devious little bug is turning your HD into mulch. Most of 
these can be ended with a nasty little remark that ¯infinitely pisses off the 
foolish user.  An example of this program would be the AIDS2 "virus". though 
it is not a virus at all.  Simply go to your nearest PD BBS, and download 
some source code for a HD formatting utility.  Then guild it up, make it 
really attractive.  A nice touch is to add extensive documentation.  This 
will lead the user to believe it is a real program.  Make it something that 
the user would really want.  Don't go overboard however.  Saying that a 
program will speed your computer up to 400 MIPS is going overboard.  Use 
something logical, like a VGA Font creation tool, or a memory manager.  You 
can nail quite a few people with this one!

     SECTION II: The ANSI Bomb.

              This is a particularly nasty version of the trojan horse.  This 
program however requires NO knowledge of programming whatsoever!  This 
program can be hidden in documentation.  You could take a program, add your 
little segment to the beginning of a document, and the fool would never be 
the wiser. There is almost NO protection against this Trojan.  The only 
protection is people without ANSI.SYS loaded, or people who are running a 
special anti-bomb version of ANSI.SYS.  Luckily, many people do not like this 
version of ANSI.SYS because it severely limits the functioning of your ANSI.  
The program changes the definition of a key, so that when pressed, it loads a 
Macro of sorts, that can be VERY NASTY.  Such as when you hit F1, it types 
out FORMAT C: and instantly hits enter.  Some particularly nasty versions 
switch the definition of the Y and N keys, so that a person wishing to say no 
to those "ARE YOU SURE (YN)" questions will get NAILED.  For example, I could 
have nailed you right now with one, and you wouldn't have been the wiser, 
until it hit you.  But I didn't.  Why?  Simple, why would I wish to infect my 
own readers?  That would completely ruin my credibility, and kill my 
newsletter instantly!

     SECTION III: The Worm.

              Many people foolishly mistake this program for a virus.  This 
is no virus.  A worm is a program that Loads itself into memory, and on top 
of your command.com file.  The program slowly "eats" away portions of your 
hard drive, one byte at a time.  This program is quite possibly the most 
difficult of any virus to write, and therefore, we intend to save it for 
last.

     SECTION IV: The Virus.

              The virus is a VERY evil little program that loads itself onto 
your COMMAND.COM or IBMBIOS.COM and waits.  The program can do one of many 
things.  First, It could Wait for a certain date, and wipe out your HD.  Or 
It could Start to copy itself all over hell, and cover your disk with itself.  
Some are just harmless little programs that cause little annoyances, like 
messages that say "HEY, that hurts, Don't Hit the keys so hard."  The virus 
is distinguished from the Worm by it's ability to infect other computers.  
Should a floppy be put into your drive, that disk will become infected, and 
the virus can infect other computers.  The virus can manifest itself in any 
program.  Meaning a program that was virus free yesterday, could be totally 
infected today.  The virus is virtually undetectable to your computer.  Most 
virus scanners, which claim protection against Virii, do nothing more than 
search for known virii.  This can be easily overcome by writing your own.

              There are many, many sub-divisions of each class of pathogens.  
These will be completely detailed and explained in later Sections of this 
continuing file.  This is nothing more than an opening summary, to prepare 
you for the knowledge you are to receive.  Soon, you will be introduced to 
source, and valuable tips that will aid you in the creation of your own 
pathogens.  After we have summarized, and completely detailed each type or 
form of pathogen, we will begin publishing source codes for virii, that you 
can edit to your own purposes, or use in your own virii.

COMING SOON: PART II : The ANSI bomb. A complete detailing of The ANSI command 
set, and how to use it to your own purposes.

PART III: Advanced ANSI Bombing.  Now that you're an expert.. Here's some 
things to REALLY knock their socks off with!

                          PATHOGEN PROGRAMMING

   PART II of MANY

Welcome to Pathogen Programming Part II.  This section is completely devoted 
to the creation, use and theory of operation of ANSI bombs.  This is a 
simple, yet effective way to produce mass chaos and disruption in a network, 
or computer.

SECTION I : The ANSI bomb.

     Simply, an ANSI bomb, is a program written in ANSI command codes, that 
will redefine the keyboard to make it do what you want it to.  To the 
distress of the user.

SECTION II : How to build an ANSI bomb.

     This is simple.  First pull out an ANSI drawing program.  Use this to 
make a nice ansi picture for your victim to view.  Then use a text editor to 
add the nasty bit.  Code with explanations follow.

^[ = The ESC character. This is the main point of all ANSI.  All ANSI 
statements begin with this.  usually followed by a "["

^[[a;b;c;"x";dp   a and b : escape code for the key you wish to redefine.
                  c : a character before x. Such as a <CR>
                  x : the command you wish this key to perform.
                  d : The end to your statement. such as ENTER.

This is the entire thing, for an ansi bomb.  now here is an example.

^[[0;59;13;"format c:";13;"y";13p

Now for an explanation of what this does.

0;59 : this is the ansi code for the F1 key.  You are telling the driver to 
re-define this key.

;13  : this is the ansi code for the ENTER key.  This is sent to the monitor, 
and is part of the redefinition.

;"format c:" : this is another part of the definition.  THis is sent to the 
monitor too.

etc..

p  :  This is the code, that tells ANSI.SYS that you are ¯performing a key 
redefinition.  It HAS to be at the end of your statement!

Now.. when your poor victim hits F1, here's what he sees.

C>di{F1}
C>format C:
WARNING, THIS WILL DESTROY ALL DATA ON THE FIXED DRIVE C: ARE YOU SURE YOU WISH 
TO DO THIS? Y
formatting sector 1  track 3


The Y is already typed, and entered for him.. he has no choice.

To enter a special character, or letter, simply type the DEC value of that 
character. For example.  To perform a carriage return, use the number 13.

Entire paragraphs of commands can all be put into one ANSI statement.. 
essentially wroughting complete chaos upon the user.  Such as deleting all 
the files, and formatting every drive they have!

F1  : 0;59
F2  : 0;60
F3  : 0;61
     This little chart shows what the ANSI definitions for these keys are.  
They are quite simply, Keyboard codes, used to write programs to read these 
special keys..  The Fx list goes on and on.. all the way up to ALT F10, which 
is 0;113.  The order is.. Normal, Shift, control, then alt.  So SHIFT F1 is 
0;84, while Control F1 is 0;94.
See the pattern?

Now.. You can put this whole thing together into one huge file.. capable of 
mass destruction.  Using a keyboard function list, you will be able to 
redefine ANY key to do your evil deed.  Such as making the ENTER key a format 
C: command.  How?  use 13 as your definition.  The 0 is used to put in 
EXTENDED keyboard commands.. such as F1 and PGUP.  So any key on the keyboard 
can be redefined with the use of an ASCII conversion table.

Good luck, and happy crashing!

   This is the first release of a series of articles I am doing for F.B.I..  
I feel that although F.B.I. is based on hacking and phreaking of a more extra 
legal nature there is a need for information that will produce a more 
tangible result I mean the gratification of seeing someone get blown up into 
a thousand little bits is an extremely self satisfying act especially if the 
person is a real pain in the ass. There is more to life then making 
explosives and weapons although they are quite fun.  So I am here to show you 
how to get ahead in life by whatever means possible. 

   The simplest way to get ahead in life is to get an education because lets 
face it without a college education in todays economy you are subjecting 
yourself to 2 career paths either that of a dishwasher for Denny's or and axe 
murderer.  So let me show you a way for you to get the gift of a college 
education for no money down. 

   O.K. to start with whenever you enroll in college you are given a number 
of financial aid forms including a F.A.F. (which is the Federal form) to fill 
out. These forms are your ticket they only require some forethought on the 
part of the student.  The section that is of critical concern is the 
independent status area that is where it is determined if you are a dependent 
of your parents ,guardian or court system there are 3 ways to be declared 
independent that is to be 1. over the age of 24,  2. be able to prove that 
you are independent of your parents support for the previous 2 years.  3. 
prove that your parents have been deceased for more then a year.  Since 
changing birth and death records are a real bitch lets tackle the second 
choice and that is establishing the fact that you have been free of parental 
support for the last 2 years.

   First step is to establish a residence separate from your parents this is 
the simplest of the 3 steps all you have to do is go down to the department 
of motor vehicles and change the address on your drivers licence or other 
I.D. to an address where you can pick up your mail this address can be anyone 
including relatives as long as they do not have the same last name as yours 
all you have to say is that you are renting a room from them (if they ask 
which they don't) you can still live with your parents all you need is the 
i.d. with the other address.  That is the first step and the easiest. 

   The second and probably the hardest is getting your parents to not claim 
you on their income tax returns for 2 years.  If they don't want to do this 
even after you point out that they will save over 10,000.00 per year for 
college as opposed to the 2,400.00 deductions that they will get for the next 
2 years. You can always do what I did and that is lie and say that they 
didn't all you have to do is produced the income tax returns for those years 
which is very easy to forge.  All you need are tax forms and, you can get 
those by either writing to the I.R.S. and they will send them to you no 
questions asked or you can get a copy of a tax program and print your own 
out.  Either having your parents not claim you or adjusting the tax forms are 
untraceable the federal financial aid dept has neither the time nor the 
resources to track them down.

   The third and simplest is you need to have an income.  Try not to make it 
over 5,000.00 a year if possible because at 5k or less you qualify for a full 
Pell grant (5,000.00+ per year) which is non repayable. You just need to show 
them that you had a legit job cuz you can't support yourself on 0 income.

   If these 3 steps are followed you insure yourself a full pell grant as 
well as the ability to apply to the E.O.P. prog. (which is based on minority 
status and socioeconomic standpoint).  You are also eligible for full Perkins 
loans (unfortunately you have to pay these back).

   I have intentionally left out state financial aid forms simply because 
they are different from state to state but the above information does apply 
to the following state forms.  New York and Florida as for the other 48 
states I can't say but it is a general rule the state forms are more relaxed 
in their requirements.

This concludes the first of hopefully many articles on how to get ahead for 
no money down.

If anyone has any information on state requirements please send them via 
Telnet if you can't get it there then Call

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/| EDITOR'S  OPINION. |\/\/| BY GaRblEd uSeR |\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     This issue's editorial is on Viruses.  This was inspired by our nation's 
little virus scare as of late.  Yes, once again, the nations press has blown 
something so out of proportion.. that it's almost sickening.  The dreaded 
Michealangelo Virus was nothing more than a infectious FAT attacker.  Oh no! 
Any moron with Norton Unformat or PC tools Mirror can fix this pathetic 
problem. I've even heard that some DATA CONSULTANTS have been charging up to 
$75 PER MEG to recover lost data!

     Lost data my butt.  The data was ALL there, they just couldn't find it.  
Even better was the media's warning to the public to "shut of your computer 
to prevent data loss"  Oh.. that's a good one..  Sorry public unaware, but 
the neet little virus strikes ANYTIME on or AFTER the date set.  Oops.  Love 
that media.

     This virus was just a mere ¯infectious trojan.  We here at FBI think this 
is hilarious, how the entire media explodes over some stupid little toy!  
Mind you, I do not wish to insult the author of this program, I merely wish 
to show how the media overinflated it to a huge data killer war hammer from 
hell!

     We also feel that we are sick of this.  Starting this month, the FBI 
plans to introduce the world to REAL virii!  We intend to show the media that 
a mere FAT disruptor is nothing to be afraid of.  And for you, our loyal 
readers we intend to teach you the finer arts of datacrime!  When one cannot 
steal, one must destroy!

     Many will soon learn what a real virii looks like.  And our easy 
tutorials will show you how to make your own!


  FBI is ALLWAYS looking for more authors!! And more ways to become a better 
publication!!  There are many things YOU can do, as a user.. to help us here at FBI.

 A) Send us your articles!! They can be on anyhting.. As you have seen, FBI 
supports Phreaking, hacking, and anarchy. We are also willing to support just 
about anything you send in! Send us in a carding file, we'll print it up!! The 
only reason this issue was mainly ANARCHY was the fact that I (GarBled UsEr) 
specialize in anarchy.. and I wrote most of these articles!!

 B) Say what!? You don't like the way we run FBI?!? Or even better.. you LOVE 
FBI and wish to shower us with praise and admiration!! Well.. for either of 
these.. get in contact with us!! You can allways MAIL us over the internet at 
the following adresses!!


                                GArBlEd UsEr

                                315-488-1005

We would be glad,and honored, to hear from you.. Whether it is praise, 
criticizm, or just plain hate mail.. We'd be glad to get it.. We want to 
improve the group in any way possible!! This can only be done with YOUR help!

Also.. If you have an article for us.. MAIL it to us at these addresses!! We'll 
be SURE to get it.. and will be damn proud to put it in.


     Unfortunately.. we have a few rules concerning articles submitted to us.

1) No disclaimer is nessecary, as a general disclaimer will be put at the end 
of each newsletter! Putting a disclaimer in will just cause unneeded hassle for our poor editors.

2) In anarchy and Chemistry articles, all measurements must be in the following units.. or your article may not be accepted!
Temperature - CELCIUS!!
Distance    - Meter(metric)
Volume      - Liter(metric)
Mass        - Gram(Metric)
Please help us keep a standard in our newsletters by conforming to these 
standards.. If you wrote the file in english system originaly, please take the 
time to convert..

3) Please submit only original articles, written by yourself(or copied from a 
book by you). Please do not submit articles that you also submitted to 12 
different newsletters.  If you send it to us, and follow these guidelines, it 
WILL be accepted.

4) Try to keep all Headers and credits to about 5 lines at the beginning and 
the end of the files.. This will keep our little publication neat for any of 
you readers.


     Also.. If you would like a subscription to our publication.. Simply send 
us a message saying so. We are non profit, and therefore we will mail a printed copy of the newsletter out(prior to national release, so YOU are one of the 
first to get the issue!) postage due. This may sound like we are cheap, but 
this way nobody gets cheated, and we get to remain anonymous.  Also.. we need 
your address to send you mail.. :)

NOTE- Our internet accounts do not allow for the sending of mail outside of our system.. therefore it will be impossible to respond to your messages. So don't 
go around thinking we hate you because we never responded.. 


  F B I   Thanks you for your support.. and we hope to bring you more quality 
literature in the future.
