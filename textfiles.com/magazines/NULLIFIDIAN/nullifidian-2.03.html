belief.  [f. med. L _nullifidius_ f. L _nullus_ none +

The purpose of this magazine is to provide a source of
articles dealing with many aspects of humanism.

We are ATHEISTIC as we do not believe in the actual
existence of any supernatural beings or any transcendental
reality.

We are SECULAR because the evidence of history and the daily
horrors in the news show the pernicious and destructive
consequences of allowing religions to be involved with
politics and nationalism.

We are HUMANISTS and we focus on what is good for humanity,
in the real world.  We will not be put off with offers of
pie in the sky, bye and bye.

>From a Quebec government pamphlet entitled "Full and equal
rights whatever your religion":

Under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, every
person is entitled to be treated equally, without
discrimination or harassment.

The Charter was adopted in 1975.  Created under this
fundamental law, the Commission des droits de la personne
must:

o    promote an understanding of the Charter;

o    see that situations jeopardizing human rights and       
     freedoms are corrected.

The Charter forbids discrimination...

"Every person has a right to full and equal recognition and
exercise of his human rights and freedoms, without
distinction, exclusion or preference based on race, colour,
sex pregnancy, sexual orientation, civil status, age except
as provided by law, religion, political convictions,
language, ethnic or national origin, social condition, a
handicap or the use af any means to palliate a handicap.

Discrimination exists where such a distinction, exclusion or
preference has the effect of nullifying or impairing such
right."  [Section 10]

..and harassment

"No one may harass a person on the basis of any ground
mentioned in section 10."  [Section 10.1]

DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RELIGION...

This means..

that you are prevented from exercising a freedom or a right
recognized in the Charter because of your religion or
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO RELIGION [emphasis added] or because you
do not practice a religion.
************************************************************

Just note that this was adopted, non-controversially, in
1975, and has been Quebec law since.  No fundies marching in
the street, no bishops denouncing it, no real controversy at
all.  I don't think they even bother to picket the abortion
clinics here.

I particularly liked the phrasing of the explanatory
paragraph, which includes religion, absence of religion, or
having a religion and refusing to practice it.  Feel free to
recommend it to your local legislature as a law which has
been in existence for 20 years, without bringing on the
collapse of civilization into moral chaos.

      A BUDDHIST CRITIQUE OF THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD
            Gunapala Dharmasiri; Golden Leaves, 1988

Early Buddhism incorporated a rejection of Hindu concepts of
theism, with arguments similar in many cases to the Western
philosophical atheism responding to Christianity.  This book
is a modern exposition of the Buddhist critique of classical
Theism, relying extensively on the Western philosophical
vocabulary, indeed almost the full range of atheistical
arguments, and correlating this with the Pali canon.  As a
thorough attack on the God concept, it is comparable to 
excellent reference works such as Michael Martin's "Atheism:
a Philosophical Justification," 1990, or J.L. Mackie's "The
Miracle of Theism," 1982.

However, the interest of such a book for humanists is beyond
its uncompromising atheist nature.  Saying: "The Buddha did
not accept the existence of God.  He also rejected the idea
of a soul though he advocated the possibility of salvation,"
Dharmasiri defends an explicitly religious atheism.  Indeed,
his few passing references to humanism are decidedly
negative.  Among the factual claims made that most humanists
would be skeptical of are the reality of reincarnation--
which sets the stage for salvation as extinction; and
psychic powers---which provide a means to apprehend the
reality of continual rebirth.  But these differences are not
all.  Even with the remarkable similarity in the arguments
rejecting the God concept, early Buddhism ends up with a
significant difference in attitude compared to typical
humanist approaches, which has ethical implications as well.

Humanism claims to move beyond bare atheism in providing a
outlook of life; though its success in this is dubious at
best.  A denial of theistic claims and attitudes constrains
a philosophy of life but a little, and continually
criticizing theism is but reactive.  The early Buddhist
views' different form of atheism is valuable in reminding
humanists of this.  It also helps us see, universalistic
ambitions aside, how historically contingent our
ethical-political philosophies are.  Buddhism is revealed as
bearing the stamp of its birth in a Hindu religious context;
Western humanisms are similarly unintelligible without a
history of Christianity.

In short, I highly recommend this book for what it
indirectly prompts humanists to think of, besides its
determined and usually accurate criticism of the very
fundamentals of Christianity.

A series of quotes from Lemuel K. Washburn's _Is the Bible
Worth Reading?_ originally published 1911, by Truth Seeker,
made available to all electrontically by the Bank of Wisdom
Box 926, Louisville, KY 40201

The book is everywhere interspersed with these delightful
quotes.  This article consists solely of those quotes.  By
the way, the answer to the book's question is "no".

     The cross everywhere is a dagger in the heart of
liberty.


     A miracle is not an explanation of what we cannot
comprehend.


     The statue of liberty that will endure on this
continent is not the one made of granite or bronze, but the
one made of love of freedom.


     Take away every achievement of the world and leave man
freedom, and the earth would again bloom with every glory of
attainment; but take away liberty and everything useful and
beautiful would vanish.

     A dogma will thrive in soil where the truth could not
get root.


     The measure of liberty which man enjoys determines the
civilization of the age in which he lives.


     The person who can make a loaf of bread is more to the
world than the person who could perform a miracle.

     The feet of progress have always been shod by doubt.


     A true man will not join anything that in any way
abridges his freedom or robs him of his rights.

     The man who accepts the faith of Calvin is miserable in
proportion to the extent he carries it out.

     Whatever tends to prolong the existence of ignorance or
to prevent the recognition of knowledge is dangerous to the
well-being of the human race.


     A higher respect for man has been one of the chief
promoters of civilization. Advancement has always been
toward right and truth when the ranks were imbued with a
proper regard for human hearts and human happiness.


                      FREETHOUGHT COMMANDS

     Say nothing about others that you would not have others
say about you.

     Be severe toward yourself; be kind to your fellow-man.

     Do not give advice that you cannot follow.

     Do not thank God for what man does.

     Serve neither God nor Mammon, but humanity alone.

     Do not try to be perfect as a "Father in heaven," but
try to be better than you yourself are.

     Seek first to improve the earth, and heaven will be of
less consequence,


     Let us not forget that men speak according to the
measure of their knowledge and light, and that a superior
enlightenment is a higher authority.

     History shows that there is nothing so easy to enslave
and nothing so hard to emancipate as ignorance, hence it
becomes the double enemy of civilization. By its servility
it is the prey of tyranny, and by its credulity it is the
foe of enlightenment.


     There is greater argument in one fact than in all the
creeds.


     It is easier to believe that a man is honest who says
the Bible is the word of God than to believe that he is
bright.

     The Bible upon which Christianity is founded does not
say what Christianity is, what a Christian is, nor what we
must do in order to be a Christian.

     There is no justifiable Christianity in this age.


     A dogma is the hand of the dead on the throat of the
living.


     The progress of the world depends upon freedom of
thought and freedom of utterance.


     If you can forgive the man who wronged you, the
neighbor who slandered you and help the poor about you, you
need not be particular about making any professions of
righteousness

     If man had no knowledge except what he has got out of
the Bible he would not know enough to make a shoe.


     The great work of man has ever been to rescue the
present from the past; to turn the mind from what it has
left behind to the opportunities and duties which are around
it. For this has genius toiled down the ages, sung its song
of love, carved its dream of beauty and whispered to the
world's dull ear its bright message of hope.

     A true man is not troubled by anything but his own
acts.


     The true man walks the earth as the stars walk the
heavens, grandly obedient to those laws which are implanted
in his nature.


     A great many people are afraid of knowledge, but we
have seen hundreds of people that we thought would be
improved if they knew more, but we have never seen one that
we thought would be better if he knew less.

     You cannot stuff your minds with the lives of saints
and grow good on the stuffing.


     Some persons are remembered solely for their virtues
and others solely for their faults. This is why we have a
Jesus and a Judas.

     When men are hungry roast mutton is better than the
lamb that taketh away wrath.

                          ****     ****

     If a man can look in the mirror of his own soul without
shame, he can look the whole world in the face without a
blush.

     Civilization has come about by going to school more
than to church.


     Nature is the volume from which all of our knowledge
has been translated.

     Every fact is backed up by the whole universe.


     Christianity is a black spot on the page of
civilization.


     The church is a bank that is continually receiving
deposits but never pays a dividend.

     When a minister says that God will help you, ask him to
put up the collateral.

When someone takes on the world without flinching, and gets 
interviews with William T. Vollman (author of THE RAINBOW 
DIARIES), Randall Phillip (editor of FUCK), and even talked to 
Dennis Cooper in the last issue, you know you're dealing with 
somebody who isn't afraid to take on the crazies.  This is what 
fanzines dream of being--independent, xeroxed, DIY--but almost 
never achieve because there isn't the intelligence and gall in 
most people to pull this thing off right.  This is the stuff, the 
place, the thing you got to see, like talking to somebody you 
really want to know.--o

Representing the opposite end of the overt-passion scale is C.L. 
Champion's "poema cocci," which consists of four scattered 
rectangles.  In the middle of one is the word "cloud"; in another 
is a "c"; and "clod" is in a third.  The fourth is empty.  Earth,

90853.  68 pp., $5.00.  This enticing zine has included so many 
well-known micropress poets I can't mention them all.  Suffice it 
to say that this publication is an exploration of the spirit of 
poetry in the '90s, represented in almost 40 poems, plus b&w 
collages, two-tone photographs, reviews and even three comix 
sketches.  Amid the clarity of well-worked verse and reliable 
voices is a sense of mission; to present tasteful but not tame 
poetry; to create something enjoyable and lasting.  For example, 
Todd Kalineki attempts to paint, "& made a few random attempts at 
the abstract./ Fuck this, i thought--/ nature's more powerful..."  
Todd Moore interacts with his father: "he grabbed/ my hand &/ 
made me/ touch the/ pulse going/ up & down/ on his wrist..." 
vivid images abound.  Elsewhere, Cheryl Townsend contemplates

I'm still interesting in possibly getting some equipment off

Still got any goodies ?


Thanks.

I am trying to assist Dr. Michael Solliday at SIUC in reaching
Jan McCoy.  Dr. Solliday was given the address:

  JMMCOY AT SPR5.ISBE.STATE.IL.US

When I send my note, I receive a message back indicating that the
mail was delivered.  A short time later I receive a response from SMTP
stating that the host was unknown.  Can you provide any assistance in
reaching Ms. McCoy?

Thanks.

good to hear from you Paul.  Ed and I recently talked about possibilities 
for you.  And of course you know Ed would love to have you guys around.

Anyhow, I'm a bit nuts at the moment.  My wife just had a baby and we're 
getting used to our new life.

But we will be looking for a person or two and you just might fit the 
bill.  Not sure at the moment and I only glanced quickly at your 
background. Give me a few days and I'll be in touch.

I need to write some scripts for processing forms and maps on our www
server.  I've been sorting through references to Perl on the net.  It looks
like scripts need to be stored in the cgi-bin directory.  Do I have access
priviliges to put new scripts there?  And how do I reference that location
from an html document on our server?

Specifically, what would help a lot is:
1.)
 a sample script for a clickable map (with comments on how it works), where
I can fill in new coordinates and links.  And then a sample html document
that will go in our ncrel server that shows how to call it.  I know how to
do the html stuff, I just don't know the path to the script.
2.)
A sample of a forms processing script that will save comments to a text
file on the ncrel server (survey.txt).  Again, I know how to code forms in
html, I just don't know path to script for processing.

If I could get some help on these two items it would be greatly
appreciated.  Then I could set up some training on a more leisu
