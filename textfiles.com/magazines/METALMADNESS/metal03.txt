LYRICS TO MASTER OF PUPPETS <_METALLICA_>

Battery:
<Hetfield, Ulrich>
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

        Smashing through the boundaries
        Lunacy has found me
        Cannot stop the battery
        Pounding out aggresion
        Turns into obsession
        Cannot kill the battery

        Cannot kill the family
        Battery is found in me

        Battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungary voilence seekers, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

        Smashing through the boundaries
        Lunacy has found me
        Cannot stop the battery
        Pounding out aggresion
        Turns into obsession
        Cannot kill the battery

        Cannot kill the family
        Battery is found in me

        Battery

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
Breeding on insanity

        Smashing through the boundaries
        Cannot stop the battery
        Pounding out aggresion
        Turns into obsession
        Cannot kill the battery
        
        Cannot kill the family
        Battery is found in me

        Battery


MASTER OF PUPPETS:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton, Hammett>
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
you're dedicated to
How I'm killing you

        Come crawling faster
        Obey your master
        Your life burns faster
        Obey your master
                  MASTER

        Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
        Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
        Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
        Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
        MASTER
        MASTER
        Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
        MASTER
        MASTER

Neddlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Yor're dedicated to
How I'm killing you

        Come crawling faster
        Obey your master
        Your life burns faster
        Obey your master
                  MASTER

        Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
        Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
        Blinded by me you can't see a thing
        Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
        MASTER
        MASTER
        Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
        MASTER
        MASTER

Master, master, wher's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master, you promised only lies
Laughter, laughter, all I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter, laughing at my cries

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
I will occupy
I will help you dye
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

        Come crawling faster
        Obey your master
        Your life burns faster
        Obey your master
                  MASTER

        Master of puppets I'm pulling your strings
        Swisting your mind and smashing your dreams
        Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
        Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
        MASTER
        MASTER
        Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
        MASTER
        MASTER


THE THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammit>
Messanger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free

        Fearless wretch
        Insanity
        He watches
        Lurking beneath the sea
        Great old one
        Forbidden Sight
        He searches
        Hunter of the shadows is rising
                                 Immortal
                                 In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound

From our ruins once possessed
Falling city, living death

        Fearless wretch
        Insanity
        He watches
        Lurking beneath the sea
        Great old one
        Forbidden Sight
        He searches
        Hunter of the shadows is rising
                                 Immortal
                                 In madness you dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die

Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

        Fearless wretch
        Insanity
        He watches
        Lurking beneath the sea
        Great old one
        Forbidden Sight
        He searches
        Hunter of the shadows is rising
                                 Immortal
                                 In madness you dwell


WELCOME HOME:
(SANITARIUM)
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammit>
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seemed scaried

Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keeped me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's my brain says rage

        Sanitarium, leave me be
        Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us
Listin, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

        Sanitarium, leave me be
        Sanitarium, just leave me alone
        Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutinty in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again


DISPOSABLE HEROES:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett>
Bodies fill the fields I see, hungary heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be
A servant 'till i fall

        Soldier boy, made of clay
        Now an empty shell
        Twenty one, only son
        But he served us well
        Bred to kill, not to care
        Do just as we say
        Finished here, greetings death
        He's yours to take away

        Back to the front
        you'll do what I say, when I say
        Back to the front
        You will die when I say, you will die
        Back to the front
        you coward
        you servant
        you blindman

Barking of machinegun fire, does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bear, glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see
The slaughter never ends

        Soldier boy, made of clay
        Now an empty shell
        Twenty one, only son
        But he served us well
        Bred to kill, not to care
        Do just as we say
        Finished here, greetings death
        He's yours to take away

        Back to the front
        You do what I say, when I say
        Back to the front
        You will die when I say, you will die
        Back to the front
        you coward
        you servant
        you blindman

Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here

I was born for dying

Life planned out before birth, nothing I could say
Had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend
Alone I clench my gun

        Soldier boy, made of clay
        Now an empty shell
        Twenty one, only son
        But he served us well
        Bred to kill, not to care
        Do just as we say
        Finished here, greeting death
        He's yours to take away

        Back to the front
        You will do what I say, when I say
        Back to the front
        You will die when I say, you must die
        Back to the front
        you coward
        you servant
        you blindman

Back to the front
<Splattergut's note-=-=that was a long ass song!>



LEPER MASSIAH:
<Hetfield, Ulrich>
Spineless from the start
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown
Please, please
spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
you will

        Time for lust, time for lies
        Time to kiss your life goodbye
        Send me money, send me green
        Heaven you will meet
        Make a contribution
        And you'll get a better seat
        Bow to leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks, need your sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain
Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see

        Time for lust, time for lie
        Time to kiss your life goodbye
        Send me money, send me green
        Heaven you will meet
        Make a contribution
        And you'll get a better seat
        Bow to leper Messiah

Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

        Time for lust, time for lie
        Time to kiss your life goodbye
        Send me money, send me green
        Heaven you will meet
        make a contribution
        And you'll get a better seat
        
        Lie


ORION:
<Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton>
Well now, we can't exactly write this because there are no words to write!
It is 8 minutes of instrumental......


DAMAGE, INC.:
<Hefield, Ulrich, Hammett, Burton>
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submision
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

        Blood will follow blood
        Dying time is here
        DAMAGE incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out?  You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

        Blood will follow blood
        Dying time is here
        DAMAGE incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
you'll know just where we come from

        DAMAGE incorporated

Damage jackels ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me goin'
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please

        Blood will follow blood
        Dying time is here
        DAMAGE incorporated


FINALLY!!!  So far this album took ME the most time to complete...
When i say "ME", that meant that i did, well....lesse...every bit of it!
I'm not bitchin', well maybe a little, but i didn't get much help on this
one.  Granted that i have the 'puter and all, but still, it could have been
easier. Well, anyways < Can't you see that i'm bored outta my fucking mind?>
I hope you like this text, and that i hope you didn't turn down the loud
muzak you were SUPPOSED to be playing.  Maybe yor parents hate it, maybe your
roomate hates it, or maybe, just maybe, you hate it too!  If you do I pity
you for not being part of the MTV generation.  If you want to challenge this
contact any BBS out there for you to bitch about it to me or blind cyclops.
Next file, we are gonna TRY<!!!>to get a documentary or sometin' about
Metallica, but if not don't worry, it'll be something besides lyrics...
