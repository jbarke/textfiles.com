Introduction

    This Issue has been written on the site of the UPi temperoray WHQ, The
Blue Zone, This is my first & last REAL shot at editing and writing so bear
with this issue.  For starters, let's all just say that The Serious One is no
longer with the group as he WAS bringing down the groups reputation, He was
giving out hacked codes to lamers, and was a member of a lame rival group,
Anarchy International (/AI for short).  He also had never written an article
nor done anything really for the group.  After a RagWar on a local board that
lasted 5 days and 400 messages later we were forced to kick The Serious One out
of the organization.  This is the reason he no-longer appears on the ending
credits.


The Blacklist Section :

This Area is new for the UPi Issue's,  it's one that is here on a trial basis,
it's for those people that by vote or by divine elite HST intervention <grin>
have decided to in fact Blacklist one person or person(s) and basically to let
the WHOLE world know about it.

This issue's blacklistee'(s) are :

Origin:
   Well a couple of my friends and I always go out terrorising on Saturday
nights.  After building the Pipe Bomb's and other fun Anarchist stuff we were
bored and decided to move on to telephone terrorism.  There are many ways
you can hurt people through the common telephone, or cause havoc in the
night.  The following designs suggest a few, and as always, they are ready
for you to improve upon.

The Assassin Box and How to cause line-surge injuries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Do note that this WILL screw up ones Modem as well, unless of course
the modem has a line noise filter attached, this is a theroy, yet untested.

   Materials needed for construction of The Assassin Box:

1. One common car battery or battery of equal voltage, must be portable
2. At least eight feet of tough copper wire, preferable insulated
3. An AT&T test kit, or a splitter box connector [alligator clips,etc.]
4. A gunny sack, or leather bag to put battery in
5. Wire stripper, or raw telephone cord- Grade "G" AT&T manufacture

There MAY be some extra stuff, I'll mention it in the construction.

Construction of Assassin box:

Step 1.

    First, take the test kit and strip it of any overhanging wire or extra
material. You might want to clean it off. Now get out that battery and your
copper wire. You'll see two terminals on the test kit, look like this:


                     *                     *
                     A                     B


    Where A=positive tip, and B=negative tip. Now take about 4 feet of copper
wire and wire the A terminal to the positive bolt on the battery. Make sure
you've grounded yourself, and you should be wearing some kind of protection
against electricity. Next wire the B terminal and the negative bolt with
another four feet of wire. Don't cross wires, and let it hang down [test kit]
over the side of a table, with your battery on the table. Wrap all connections
with electric tape, or solder them if you want to.

Step 2.
    This is the important part. You now just about have a working box. Put it
all in the bag or sack, and carry it with you [along with your supplies]
to your victim's house. Go to the back of the house, or on the side where
the Lighting & Power register is [metal box]. Now near that you should
find a little black, grey, or green, sometimes white, box with a pop-off
lid. Slide your hands underneath and pull the cover off. Note: I've seen
boxes where you have to unscrew it first. Almost all of them have the BELL
telephone logo on them. This is the connection box, or trunk connection, that
connects your house to Ma Bell's network.
Inside you will find four terminals...although some have five.
Here's how I label them.



                                                        Page 2



                    *                           *
                    A                           B

                                 *
                                 E

                    *                           *
                    C                           D

      Got it? Good... now look at the terminals closely. The ones for your
use will be C and D. Also, B and D might come in handy. The C terminal should
be connected to a red wire coming out of the house. The D should have a green.
If they don't, see which ones do. When you find them, get out your assassin
box [battery and test kit]. Now take the two prongs [alligator clips]and attach
the red one to the terminal with the red wire connected. Next take the green
[or black] prong and slip onto the terminal with the green wire connected.
You now have an operating assassin box. Just lay it down there, or bury it
in the ground [that's why it's in a sack].

Step 3.

This final step is just a bunch of helpful things to do to hide your great new
box.

1.  If you haven't buried it, put grass all over and atop it. Make it look
like it's just a clump of grass, or a bush.

2.  IF it's buried, try to tape the wires together [Note: If they're not
insulated, don't worry about this part. Make sure the battery is well covered
and moisture cannot get to it. This might call for wrapping it up in
some form of cellophane or plastic cover-all.

3.   Put the cover BACK on the connection box, or close the door. If it has
a screwable cover, don't screw it back in. Just make sure it looks like
it's closed and secure.

4.   Now stand back about ten feet, and see if it's visible. If it is, then
do what is feasible to protect it.

Line-surge injuries with the Assassin box:

The whole point of making an assassin box is to scare, or hurt your enemy.
No better way to do this than a shock of electricity right in the ear.  Now
the box will send extra voltage through the line when your victim picks up
the phone [call coming through]. Note: this box sometimes causes funny
effects, like ringing a phone automatically [voltage surge], or messing up a
call. But most of the time it is effective.



                                                        Page 3


Some sample scenarios:

1.  Your victim picks up the phone to dial. He might notice a tingling
vibration in his hand. Dial tone might be filled with static. As soon as
he dials, the earpiece will fill with static, and voltage will be applied
to the reciever and earpiece of the phone. This usually results in a
bad shock.

2.  This is more common. He will pick up the phone, and touch the keypad.
The KEYPAD will shock him. Now when a line goes into the phone, direct
current is applied for your call, while alternating current rings the bell
in the phone. Your 120 or so applied volts will most likely stay resident
in the bell or keypad area. When a button is pushed, it will come in
contact with the extra voltage, thus shock.

3.  Other things are always possible, like the destruction of vital
circuitry in the phone, which results in the defilement of the instrument.

Well, that's just about it for this time.  The plans will be effective,
unless you build it wrong, and I shouldn't be blamed for your total lack of
electronic skills.

DISCLAIMER:
     I, Grim Reaper, am not responsible for the death or injuries involved
with my design. IF it kills the dude, YOU are responsible.

        How To Rip Off Pay Phones
        -------------------------

    Introduction.
    -------------

          Phone ripping is a great way to earn money and it is very
          flexible you can choose your own hours, work part time,
          full time or casual. And it is one of the few thefts that
          you can actuly do in public and not have to worry about
          people looking or not.(coin ripping only!) So where did it
          originate? well i believe i was one of the first in Melbourne
          to think of such a great money making venture. But i latter
          discovered that americans had been doing this since the 60's.

    Vocabulary
    ----------

          Motherload   :-   More than $25 from one phone.

          Motherloader :-   A phone that always produces $25 plus.

          Slow Flow    :-   Placing too many tisues in a box can
                            cause money to come out a little at a time.

          Jam or Jama  :-   When it is so full that money RAINS down
                            causing the door to close and jam shut !



     Slot Ripping
     ------------

          In order to know how to rip you must first know the coin
          return and its hazards. Here is a basic diagram of a coin
          slot shown on a view of the right side of box.
               ____                    _______
               |   \                  /      µ
               |    \    catch       /       ¶
               | \   \   coins     /         ³
                  \   \  here     /          ³
                   \             /           ³
                    \            \_          ³

                          \                  ³
                           \                 ³
                            \                ³
                                             ³
                |\                          /
                | \     coin fall here    /
                |__>_____________________/




     Sorry about the basic drawing but i am sure you will get the idea.



     What You Need
     -------------


          Now before going to a box lets get organised you will need
          the following:-

                           1 melways
                           1 box of tisues
                           1 piece of THIN wire (1.5 mm thick or less)
                           30 one cent coins
                           1 tac (or nail)
                           10 bandades


                                                        Page 5



     How Much Can be Made
     --------------------


          Ok guys, its time to do some mapping, open up your melways and
          find all the telephone boxes you can walk to (ride, drive to etc)
          and make i mental list it takes 10 phone boxes emptied 5 times
          a week to earn aprox $300 a week (give or take a little depending
          on where you live. i used to do woek at hungy jacks in the city,
          and was earning about 185 bucks an week at jacks and about 500
          bucks a week doing 8 boxes,4 times a week (so the money is good!)


     Doing The Job
     -------------


          Aproch the box as if you are going to make a call. This is not
          just so you dont look suspicous but it is an idea to test the phone
          by making a free call to the operator (in most phones the money will
          come back out) thus you know the phone is working, to save you the
          trouble of PAPERING a phone that does not work. If the phone works
          yet does not exept money then you are in luck you have found a
          phone that can make up to $82 in one day (max holding!!!) this
          phone is named a SLOT MACHINE ! but be carefull because they can
          easily turn into a MOTHERLOAD JAMA. ok so if all is ok you can then
          start inserting tisues into the coin slot. Place a few at a time
          and then push them up the slot (BUT NOT TOO FAR!!) test that there
          are no leaks by inserting four one cent coins down the slot. This
          is also good cause you can see if anyone has taken money from your
          phone and reset the tisues your 4 cents will be missing.


                 OK now is the really hard part. When you think it is just
          about time to collect your hard earned cash  use a bandade or 2
          and tape the tiny nail to your finger (This is helpful but if you
          have long fingers you can do it without) push you finger up the
          slot making sure it is against the left was if the coin slot
          (so you miss the small but sometimes NASTY little spike) Now
           scoop the paper down and there is your cash!!!


     Notes
     -----


          Some phones use a door like this    =============
          so that fingers can not put pushed    \         |
          up into the slot (thats where the      \        |
          thin wire comes in) bend the wire       \  |    |
          and place the paper up with it and       \==    |
          remove it the same way.                 ----------


          If you find a phone that is hard or
          imposable to do than just super
          glue the top so they have to use
          the phone that you HAVE papered!


          Never use telephone book paper!
