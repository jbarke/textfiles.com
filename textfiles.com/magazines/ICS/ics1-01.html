	Since the creation of Internet, US publishing companies have been 
toying with the idea of doing their business over your modem.  Various 
problems ranging from a general lack of action to monetary control of 
redistributed information have plagued the development of fast, electronic
information from its conception.  A few brave underground netsurfers who 
have developed publication standards for their own media have forgotten 
that a mainstream world exists outside of their own electronic universe.  
	We at ICS have dedicated ourselves and our limited resources to 
two goals.  The first concerns the idea that most of the 
staff here would like to perceive themselves as pioneers of sorts.  We 
would like to develop ICS into the modern, electronic equivalent of 
mainstream, literary/futuristic, paper-media publication containing 
not only contemporary works but advertisements as well.  In addition, ICS
will be exploring the world of rights.  We would like to find ways to 
ensure that all of our writers have rights to the information they
produce.  Over the long term, we hope ICS can act as a catalyst for 
developing this technology.
	The second goal on our agenda concerns the state of 
information today.  We strongly believe that information is power and 
through the proper use of such power we can help shape the future in a 
positive manner through the opinions of our readers.  That is why ICS is
dedicating itself to written discussion through a "Letters" section 
that will appear in every issue as comments from our readers find there 
way here.  Your letters will help to improve ICS Electrozine and create 
standards for others to fallow.  In addition, we accept submissions 
from anyone with something to say.
	The hypothetical future is starting now.  We hope ICS can become a 
leader in the development of "Electronic Journalism" as well as please its 
readers with its content.  We would welcome anything you have to 
contribute.

  Back in my early cultural memory, there is a child's story about a
fish who wanted to be a bird.  I remember none of the particulars--
only that, at the end of it, the fish was finally at peace with its
fishy destiny, and no longer trying to adapt to a new medium.
  This story re-emerges in my consciousness from time to time, when I
seem to find myself in the position of "wishing I were a bird."  This
happened years ago in college, when I spent two increasingly
frustrating and bewildering years trying to be a math major, before
finally conceding what the aptitude tests had shown me as a freshman: 
that I was pretty weak in abstract thinking skills.  I guess I had
spent those two years listening to another of our cultural stories, the
story of "the little engine who thought it could."  I see the flaw in
my logic, of course--the little engine didn't think it could be
something other than just a better engine.
  I had cause to think of all that again, however, when I was
approached last semester by a student representing a small group of
"netsurfers" who wanted to experiment with an "electrozine"--an
electronic magazine to be distributed over computer networks.  Meeting
with them, I realized that I was talking with people who were not just
"computer literate";  some of these cybernauts were potential Marlowes
and Shakespeares of this emerging literacy. 
  Myself, I am able to fumble my way into a word-processing program and
use the computer as a glorified typewriter--to a real cybernaut, I
think, the equivalent of using a Ferarri to plow the fields.  My
immediate response was suspicion:  why weren't they approaching people
in the computer field for help?  But they knew what they wanted:  they
knew where to find help for the technical problems, but their real
interest was in attaining to a degree of JOURNALISTIC legitimacy.  They
told me about the 'zines already in existence--primarily either
underground hacker journals like PHRACK or highly specialized exchanges
of abstruse information among scientists and others involved in narrow
fields of expertise.  
  What they wanted to do was to create a mainstream, general interest
'zine that would help bring more people in to this new world they had
discovered through Western's connection with Internet--people with
literary, artistic and humanistic backgrounds as well as the scientific
groups.  In a sense, then, they were trying to bridge back from what
they saw as their future in the electronic realms into my present in
the print medium.  In the largest sense, they wanted to do what they
could to bridge the "Two Cultures" gap between the physical sciences
and the arts and humanities that C.P. snow brought to a general
awareness in his famous 1959 address at Cambridge.
  I was intrigued.  But I was also very aware of being a fish among
birds.  I never had the feeling that they were, like academics
sometimes do, using specialized language to exclude me;  they really
wanted to answer my questions, but the answers required translations
and definitions every few words, which led to discussions among
themselves of the best way to help me understand--I felt like Caliban
talking to Prospero.  
  I disabused my cybernauts immediately of any hope of my "leading
them" into this venture in the standard teacher-student relationship. 
If, however, they were truly serious about trying to build bridges
between these vast and magical electronic spaces, and the dark confused
hearts of all the people who secretly hate and fear the complex
technologies without which they could no longer survive, then I could
probably provide them with a "learning experience":  they would teach
me--a hardcore print person since I first cracked a book, but also one
who knows something about journalism, and about learning --what they
wanted to do, and how to do it; then together we could probably figure
out how to bring the campus into it.  
  Which is, I have learned, no harder than bringing the known universe
into it.  These incredible machines, linked up as they are in networks,
simply eliminate space, distance, as a relevant concern.  I learned-
-the hard way (the cybernauts forgot to ask anybody about a "mass
mailing," and made a mistake or two too)--that one hundred thousand
people can be contacted personally with an ease and lack of expense
that makes the direct-mail industry look ridiculously wasteful as well
as obsolete.  (Some of those contacted got mad, the same way I get
disgusted about junk mail in the mailbox--a couple even did the
electronic equivalent of wrapping the "return postage paid" envelop
around a brick and mailing it back.)  
  At any rate--here I sit, deep in the Colorado Rockies, an aging
journalism and writing instructor, trying to keep up with a small group
of students who are full of energy, interest, and even idealism for a
future I have tended to look at with apprehension when I look at it at
all.  Why don't students like these ever find their way into my regular
classes?  That's a question I will have to look at sideways for a
while;  it's too cruel to confront directly.  
  But as you are reading this--locally on campus, in Greece, Australia,
or wherever--know that my students are educating me;  the fish might
yet learn to fly.  The presence of this in the Electrozine proves that
I've at least found the magic buttons for creating a TEXT file, and my
glorified typewriter is sprouting its electronic wings.  So I'll never
be anything more than just a flying fish--that's okay.  To paraphrase
T.S. Eliot, fishkind cannot bear too much reality.
  And I join the rest of the Electrozine staff in inviting you to
become part of it:  if you don't like what you find here, write a
letter or write something better, and send it on--you're just a pulse
away in this new world.  And the generic appearance of a TEXT file
certainly needn't reflect a generic or homogenous world.

(____)t is late at night and you pass by the campus computer lab.  You
turn to see a familiar row of people.  A thought passes through your 
head, WOW! THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR OVER EIGHT HOURS.  This is amazing,
you can't believe so many people are interested in using the computers 
for so long.  This shocks you more, because these people were never in 
the lab until the recent connection with internet was established, and
soon after the MUDs were discovered.  MUD origionally was an acronym
for Multi-User Dungeon, but now has grown to mean Multi-User Games of
all types. 

 ___
(_ _)
 //	                   --------------
(_)he MUDS have entered the academic computer scene like a tool for 
inspiring computer literacy, but to some bystanders it seems just like
a new social disease.  These MULTI-USER GAMES that allow people to
participate in the game with people all around the world are at first
wonderful and enjoyable to the explorer.
	The explorer stumbles upon the MUD and plays for an hour or so.
Then the explorer sees a couple of friends and says "Hey, I found a neat
game, come check it out."  Things go well at first, as many of the
explorer's friends that only have a passing interest in computers begin
to play these games with great enthusiasm and interest.
	It begins with the person connecting to their first MUD 
experience.  They begin to do what it is normally difficult to get 
people learning the computer to do.  They use the HELP facilities and
read the instructions.  They quickly learn to communicate, move, and
slip into the role of their electronic character.  As a learning tool
the MUDS seem to surpass most other programs at the speed in which the
users learn to manipulate information.  However, this soon levels off.
	Initially some of the new MUD players will realize that they are
spending far too much time playing these games, and will quit playing 
them.  However, many seem to be afflicted just as many drug addicts are
afflicted.  They begin to skip classes, meals, and social gatherings. 
Their daily conversation outside of MUD games starts to become laced 
with discussion of MUDS and MUD terminology.  When deprived from the
game for long enough, they even appear to show evidence of behavior
similar to withdrawal symptoms of addicts.  When a person on the
side lines sees this they often wonder what could motivate such 
behavior.  These people usually will try out a MUD to see what all the
fuss is about.
	These curious people usually end up in one of two categories:
the MUD addict and the realistic.  The new MUD addict will usually
gradually slip into the same behavioral patterns as other MUD addicts.
The realistic person will be aware of some things that he/she did not
know prior to playing the MUD.
	The MUDS are a society unto themselves.  The MUD addiction is
not confined to just one native machine, and one computer lab.  It could
very well be happening on a computer near you.  The game has regular
players from around the world.  The players follow a make believe 
role/ritual that changes very little once they have it perfected.  Often
this society will closely resemble that portrayed in a television soap
opera, and other times it will resemble a hack and slash battle world 
where you strive for power and greater weapons with which to kill ever
bigger monsters.
	One would think that after playing one of these games for 
hundreds, even thousands of hours, a person would get tired of the
ritual and the rules long since mastered.  It doesn't work that way.
Many bystanders have not been able to reason how people could gradually
slip further from real life and begin to base their life around 
something that is not tangible and often is destroyed.  But, still they
giggle, yell, battle, and often claim to fall in love over the MUDS.
	Often the MUD players fail to see their real life (what they 
call RL) friends, and the MUD terminology begins to be used in life
outside the games.  The Hacker's Dictionary mentioned that the MUDHEAD
was someone that would play the games incessantly, and would often
fail or drop out of their degrees/programs.  This appears to be the case
in some instances.  Going to class and playing MUDS 8-10 hours a day does
not leave much time for anything else.  When the MUDS are being played this
much it becomes the equivalent in time of a FULL TIME job.  Taking on
a FULL TIME MUD PLAYING job usually leaves the person with two options.
Drop out of school and take on a real FULL TIME JOB so that the bills
can still be paid, or quit playing MUDS and get a job while going to
school so that the bills can be paid, because there is not much room
for doing all three.
	At some campuses it sometimes becomes difficult for students 
wanting to do homework to find a terminal, because of the sea of intense
MUD players.  This is a problem that plagues Systems Administrators. 
The general options are disallowing INTERNET functions to students (other
than EMAIL), setting up counter programs so that people can use TELNET
(or RLOGIN) only when the labs are fairly empty, or policing the area with
LAB MONITORS. These options all seem to have problems.
	The option of disallowing internet functions other than MAIL 
takes away students' ability to reach vast amounts of information.  While it
may solve many of the problems facing the Systems Administrator it will
still take away incredible learning and educational opportunities.
	The option of setting up a counter program is probably the one
most favorably viewed by both MUD players and students that have to deal
with them.  The counter programs have flaws though.  To date most 
counter programs generally make an initial check before allowing people
to TELNET or RLOGIN.  The problem with this is, that the counter program
will generally make no additional checks, so the MUD player can remain
in the game for eight or more hours even if the lab fills up to 
capacity.  The general solution posed by solution seekers is to have the
counter programs invoke in a sub-process every so often that does 
another count and disconnects(or warns) the MUD player when conditional
limits are exceeded.  The problem with this is that most Systems 
Administrators also look with distaste at programs that require a 
sub-process.  It is most likely that a program could be devised that 
would solve these problems, but the program has yet to have been 
announced to the majority of Systems Administrators.
	The third option of having LAB MONITORS that "police" the labs 
has its merits, but also has several problems.  The merits are that the MUD 
players can always be monitored and removed when the need arises.  The
problem is that the LAB MONITORS are generally students themselves, and
end up getting battered by insults and anger, and often lose friends while
carrying out their duty of removing GAME PLAYERS when the lab is so full.
	MUDS could well be the next evolution in social diseases, as 
well as the catalyst for even less effective workers. Some may wonder
whether the last is really a loss, but others think of it as a terrible
thing.  The future human will be faced with many strange/new situations
and the solutions will often be quite evasive.
	The epidemic could get you, your friend, or even everyone soon.
Keep an eye out, and try to manage your life the way you think it should
be managed.  Things could get worse once real virtual reality based 
games enter the scenes, for they will be even more realistic and thus
will most likely be more addictive than existing games.

	Honest, nice, and tortured: that was my friend John.  Until I 
met John, I thought I was a great judge of people.  The first time I saw 
him he was on the football field at our high school during my sophomore 
year and his junior year.  The other cheerleaders and I were going 
through the cheer that our school used wherever the team scored a 
touchdown.  The one that showed our legs the most and made our skirts 
spin up high.
	"TOUCHDOWN SCORED BY #34 JOHN WELCH," the loud speaker 
announced.
	When the cheer was over I felt a firm slap on my ass that stung 
like a son-of-a-bitch.  I turned to face the bastard that had goosed me, 
expecting to see the guy walking off like nothing had happened, but 
instead I was confronted by one of the wide-receivers of the team 
standing real close to me.  Normally I would have punched him but the 
look on his face was so apologetic that I held my hand at my side.
	"Sorry about that, Lucy, but there is a bet going on with the team 
that I won't be able to get away with slapping your butt every time  
I score a touchdown.  I can't back down from a challenge like that.  
Nothing personal."
	"Why am I the center of this bet?" I demanded.
	"Because you racked that linebacker Frank when he goosed you at 
a party.  You're considered a major challenge by the other team 
members."
	"Your eyes are brown," I replied.
	"So?"
	"So I say that you're a liar and full of shit."
	"I'm sorry that you feel that way," he said and walked away.
	I watched after him as he retreated, a big 34 and the name WELCH 
printed on the back of his jersey.  A smear of mud made the 3 on his 
jersey look like an 8.  When he arrived at the team bench he was greeted 
by multiple slaps on his back that shook his shoulder pads.  His manner 
had been so open, almost nervous, that I couldn't help but think about 
him.  Any other football players would have been cocky and arrogant, 
especially after scoring a touchdown.  But he had acted like a boy who 
had been dared to kiss a girl on the lips in third grade.  I wanted to 
have a chance to talk alone with him. I didn't get the moment I wanted 
that night.  He did slap me on the ass twice more that game though.  I 
didn't complain.
	I saw John Welch at his house two nights later.  Apparently he 
used the money he had won in the ass-slapping bet to acquire a keg and 
he held a party at his house while his parents were away.  Being 
one of the women on the cheerleading team got me an invitation to 
the party.  I had been at the party for about half-an-hour before I saw 
John checking the cash flow with the two linebackers who were taking the 
cover charges at the door. 
	 I forced my way through the crowd towards John and 
managed to get to him without any of the guys at the party 
'accidently' caressing my butt once.  I guessed that my reputation of 
being a lady who wouldn't let a guy, besides John, take even the 
slightest liberty with my body without paying a heavy and painful 
penalty had worked its way into the minds of all the team members.  John 
was facing away from me when I snuck up behind him.  His rear profile 
was very impressive even though he only had the build of a receiver.  
Built for speed and endurance, not for the stand-still-and-toss-about 
job of the two L-backers at the door.  John and all the 'bouncers' were 
dressed in suits and ties but without shirts, so they were easily 
recognizable as the people who were in charge of this party.  The 
overall effect of the outfits were very becoming.  I stood behind him 
for about twenty seconds before I decided to make my presence known by 
goosing him real hard on the butt.  He spun about fast and looked like 
he was ready to kick-ass until he saw me.
	"Paybacks are a bitch aren't they?" I asked.  He stared at me 
with a look on his face like there was something in his throat and 
didn't say anything.  His mouth was open slightly and his tongue was 
moving like he was trying to say something.
	"What's the matter?  Cat got your tongue?" I asked him.
	His face assumed a more normal composure.  "I'm just surprised 
that you're talking to me after the game this weekend.  But I'm glad 
you are."
	"Don't believe I wasn't mad.  I don't know why but you just 
seemed different from the other players."
	"I guess that I just have a different attitude than the other 
players."
	"And why is that?  What makes you such a Joe Cool stud and not 
an asshole?"
	"I'm not a 'Joe Cool Stud'.  I just come from a small town 
originally.  I treat people differently is all."
	"Do you have any pictures of your home town?" I asked, trying to 
get him talking about himself.
	"Yeah, I do.  Would you like to look at them?"
	I nodded.
	We wove our way through the crowd and up the stairs, stepping 
over Frank's legs where he sat on the stairs studying his beer glass.  
John's room was the third door on the left, with a picture of last 
year's football team on it.  I waited until he turned on the light before 
I followed him in.
	"Go ahead and sit down." he said, as he opened his closet and 
walked in.   "It'll be a second.  My photos are in here somewhere."
 	I sat down on his queen sized bed and ran my hand over the lion 
pattern covers, then I positioned my skirt so that most of my legs would 
be seen when he came out of the closet.
	"I can't find them," his voice drifted from the closet then he 
came walking out.  I uncrossed my legs then crossed them again.  He 
didn't show any outward signs of noticing.  "I guess we won't be able to 
talk about my past."  I slid over and he sat down, covering the lion next 
to me.
	"Well then I guess that we should start up with the usual 
questions.  Tell me about yourself."
	"O.K.  I'm six feet tall, one hundred sixty eight pounds; I have 
no brothers so all my father's boyhood dreams are mine to try to 
accomplish; I have three sisters who are with my folks this evening and 
we have no pets.  How's that for starters?"
	"Sounds incomplete to me."
	"Well, then tell me your story and I'll try to tell mine better."
	I sighed then shifted my position on the bed of lions.  "My name 
is Lucy Sanders, I'm five foot four and I'm an only child.  Until my 
mother died I used to take gymnastics and Ken-po Karate, which I have a 
brown belt in, but when she was killed in a carwreck my father decided 
that it was time to become a drunk and use all the money for karate to 
help him achieve constant oblivion.  This was almost two years ago.  My 
father lost his job with the police and has been working odd jobs for 
the last year.  He abuses me whenever he drinks, and I'm going to loose 
my temper on him someday.  But for now I can convince myself that it's 
his lack of steady work that is causing his problems.  I get straight 
A's and love biology.  And I think you're cute."
	He sat silently for a while, just staring at me.  I began to 
wonder which part of my story was making him think so hard.
	"Why don't you beat your father up?  Use your Karate on him?"
	"He knows some himself, Judo mostly, and he is very big."
	I didn't want to continue the conversation in this direction.  
It made me think of feelings and possible actions that were in my 
thoughts too much already.  "What about your father?"
	"My father is a big guy too.  He doesn't try to beat up on me 
anymore, just hits me once in a while.  He is constantly riding my 
back, bitching at me to be the best and to never back down...to be what 
he never was, a Pro.  My mom is a pushover and does everything he says." 
John paused for a little while.  "This conversation is getting 
depressing; let's find something new to talk about."
	"Sounds good to me," I smiled.  He began to turn his head and 
look around his room.
	"Hey, there's my photo book."  He leaned back and took the book 
off the headboard of his bed.  "Do you still wanna' see them?"
	My head bobbed.
	We spent the rest of the night flipping through his old 
pictures.  John told a story about each one.  I never saw any pictures 
of the girl-friends that he talked about having, and we never made out.

                  *              *              *

	Over the next two months I only saw John at the games and at 
parties.  He didn't seem to have a steady girl-friend but he was always 
real friendly with all the women.  My father started to drink more and 
I would go to school with new bruises everyday, some even on my face.  
After the second time I went to school with a black eye I received a 
note saying that my father and I were to meet with a man from child 
crisis management.  If my mother had still been alive I bet she would 
have gone with no complaints.  
	I showed my father the note after I served dinner 
to him that night.  I was hoping that the food would have 
sobered him up so he wouldn't get mad.  But he had more to drink 
than normal and hit me twice, HARD.  I finally lost control of myself 
and hit him once in the stomach, stabbed him just below the sternum with 
the steak-knife that I'd been holding, and hit him in the nose hard 
enough to break it.  
	I called the ambulance five minutes later when I gave up on
trying to stop the blood from flowing out the stab wound.  He lived.

                  *             *              * 

	I spent the rest of that school year living in a foster home and 
going to school at a place called 'Cottage.'  I began to smoke and drink 
a lot.  I didn't see any of my old friends at all.  One night, three 
weeks into the summer, I was hanging out with some of the other 
delinquent kids from 'Cottage' at an all night coffee shop called 'The 
Traveler.'  Most of the other people who were there were stoners or 
metal-heads.  
	A commotion started near the front door.  It looked like a 
preppie had decided to go slumming and had run afoul of four skin-heads.  
It took me a second to realize that the preppie was actually John Welch.  
Before I could suggest to my friends, Dan and Josh, that we should help 
John out both Dan and Josh had gotten up and were heading towards the 
front of 'The Traveler.'  Both Dan and Josh had been in enough fights  
where they had been outnumbered by football players that they couldn't 
help but to get on the side of the underdog.  Just seconds before Dan 
and Josh had reached the front John turned and walked out the door with 
the skin-heads right behind him.  When the three of us had cleared the 
door to the coffee shop we found John facing down all four skin-heads.  
We walked up behind the four growths-of-filth and Dan  introduced us 
with an impressive yell.
	"HEY!  How about a fair fight you neo-nazi shit-heads?"
	They turned around and seemed quite taken back by the sight of 
the three of us.  I had know that the skin-heads would back down as soon 
as we began to move towards them.  Dan was 6'3" and weighed over 200 
pounds, all of it muscle.  Josh was about 5'6" and weighed about 180 
pounds, also all muscle.  And I knew that I was bad-ass enough to screw 
up at least one of the skin-heads before he had moved more than a dozen 
feet.  
	Johns eyes widened in recognition when he saw me and he smiled. 
The skin-heads backed off, leaving with the usual threats of revenge 
that most bullies use when the have to protect their pride.  After they 
had gotten in their car and driven off I introduced everybody to each 
other.  Everyone exchanged greetings and shook hands.
	"Thanks for the help," John said.  "They would have kicked my 
ass but I was too mad to care."
	'No prob'," Josh said, "But the skin-heads might come back 
still.  And with more help.  How did you get here?"
	"I walked."
	"Well how would you like a ride back home in my car?"
Josh asked.
	"That would be great."
	John and I talked  all the way to his apartment.  Apparently 
his parents had gone on vacation to Europe with his sisters and had left 
him here for the summer.  They had also sold their house and were going 
to move in to a new one at the end of the summer.  So for the summer 
John was living with his roommate, named Mike, and was working two jobs 
to pay rent.  I told him about how cool my new foster parents were.  He 
asked if I would be returning to the  high school for the new year and 
looked happy when I said yes.  My two friends and I walked with John up 
to his third floor apartment and decided to stay awhile when he offered 
us a couple of beers to us for our help.  We were there for the better 
part of an hour shooting the bull with John and Mike before I had to 
leave or risk pissing off my foster parents.  John gave me a hug 
goodbye.
	On the way home I commented about how fine I thought John was.  
Dan looked at Josh and laughed once.
	"I don't think she knows what he is," he said.
	"Neither do I," said Josh.
	"What do you mean?" I asked.
	"Here's a hint," Dan said.  "John's apartment is a one bedroom 
apartment."
	It took me a second to make the connection.  John was a 
homosexual.

                     *            *             * 

	Classes started and I returned to Johns' school like I said I 
would.  He had moved back in with his parents so he didn't have to work 
while going to school.  A strong feeling of friendship formed between 
Mike, John, and I.  We hung out together all the time and a lot of 
people thought that both the guys were dating me or that we were in to 
group sex or something like that.  Together we worked our way through 
the first semester of classes with no problem.  I rejoined the 
cheerleading team and John was giving his all on the football team, 
hoping for a scholarship to a good college.  Mike was smart enough to 
get into any college he wanted with a full academic scholarship.
	The first semester ended and Christmas break was a nice relaxing  
time.  In January, two days before the second semester started I 
received a phone call from John.
	"Lucy, I'm really screwed," Johns' voice was shaking badly.
	"What's the matter?" I asked.
	"I told my dad that I went to the mall today, with David Helms.  
But I used the car to go pick up Mike and bring him back to my house.  I 
thought that my dad was going to be gone at work all day but he came 
home early."
	"Oh shit," was all I could say.
	"He saw Mike and me together.  I've never seen
him so mad in all my life.  He stormed in and nearly beat Mike 
with a chair but Mike blazed out the door.  Then he started calling me a 
fag and hit me a few times.  He said that he was going to call Mikes' 
parents and tell them everything.  He pulled me into the study and 
started to yell again.  God I'm fucked.  Mike isn't much better off.  
His parents are thinking of sending him away to military school.   What 
do I do?"
	"Drive over to my house and we'll take it from there."
	"My dad took my car keys."
	"I'll come get you then."
	"O.K."
	"Don't worry John, it'll all work out."
	"I hope so."

                 *             *             *

	School started again and John and I faced the first day with 
feelings of doubt and fear.  We hadn't seen Mike again; apparently he 
was somewhere with relatives back east.  He would be going to military 
school the next semester.  I wished John good luck when we separated to 
go to our first classes.  Time dragged through the first three classes as 
I waited for lunch when I could see John again.  When he didn't show up 
at our usual meeting place I got worried.  I skipped my next class to 
try to find him.  Then I heard rumors that he had been in a fight in the 
boys locker-room.  Someone said that he had tried to call John at his 
house and his father replied that his 'fag son doesn't live here 
anymore.'  He had started to tease John, and John attacked the guy.   
John's dad was called to come get John since John wasn't eighteen yet.  
As a result of the fight John was suspended and kicked off the football  
team.  I went to the nearest payphone to call Johns' house but the phone 
was busy.  Next I tried my foster house to talk to my 'mother'.
	"John just called here," she said.  "he sounded very upset.  
All he said was to tell you goodbye.  I tried to call him back but the 
phone must be off the hook.  What happened at school, Lucy?"
	"Call the police, mom.  Tell them to go to John's house.  I'll 
tell you why later," I said and hung up.
	John only lived about twenty minutes away if you walked.  I 
sprinted to his house using every shortcut that I knew.  The cold air 
hurt my lungs with every breath and the foot-and-a-half deep snow made 
running hard.  By the time I reached John's neighborhood the fastest I 
could move was at a slow jog.  I slipped on the top of a brick wall in 
the back of the last yard I needed to cut across.  I landed on top of the 
bricks with my ribs under my right arm and fell into the yard.  The 
world darkened as I fought to keep from passing out.  I couldn't seem to 
find the energy to get up and I stayed lying in a snow drift for several 
minutes.  Then I heard the sound of a gun going off, a big gun.  I 
forced myself to stand up and move.  My ribs began to feel very numb for 
some reason but I ignored them.
	The world seemed to turn into a T.V. show with the volume turned 
down.  The only noise I could hear was my own breathing.  I crossed the 
back yard and began to jog slowly across the front yard into the street 
when I heard the second gun shot.
	"No," I said under my breath.  "NO!" I moved across the street 
to the front door and kicked it.  I don't remember any jolt or noise.  
The door was just there one moment then open the next and I was inside.
I heard faint police sirens in the distance.  In side it smelled like 
the Fourth of July.  I didn't see or hear anyone so I went up the stairs 
towards the bedrooms.  The door with a picture of the football team was 
slightly open.  I shoved it out of my way and stepped into the room.  
The room stunk like gun powder, and then I noticed the blood splattered 
on the wall.  My gaze dropped to the floor and I saw a pair of feet 
sticking out from behind the bed.  My ribs hurt now and it was hard to 
breath.  My vision tunneled until I could only see the feet.  I felt 
weak, fell to my knees and crawled across the floor.  The first thing I 
noticed was that the face looked like it had a red hood over it.  The 
next thing I noticed was that it was the body of John's father.  
I passed out.

                   *              *               *

	When I woke up it was two days later and I found myself in a 
hospital bed with my foster parents sitting next to me.  I felt very 
groggy because the doctors had me on some kind of sedation.  I was awake 
long enough to find out what happened.  After John had killed his father 
he had gone down stairs and killed himself with a .44 in the back yard.  
I had broken my ribs and was in the hospital for the next week.  
Johns' funeral was the next day but I was unable to attend.  After 
the investigation I was able to keep John's diary as a memory of my 
friend.

will be told. If you yourself have a tale that you think
others might find interesting or informative, send it to ICS.

(__  __)                ---------------
  (__)he wind was blowing through the cottonwood trees, pine trees, and 
aspen trees bringing fresh summer smells to the nostrils of the four 
youths as they walked down the dusty road.  The sun was warm and the 
heat was high in the clothing of the young boys.  Cotton floated in the 
air only to be pitched around by the winds coming off of the mountains 
that surrounded the valley.
	Not far ahead of the boys was an old white house with peeling 
paint, and old fading green trim.  The windows to the house were smoky 
with age, and heavy on the bottom where the glass had slowly expanded
over time.
	They were there because one youth had overheard a conversation
between his mother and the lady who owned the house next door to the
decrepid house.  The lady had been busily telling his mother about strange
figures of little kids that would attempt to play with the lady's dogs in
the night and the dogs would act terrified.  Eventually the spectral
children would vanish.
	This youth as well as many of his friends was interested in
bigfoot, UFOs, ghosts, and anything else unusual.  So, soon the boy was
listening to any rumors he heard about that house and anything in its
general vicinity.
	Over time the boy and some of his friends had learned that some 
children had once lived in the old house next door, and that they had
died of small pox and were then buried up on a large ridge behind the 
house known as Hog's Back.  The evidence kept suggesting that the house
would indeed reveal some interesting things if only the boys would go 
and investigate long enough.
	Finally one day the boys got an interesting idea.  Why not
try to see if a tape recorder would pick up anything.  The boys felt
this was a great idea as long as no one was around to see them making a
fool of themselves.
	When they finally stood semi-close to the old house that had
cottonwood branches in full bloom draping around the roof, they began to
joke and wait for someone brave enough(or crazy enough) to carry the tape
recorder to the porch. They had all already unanimously decided that they
did not want to stand close to the house when yelling their questions at
the "ghost." They kept talking about how scared they would be if they saw
something looking at them through the windows of this house.
	At last one boy grabbed the tape recorder, ran up to the old 
short porch and deposited the tape recorder on the porch. He ran as fast 
as he could back out to the others standing ten yards away.
	The boys began to shout questions.  The questions were basically
these.
WE WANT TO HELP YOU, WE WILL MAKE PEOPLE KNOW YOU ARE HERE.
SHOW US A SIGN THAT YOU ARE HERE.
TELL US YOUR NAME, SAY IT IN THE TAPE RECORDER, DON'T SAY IT OUT LOUD.
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?
	These questions were shouted fairly loudly so that they could be 
picked up by the tape recorder that was ten yards away.  Finally after
yelling questions and statements long enough to fill up about fifteen
minutes of tape one of the boys ran and got the tape recorder and they 
proceeded to one of the boy's forts.
	The Fort was behind the boy's trailer home, and was constructed 
of plywood boards.  All of the boys squeezed into the fort and sat on
a foam mattress that they liked to refer to as the couch. The boy was 
finally handed his tape recorder which he had been rewinding on the way 
home.
	The boy pressed play and set the tape recorder on the ground and 
listened for a moment.  Yep, their voices started shouting questions.
	After about two minutes of listening the youth in the fort got 
distracted as youth at that age often do.  They began to joke and listen 
less intently to the tape recorder. Then it happened.
TELL US YOUR NAME , then the very loud inhuman voice while the boys 
question was muffled in the background as it finished DON't SAY IT OUT
LOUD, SAY IT IN THE TAPE RECORDER.
	The boys described the voice then as being a cross between a pig 
and a deep human voice.  The sound began with a loud scratch that 
sounded like the screen of a screen door. It just so happens that there
was a screen door two feet away from the tape recorder.
	After the scratch the INHUMAN VOICE said something.  At the time
the boys thought it said LEE very forcibly, because they were expecting
a name to go along with their question.  The boys excitedly ran around
the town playing the tape for anyone that would listen.  Most adults
grinned, though many of them seemed startled.  The man at the news paper
took the local boys aside and told them that indeed a man named Lee had
lived in the house many years ago.  So, for many years the boys would
believe that is what the voice said.
	Later one of the boys(now grown) asked the news paper man 
about LEE when rekindling the old childhood image, and the news paper
man said "But, LEE is still alive, he just has not lived here for
a long time."  At that time the boy(now man) realized what the voice 
really had said.  What the voice had said was LEAVE.

	     Chi - The Power / Supernatural Occurrences
		   by Daniel Frederick / Neon Chrome ©
  
  In this article I am going to discuss the concept of supernatural and 
 try to explain it in my own way. I would like to hear a response about 
 my ideas and would like to hear your ideas on this subject too. Please 
 note that these ideas are purely my own and no disrespect is intended.
 Chi is not my word, I learned it from many others around the world.

   When I used to think of the word supernatural I envisioned dark 
decay and robed madness, kneeling before the gaping flames of hell 
preparing a fine young female virgin. Bloody knives glittering in 
the luminosity of a megalithic, psychotic, and evil stare of the demon 
Satan himself as he watched his legion surrounded by runes, magic and 
screams of the angels in pain.
   Overdoing it? Maybe. But that is what I thought about, and maybe a
little bit more dealing with cruelty and malevolent actions of magical 
deities and elementals who love to hurt. The supernatural is a topic 
that no one really knows facts about. Each of us will see it differently.
I have had a few encounters in my past. Or so I believe.
   I was born Roman Catholic and believe that if for no other reason,
religion is good because it gives you an environment that is pleasant
and friendly to grow up in. Usually religious people tend to be good
wholesome people. I, however, can't say I honestly believe in one all
powerful God that created every thing. I am not a believer in much at all,
but don't really have a problem with others believing as long as they don't
press their beliefs onto me.
   Is there a demonic Satan some where waiting for God to dispel us from
heaven and send us to hell where Satan waits to thrust suffering and pain
onto us for being evil people? I don't know...it would be nice if a heaven
was there for us to go to when we end with our lives here on this plane
of existence called life on Earth. I don't have my hopes up.
   As far as the supernatural goes I do have a underlying feeling that
there is some sort of unknown that really scares the life out of us
because we don't understand it, and what we don't understand we fear. As
long as I am a morally good person I really am not worried about ending up
in any existence that may cause me great pain once I die.  
   I mentioned that I had some unusual occurrences in my life.  Having talked 
about them with friends and people who I know well I found that most had 
similar things happen to them when they were younger.
   When I was with a good friend in his dark and large basement we saw the
red flaring horns of what we believed was the Devil himself. We were quite
serious and were not fooling around. It seems to me that when you and a
group of friends go in search of the unnatural and some one can't take it 
they tend to disrupt the mood by cracking a joke. When you all are quite
honestly waiting to see what will happen and all involved are serious, then
that is when your collective psychological feeling for something to truly
happen makes it possible for you to see something you may never be able to
explain. If you haven't heard of the word Chi then you should take a moment
to learn what it is.
   Chi is what most martial artists in the world refer to as an energy that
you create about you to perform acts that would otherwise seem somewhat
incredible. I have had the opportunity to train under a couple of styles
of martial arts, ranging from Tae Kwon Do, Judo, to Aikido. Each talked
of how real power came from within not muscle alone. Also I came to
understand the concept and began to focus on it more when I was witness to
my mentor's ability to show and use Chi. A strong board of wood placed in
a metal frame broken while a fist or foot was still inches away. Video tapes
of it showed that no contact was made yet still wood was broken. Many 
scientific studies I have read about show an incredible amount of study 
has gone on concerning this subject. Chi is in a sense a life force that 
can be in a way, a mind over matter force. To go within an inch of one 
instructor gave a shock to my touching hand. Chi then can be used when 
focused on by martial artist, so why not all of us. Because we don't know 
about it? I myself spent many years trying to imitate my instructors in 
their use of Chi. I accomplished it and proved to myself in the most 
convincing way that Chi was real by using it myself. How was I to doubt 
myself if I was to believe in all I knew was the truth (as I know it).
   When you are scared by something lurking around you and you feel it 
breathing down your neck twisting your emotions into hell and playing 
havoc with your mind and you release adrenaline into your body to 
prepare you for any life threatening situation you may encounter, do you 
think that possible you create a force around yourself. Chi surrounds 
you and instead of using it to break a board you use it to create what 
your mind sees. If you really let your imagination get away from you it 
could be lethal. Now imagine that there are six of you all experiencing 
the same phenomenon, your collective Chi builds up surrounding all of 
you in a state of pure fear. This collective force lets an even more 
prominent force occur before all of your eyes. If you sat together in 
a circle around a chair and focused on it in such a state of incredible 
fear that sparked your inner self and all of you desired this chair to 
rise, would it. Why not? What besides fear will cause you to form such a 
powerful force of your Chi? The supernatural would only be you then, not 
the power of some Satan. Then again possibly this Chi is present with us, 
and Demons too are out there co-existing in our sense of reality or 
non-reality...waiting for us to contact them so they may fill our 
dominion along with theirs. Then these monsters would be able to cause 
what looks like magic too. Even more powerful than we can if they 
should happen to understand what we don't. The unknown/known cannot be 
feared. Only controlled like everything else we as humans learn about.
   I do hope that if we all fully understood forces like Chi then we would 
be able to control ourselves and it, not just it. We understand how to 
build and create nuclear weapons, but I have no desire to play in the 
radioactive dust of my parent's ashes because we cannot control ourselves 
along with controlling nuclear weapons. Some do understand in a limited 
way what Chi is and what can be done with the human psyche and mind. It 
is a powerful force, most likely the mind is the most powerful thing of 
all. Some have learned how to control aspects of these forces, weather 
they give meaning and credit to themselves, some powerful demon or God 
himself, it is still limited yet incredible to those who possess no 
control over these forces at all.
   I would wager that the psychic person, the magic user, and those like
the martial artist, all use the same power. Each person would have their
own battery of Chi. Each persons would vary in strength and be channeled
in different directions. Some would understand Chi in the form of magic
while others would better understand it in the form of their own psyche or
mind powers.
   I offer the idea that the power of Chi is a force of nature that can
be controlled by single individuals and groups in many ways, all powerful.
In manipulation or fear. To be used or used by. I would like to hear your
views on this and all the above subjects. Magic, psychogenics, Chi, and 
the Supernatural.

   The editors hope that I.C.S. is a great departure from anything that 
has utilized this format before. It is not a literary 'zine, but we want 
to emphasize creative writing and imagination. Ideally, we would like to 
use fiction, poetry, and truthful accounts all without bias. It is not a 
news 'zine, but we hope to include what news that our electronic medium 
allows to be timewise and relevant to our readers. And lastly, this is 
not a computer and networking 'zine, although those are topics that we 
intend to focus on as well; it is an attempt to use the power and 
efficiency provided by those tools to communicate ideas and provoke 
thought in as many people as we can possibly reach.
   In order that I.C.S. be available to the maximum number of 
subscribers, we are forced to go without many of the aids conventional 
print has at its disposal: fancy type, spectacular graphics, and pictures.
There are ways to use imagination to partially overcome this, and we are 
slowly learning. We also realize that there are many others out there 
who have a great deal more experience with the electrozine and we would 
be grateful to any who might help us along with their ideas.
   Reading through the first issue, we hope that your impression of our 
effort is a favorable one. I.C.S. is likely to change a great deal from 
issue to issue early on as we learn more about what we are doing. It may 
seem rough now... it certainly does to us... but the editors ferverently 
hope we can make up for in enthusiasm what we lack in experience. With 
luck I.C.S. will survive, grow, and eventually deliver a high quality, 
highly respected product that we can be proud to have taken part in.
   I.C.S. is our attempt to contribute to the future.

	ICS would like to hear from you.  We accept flames, comments, 
submitions, editorials, corrections, and just about anything else you 
wish to send us.  For your safety use these guidelines when sending us
anything.  #1.) We will use things sent to us when we think the would be
appropriate for the goal of the issue coming out.  So, if you send us
something that you DO NOT want us to use in the electrozine, then put
the words NOT A SUBMITION in the subject of the mail you send us.

NOTICE!!: The submitions will be used as space allows.  We would like 
to keep the Electrozine under 100K(or two-hundred 512 byte blocks).
