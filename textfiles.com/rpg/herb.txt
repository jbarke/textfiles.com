                              INTRODUCTION

               "Anything green that grew out of the mould
             Was an excellent herb to our fathers of old."
                                                        -Rudyard Kipling

Welcome to the fourth edition of "The Guide to Herbs for RPGs", the
second edition of this guide to be distributed by e-mail and across the
Internet. Herbs have been a staple of fantasy literature for many years. 
Striders use of Athelas in "The Lord of the Rings" to cure Frodo, and
Polgara's herb lore in "The Belgariad" and "The Mallorean" are two
examples that come to mind. The first edition of this guide was written
in response to a request by one of my players for more detailed use of
the Herbalism proficiency than that supplied in the core AD&D rules, and 
also to provide a general system which can be converted to other rules
systems fairly easily. This was in 1990 or 1991 and that edition was
nothing more than an adaptation of the herbs contained in Alexander
Scott's Maelstrom RPG adapted to AD&D rules, a description of each herb, 
the chance of finding it, its preparation time, and its cost. This guide 
was quite useful, though several problems were found with it. The guide
was used for a few years and my printed copy (done on a Commodore 64 and 
a 9 pin printer) became covered in pen and pencil additions and
clarifications. In early 1995 I began GMing a new campaign and I decided 
to rewrite my herbal on my new 486. This second edition contained the
same herbs as the first edition but with the addition of clearer
descriptions, the addition of the Locale in which each herb could be
found, and an Ability Check roll required to use each herb successfully. 
This herbal was much more useful than the previous one. In mid 1995, I
gained net access for the first time, and discovered the phenomena of
NetBooks, and unofficial supplements to various role playing games. I
downloaded these and began to use them in my games. As a student I can
not afford to buy all the commercially produced supplements for use in
my games, and so these unofficial (and free!) supplements were a gift
from the Gods. In December 1995 and January of this year (1996), I
revised my Herbal once again, incorporating herbs from the RPG
Middle-Earth Role Playing (MERP), and on returning to University at the
start of March, subscribed to the ADND-L e-mail list, and offered the
Herbal to the inhabitants of that list. I received over 300 requests for 
the Herbal, and was informed that there was interest in Herbalism on the 
REALMS mailing list. I subscribed to this list as well, and offered the
Herbal once again. I received more requests from this list. I have
received e-mail (both praise and criticism) from many of the people who
are using my herbal, and this has encouraged me to put together a new
revised edition. In particular, special mention must go to Druann
Pagliasotti whose assistance in compiling this new edition has been
considerable. Druann has contributed new herbs, as well as sending me a
list of suggested clarifications, and amendments to over forty herbs
that I had designed.  This edition includes herbs that other people have 
added to my rules, and new herbs that I have developed. It also includes 
more detailed physical descriptions of some of the herbs from previous
editions where I have been able to find them. I welcome the
contributions I have received to this guide, but as always all
responsibility for any errors and discrepancies is mine and mine alone.
I welcome contributions, criticisms and comment on my guide, and will
try to incorporate these in any future editions of the guide. Some
people may have noticed that the title of the guide has changed from
"The AD&D Guide to Herbs" to "The Guide to Herbs for RPGs". This
occurred because of advice that the original title was not compatible
with the guides status as unofficial. Please feel free to distribute
this guide in unedited form in any format that you desire. I only ask
that my contribution and that of other people is acknowledged and that
the guide is distributed free of charge.

NOTE: In my guide I have used the term "Autumn" instead of  "Fall" to
describe the seasons between Summer and Winter. I have also used the
correct Australian English spelling for words. I have altered
contributions received from other people for the sake of consistency. I
have received e-mail criticising me for this, saying "you should use the 
American conventions, because most AD&D players are American." (By the
way, this was not intended as a flame, but was part of some useful
constructive criticism.) I have been taught English as it is spoken and
written in my native country, and I will write and speak in that way.
There are several reasons for this. 
1) If I was attempting to write for a specific country, I would use 
their own conventions. I am not. I am writing this guide for everyone 
who requests it. I received requests for the last edition of this guide 
from the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Spain, 
France, Belgium, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, 
Argentina, Chile and Zaire and possibly from other countries as well. 
2) If I decided to write this guide in `correct' English, I would be 
faced with the problem of what is `correct'. Is it American English, 
that of the largest English speaking country on Earth or British 
English, the source of the language. 
3) I believe that the differences in English from country to country are 
so minor that all English speaking people on Earth will be able to read 
my guide with no problems.

I should note here that this herbal is not `accurate' in terms of the
real use of herbs in our world. This is because my skills in Herbalism
are very limited. I am not a professional herbalist just someone with an 
interest in the topic (especially from a gaming point of view). I have
endeavoured to be as accurate as possible in terms of descriptions, but
sometimes I am trying to describe a herb after seeing a black and white
drawing. I have tried to be accurate in terms of naming the herbs, but
some herbs have many different names. Bilberry for example is also known 
as Huckleberry, Whortleberry, Hurtleberry, Whin-berry, Wimberry, Black
heart, and Hurts. I have also ascribed to some herbs powers that do not
exist in the real world. For example there is no herb that bestows
infravision on a person in our world (as least I assume there isn't!)
but such herbs do exist in the guide. This is because the guide has been 
written for a fantasy game, and I felt that the powers ascribed to these 
herbs in legend and tradition could actually exist in fantasy worlds. I
would also like to apologise for the fact that some of the herbs
contained within have no physical descriptions. This is because I just
can't find any. If anyone feels that I have made mistakes in identifying 
herbs, or their curative properties, they should feel free to contact
me, either by e-mail or by mail.

For anyone who wants to find accurate books on Herbalism and its real
life applications, please refer to the books in the reference section.

                         HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE

This guide was written in order to allow a more detailed method of using 
the Herbalism Non Weapon Proficiency than that provided in the PHB. It
may be used only by characters with the Herbalism proficiency. The
description of each herb contains the following information:

NAME:           This is what the herb is called. In brackets after each 
                name is the name of the person who developed the herb 
                for the guide, and the source of the herb if applicable. 
Available:      This is the time of year when the herb is available, and 
                the percentage chance for a person who searches for the 
                herb for one day finding it. 
Locale:         This describes the region in which the herb can be found. 
Preparation:    This describes how long a herb needs to be prepared 
                before it can be used. 
Cost:           The cost before the / is the cost of the herb in raw 
                form. The cost after the / is the cost of buying the 
                herb ready to use. 
Uses:           The number of uses indicates how much of the herb can be 
                found at any one time. 
Ability Check:  The ability check is the value that must be rolled under 
                on a d20 for the use of the herb to be successful. If 
                the ability check is listed as `?' it means that the 
                herb may or may not have the powers attributed to it. If 
                the ability check is listed as `-' then no ability check 
                is needed for success. The GM should decide what effects 
                these herbs have if any. 
Description:    This section describes what the herb can do.

The GM who uses or allows this guide in their games should examine it
carefully before use, and remove or modify any herbs that they wish.
This is particularly true for those herbs that have quite major powers.

It will be noted that very few poisons are listed in this guide. This is 
for two reasons. 
1. I believe that a Herbalist should not use their art for nefarious 
purposes. 
2. I believe that allowing players access to too many poisons can 
severely effect game balance.

Any GM who wishes to have detailed poisons in their games is referred to 
the "Netbook: Poisons of the Realm", (author unknown to me) which I find 
to be excellent for the purpose.

It should also be noted that I have tried not to include herbs that
could be classed as "Drugs" with the connotation of illicit use. This is 
because I do not wish to be seen to be supporting illicit drug use.
Having said that, for anyone who wishes to use drugs in their games, I
refer them to "The AD&D Guide to Drugs" written by Desmond Reid which
has excellent rules on all aspects of drug use including addiction and
its effects. The drugs contained within it could be converted to my
system fairly easily.

ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS A GUIDE FOR GAME PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES, USE ANY OF THE HERBS CONTAINED IN THIS GUIDE FOR ANY REAL 
LIFE PURPOSE.

                      Shaun Hately, 1st July, 1996

NOTE ON THE USE OF THE AD&D "LOCATE ANIMALS OR PLANTS" SPELL:
Players with access to the 1st level Priest Spell "Locate Animals or
Plants" will try to use it to locate specific herbs. If this occurs I
would suggest that the Dungeon Master uses the percentage score given
under "Available" in each herbs description as the chance that the herb
will be detected each round, subject to the local environment and
season. However I would remind the GM that according to the PHB, the
results of this spell are always determined by the GM. If the GM does
not want the herb to be found, it should not be found.

                       NOTES ON THE USE OF HERBS
                 by Druann Pagliasotti and Shaun Hately

Unless otherwise indicated in text, any cut herbs and preparations of
herbs only have a shelf life of 3d6 weeks. Dried herbs have a shelf life 
of 1d4 years if kept in a sealed container away from moisture (but not
all of these herbs can be used in a dried form).  Potions, on the other
hand, have an indefinite lifespan - which is why they're more expensive
yet still desirable.

A rule of thumb for purchasing is that the chance of purchasing an herb
in a large city WITHIN its native region is equal to the chance of
finding it in the wild (and the price will remain the same); the chance
of purchasing an herb in a large city OUTSIDE of its native region is
equal to half the chance of finding it in the wild (and the price will
be half again as much); and the chance of purchasing an herb in a large
city OPPOSITE of its native region (eg., artic vs. desert) is one
quarter of the chance of finding it in the wild (and the price will be
doubled or tripled).

The GM of an individual campaign must rule on the use of this guide.
They must decide whether or not they wish it to be used at all, and they 
must modify it to fit their campaign. Some of the herbs contained in
this guide are extremely powerful, and if they are overused they will
unbalance the game. The prices given for herbs are only guidelines and
must be treated with common sense. In plague years, for example the cost 
of herbs that protect against plague will increase incredibly. And if
the characters stumble into a herbalist while supporting a friend who is 
on the verge of death from snakebite, the herbalist may decide to charge 
well above the going rate. Some apothecarists are nothing but charlatans 
and will sell anything while saying it is a wondrous herb.

Once again, I must point out that this guide is intended for use in
games only. Do not use it as a guide to herbal medication. Many plants
are highly poisonous and experimenting can be extremely dangerous.

in clear water for one day. It should then be drunk as a cure for
fevers, especially those caused by diseases such as malaria. It does not 
cure the cause of the fever but merely brings it under control within
2d6 hours. The ash tree is sacred to worshipers of Thor, who use its
wood to make spears. The wood of the ash tree could possibly be used as
an essential item in the manufacture of magical spears. Ash leaves
should be boiled in water and drunk as a cure for the poison of viper
bites (cures poison in 2d6 turns, any damage already incurred remains).
The ash tree has ash grey bark, and black buds. Its flowers have no
petals.

                        and death's shadow grows
                          and all lights pass,
                      come athelas! come athelas!
                           Life to the dying
                       In the King's hand lying!"

brewed into a dark, sweet-smelling beverage, traditionally with a goat's 
milk base. Like kaffe or black tea, caffar can be used to delay sleep,

sensitive; psionicists' skills are greatly enhanced and even the
unpsyighted are more sensitive to nuances in the environment and in
others' manners, sometimes even to the point of detecting "auras" around 
certain objects. (Raises Wisdom [Intuition] by 1 for every 2 cups
imbibed, to maximum of 19. Drinking 3-4 cups in one day causes jumpiness 
that increases as more is imbibed.  Those who drink 5 or more cups in

                 REAL WORLD HERBS AND FANTASTIC HERBS

The following table identifies which herbs exist in this world, and 
which only exist in fantasy worlds. I have made every effort to be 
accurate, but it is possible that the table may contain some errors. The 
herbs that do exist in our world do not necessarily have the powers 
ascribed to them in this guide.
