                         Part One  A-L

 This  document reveals most of the poisons, toxins, venoms,  and
acids  that have been discovered in use around the  realms.   The
terms are described below.  Note that some of these are real-life
poisons and should NOT EVER be considered for anything other than
game use.  I REPEAT, THIS DOCUMENT IS ONLY FOR A GAME!!

Definitions:

  Poison:     Some  form  of  harmful substance  that  exists  in
              naturally with no alterations from PC's (Other than
              the collecting of said poison)

  Toxin:      A damaging substance that does NOT occur in nature.
              A toxin must be produced manualy by an alchemist or
              assassin.

  Mixture:    A  substance that is used as a poison, but must  be
              made and produced by magic.

  Venom, Spit:A sdamaging substance that is produced ONLY  within
              the  glands of an animal.  Generally thought to  be
              the  strongest  of the poison types, but  also  the
              hardest to collect.

  Acid:       A corrosive substance that either exists in nature,
              is  produced by an animal gland, or is produced  by
              someone.   Causes  damage  upon  contact  but   can
              usually be washed off upon initial contact to  stop
              damage, unlike a poison.

                      - Forms of Poisons -

Ingestive:    This form of poison is the most common.  To  effect
              a creature, it must first ingest the poison.   This
              means that the creature must eat the poison one way
              or another.  Getting a poison in this form is of  a
              normal cost.

Insinuative:  This form of poison will effect a creature just  by
              getting  it  into it's blood stream.  This  is  the
              form  of  poison that is used on weapons.  (And  in
              specialized  weapons as a Dagger of  Venom).   This
              form of poison costs an extra 50% to create (Cost *
              1.5)

Contact:      This form of poison will effect a creature just  by
              coming in contact with the poison.  This is one  of
              the most expensive and most dangerous forms.   Many
              a  user has slain themselves through  carelessness.
              This form of poison costs 300% normal cost (Cost  *
              3)   NOTE:  This form of poison is easily  bypassed
              by  thick  gloves.  However  I  have  heard  of  an
              assassin which mixes acid and poison for just  that
              sort of case.

Gas:          This  form  of poison is very dangerous.   It  will
              effect  EVERYTHING within range.  You will have  to
              pay a pretty gold piece for any alchemist to add an
              oxidizing  agent to a poison and it's EXPENSIVE  to
              ask someone to risk their life for that.  This form
              costs 1000% normal costs (Cost * 100).  The  normal
              effect  is  a sealed vial which  when  broken  will
              produce a 20' x 20' x 20' cloud of gas.

Antidotes:    Antidotes  are available if a sample of the  poison
              is  made  available.   The  antidote  usually  cost
              120%   of  the  purchace  price  of   the   poison.
              Antidotes  take approximately one week  to  create,
              and  must  be administered within 2 rounds  of  the
              toxification to be effective.  If no sample of  the
              toxin  is  availible, one cam be distilled  from  a
              blood  sample, but that will take  approximately  a
              month and a 1,000 extra gold (by then it's too late
              anyway).

-----------------------------------------------------------------
                        - NOTE TO GM'S -

      These  poison (toxins...etc...) have not been assigned  any
     price  or  dosage for effect (with few  exceptions).   These
     things are  up to you.  This also goes for  availability  of
     these and antidotes (Note thought that there are a few  that
     have no known antidote!)  The only other note I should  make
     is  to  keep these in control.  To many can really  throw  a
     game  out  of  balance.  For assassins  to  study  these,  I
     usually  allow them on type (Poison, Toxin,  venom...etc...)
     to  learn and they may learn how to use, collect,  produce..
     it  from 5th level on.  For each level afterwards, they  may
     learn one more from that type of poison.

     MANY OF THESE ARE TAKEN FROM OTHER BOOKS AND ARE ACKNOLEDGED
     HERE.  MY THANKS TO THE AUTHORS FOR ALLOWING ME TO MAKE  THE
     GAME  MORE INTERESTING.  I'M SORRY IF I'VE MISPELLED ANY  OF
     THE NAMES!

                              divided  by  the number  of  active

Assassin's venom              A standard poison for assassins, it
                              does  1d20 per day of brewing  time
                              (an average dose does 1d20 to 4d20,
                              but cannot exceed 10d20 in damage).
                              It  costs 500 gold per day to  make
                              and if a 5,000 gold piece  gemstone
                              is powdered and added to the  brew,

                              (1d4+3) segments

Belpren                       This  is a luminescent blue  acidic
                              substance  does 1-12 (1d12)  damage
                              instantly  upon skin  and  internal
                              tissues    (No   save).     Further
                              applications  of Belpren  will  not
                              cause   any  more  damage  to   the
                              effected area, but the damage given
                              above  is for a roughly  hand-sized
                              area   of   exposure;   for    each
                              additional  area  exposed,  add  an
                              additional   1-12  (1d12)   damage.
                              However, no damage will be taken if
                              used   internally   (As   Ingestive
                              poison),   it   will   cause   only
                              immediate     and      invoulentary
                              vomiting.  Belpren will not corrode
                              metal,  nor will it harm  cloth  or
                              cured   leather.   It   dries   and
                              becomes ineffective in but a single
                              round when exposed to open air,  so
                              it cannot be used as a blade venom.
                              Belpren is neutralized by lamp oil.
                              Belpren   is   effecting   on   all

                              (-2  to hit, damage, 30% chance  of
                              spell  failure) after 20 points  of
                              damage  are  taken;   Disorentation
                              increases  in  steps of  10  points
                              (Additional -1 to hit, damage,  +5%
                              to  spell  failure).   This  effect
                              wears off 1 - 3 turns after  poison
                              has run it's course.  Save for half

                              of  the eyes to go black  (although
                              this does not effect vision in  any
                              way) and causes 1-8 (1d8) damage to
                              the neural system immediately.   No
                              pain is felt by the victim however,
                              for  Jeteye  kills  all  pain   and
                              tactile  sensation for a period  of
                              9-16  (1d8+8)  rounds  (the  "black

                              duration).   Jeteye  is   sometimes
                              used voluntarily before torture  or
                              immediately  after battle  injuries

                              the  stomach (Effective in  any  of

                              will do no more damage,  regardless

                              damage.  This resistance lasts  for
                              3-25   (3d8)  days.   This  is   an
                              ingestive  poison only.   Save  for

Lisssteeen                    A  liquid  that  when  found   will
                              always be labeled:
                                         "HERE NOW"

                              This yellow liquid has no smell but
                              it  will make your mouth water,  it
                              tastes  spicy  hot  (like   tabasco
                              sauce),   and   works   only   when
                              swallowed   (Only  ingestive   type
                              poison).   There is no  discernable
                              effect to or on any creature within
                              100  feet of the imbiber.   BUT  to
                              any  creature  more than  100  feet
                              from  the  imbiber  will  hear  the
                              voice  of  the imbiber due  to  the
                              "effect"  on  the  imbiber's  vocal
                              coards.   This  fluid  causes   the
                              imbiber's  vocal cords to  transmit
                              on  a  ultrasonic  as  well  as   a
                              subsonic level making all within  a
                              mile  of  them  hear  the  imbiber.
                              This  sound  level  permiates   ALL
                              planes  and dimensions  also.   Any
                              diety's name which is spoken has  a
                              50%   bonus  of  hearing  and   any
                              creature within 300 feet CANNOT  be
                              surprised under any  circumstances!

                              added to gravy or dark sauces,  but

                              flavor.   Every  drop  of  Varrakas

                              bypasses  the digestive  system  by
                              masquerading  as a  nutrient).   It
