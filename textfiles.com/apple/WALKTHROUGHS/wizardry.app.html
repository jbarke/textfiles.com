Mage Spells

Level 1 Mage Spells

     Spell Name  HALITO           HALITO causes a flame ball about the size of
    Translation  Little Fire      a baseball to strike a monster, inflicting
     Spell Type  Combat           from one to eight hit points of damage.
 Area of Effect  1 Monster

     Spell Name  MOGREF           MOGREF reduces the spell-caster's Armor
    Translation  Body Iron        Class by two points.  The effect lasts for
     Spell Type  Combat           the entire encounter.
 Area of Effect  Caster

     Spell Name  KATINO           KATINO causes all of the members in a
    Translation  Bad Air          group to fall asleep.  KATINO only affects
     Spell Type  Combat           normal animal or humanoid monsters, and the
 Area of Effect  1 Group          duration of its effect is inversely
                                  proportional to the power of the monster.
                                  Sleeping monsters are easier to hit, and
                                  successful strikes do double damage!

     Spell Name  DUMAPIC          DUMAPIC grants you insight into your party's
    Translation  Clarity          position in the Maze; the exact displacement
     Spell Type  Peacetime        from the staris leading to th castle
 Area of Effect  Entire Party     (vertically, North, and East), and the
                                  direction you are facing.

Level 2 Mage Spells

     Spell Name  DILTO            DILTO causes one group of monsters to be
    Translation  Darkness         enveloped in darkness, which reduces their
     Spell Type  Combat           ability to defend themselves against your
 Area of Effect  1 Group          attacks.

     Spell Name  SOPIC            SOPIC causes the spell-caster to become
    Translation  Glass            transparent.  This makes him or her harder
     Spell Type  Combat           to see; thus the caster's AC is reduced by
 Area of Effect  Caster           four points during the encounter.

Level 3 Mage Spells

     Spell Name  MAHALITO         MAHALITO causes a fiery explosion to erupt
    Translation  Big Fire         amid a monster group, doing four to twenty
     Spell Type  Combat           four hit points of damage.
 Area of Effect  1 Group

     Spell Name  MOLITO           MOLITO causes sparks to fly about and damage
    Translation  Spark Storm      about half the monsters in a group, to the
     Spell Type  Combat           tune of three to eighteen hit points.  The
 Area of Effect  1 Group          monsters have no choice of avoiding the
                                  sparks.
Level 4 Mage Spells

     Spell Name  MORLIS           MORLIS causes one group of monsters to fear
    Translation  Fear             the party greatly.  The effects are the same
     Spell Type  Combat           as a double-strength DILTO spell.
 Area of Effect  1 Group

     Spell Name  DALTO            DALTO is similar to MAHALITO except that
    Translation  Blizzard Blast   extreme cold replaces flames.  In this case,
     Spell Type  Combat           anywhere from six to 36 points of damage
 Area of Effect  1 Group          are inflicted.

     Spell Name  LAHALITO         LAHALITO is an industrial-strength MAHALITO.
    Translation  Fire Storm       Quite the flamethrower for those extra-
     Spell Type  Combat           irksome monsters.  LAHALITO will inflict
 Area of Effect  1 Group          from six to 36 points of damage.

Level 5 Mage Spells

     Spell Name  MAMORLIS         MAMORLIS is similar to MORLIS, in that it
    Translation  Terror           causes monsters to be gripped with by an
     Spell Type  Combat           incapacitating fear of the party.  The
 Area of Effect  All monsters     difference is that all monster groups are
                                  affected by it.

     Spell Name  MAKANITO         Any air-breathing monsters less than eighth
    Translation  Deadly Air       level are killed outright by this spell.
     Spell Type  Combat           More potent creatures are not as impressed
 Area of Effect  All monsters     by it.

     Spell Name  MADALTO          MADALTO is a supercooled DALTO, causing eight
    Translation  Frost King       to 64 hit points of damage.  All monsters
     Spell Type  Combat           suffer from it, to some degree.

Level 6 Mage Spells

     Spell Name  LAKANITO         All monsters in the group subjected to this
    Translation  Suffocation      spell die.  But if they do not depend on air,
     Spell Type  Combat           or if they're especially magic-resistant,
 Area of Effect  1 Group          you're in trouble.

     Spell Name  ZILWAN           This spell will destroy any one monster of
    Translation  Dispell          the Undead variety.
     Spell Type  Combat
 Area of Effect  1 Monster

     Spell Name  MASOPIC          This spell duplicates the "transparency"
    Translation  Big Glass        effect of SOPIC for the whole party.  Each
     Spell Type  Combat           party member's AC is reduced by four points
 Area of Effect  Entire Party     for the duration of the encounter.

     Spell Name  HAMAN            This spell is indeed terrible, and may
    Translation  Beg & Grovel     backfire on the caster.  Thirteenth (or
     Spell Type  Combat           higher) level characters may cast it, but
 Area of Effect  Unknown          doing so will drain them of one level of
                                  experience.  The effects of HAMAN are strange
                                  and wonderful.
Level 7 Mage Spells

     Spell Name  MALOR            This spell's effects depend on the
    Translation  Teleport         situation in which the party finds itself
     Spell Type  Any Time         when it is cast.  MALOR will teleport from
 Area of Effect  Entire Party     one location to another.

More about MALOR
    When used in the heat of battle, MALOR's effects are random, although you
will not be teleported away from the current Maze level.  Casting it at other
times, when there is more chance for concentration, affords you the opportunity
to move the party anywhere in the maze. BE WARNED, however, that if you teleport
yourself outside the Maze, or into an area that is solid rock, you will all be
LOST FOREVER, so this spell is to be used with great caution. Combat use of
MALOR will not "rock" you.

     Spell Name  MAHAMAN          The same restrictions apply to this spell as
    Translation  Beseech          do to HAMAN.  However, the range of possible
     Spell Type  Combat           effects is even greater.  This spell is
 Area of Effect  Unknown          generally used only when there is no other
                                  hope for survival.

     Spell Name  TILTOWAIT        The effect of this spell may be likened to
    Translation  KERR-BLAAMMM!!!  that of a small, well-contained, nuclear
     Spell Type  Combat           fusion explosion.  Luckily, the party is
 Area of Effect  All monsters     shielded from its effects.  The monsters are
                                  not so lucky.  This spell will wreak from ten
                                  to 100 hit points worth of havoc.

Level 1 Priest Spells

ME: What did the SCC guy teach you about?
AN: Various things, and cleared up a lot of misconceptions about ANI and how
    it actually works, auto-verify, things like that, which I really didn't
    know the answers to. He had it as sort of a hobby as well, he was on some
