TOP OF THE PAGE   To know me personally, is to know how fanatical I can be
"""""""""""""""   when it comes to Digital Publishing.  Convincing people
that there are definite positive advantages to publishing electronically
has been a long and frustrating battle, and unfortunately, the battle is
far from over.  However, that doesn't slow me down any, it just makes me a
little more fanatical about spreading the word.  Lately, I have been
reading articles about Digital Publishing in high-profile publications like
Time, Newsweek and the New York Times so clearly, all is not lost.  Digital
Publishing is finally starting to find its place in the computing world.

     Along these lines, the Digital Publishing Association (a group of
folks who are just as fanatical as I am :) are coming out with their second
annual Digital Quill awards competition.  Take a look...



 >>> DPA ANNOUNCES SECOND ANNUAL "DIGITAL QUILL" AWARDS COMPETITION <<<
 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Birmingham, Alabama - July 19, 1993: The Digital Publishing Association,
the first and only trade organization for the electronic publishing
industry, announced the Second Annual "Digital Quill" Awards for Excellence
in Electronic Publishing.

     In making the announcement, Ron Albright, founder and director of the
DPA, defined "electronic publishing" as the publication of literature and
graphic material in computer-readable, digital format; specifically,
materials created on computer and distributed in digital format for other
to read through their computers.  According to Albright, the term
encompasses "everything from plain ASCII text, which can be read on any
computer, to complex, hypertext publications that rely on machine-specific
programs to view and navigate."

     The Quill Award competition is open to all authors and publishers,
regardless of DPA membership status. The only requirement is that the
materials submitted for judging must have been previously published in
electronic format. Submitted materials must either have been uploaded to an
online system or distributed on disk for reading by computer as digital
materials. In clarifying, Albright said "materials that were simply created
on computer - most writers use those for composition anyway - do not meet
the criteria of having been electronically published for reading and are
ineligible."

Award Categories
""""""""""""""""

     o Serial Publication - a weekly, monthly or otherwise regularly-
       scheduled publication that has been issued for at least 6 months (or
       at least 3 editions) available prior to July, 1993. This category
       will include both fiction and non-fiction magazines and newsletters.

     o New Serial Publication - a weekly, monthly or otherwise regularly-
       scheduled publication that has been issued for less than 6 months
       but has been published at least for two issues. This category will
       include both fiction and non-fiction magazines and newsletters and
       is proposed to recognize and encourage new issues.

     o Fiction Book - an original (eliminating reprints of the "classics"
       in digital format - who among us can hope to compete with a digital
       edition of Shakespeare's classics?) electronically published novel.
       Length: 50,000 words, minimum.

     o Non-Fiction Book - an original non-fiction book in digital format.
       Length: 35,000 words minimum.

     o Short Story - a single original story appearing either alone or as
       part of an anthology or magazine and published in digital format.
       This category shall exclude reprints of stories originally published
       in a paper publication. Length: 1000 words, minimum.

     o Non-fiction article - a single originally article appearing either
       alone or as part of a magazine and published in digital format. This
       category shall exclude reprints of articles originally published in
       paper.  Length: 1500 words, minimum.

     o Publishing software - a software program (Shareware or traditionally
       marketed) designed for publishing text and/or graphics and
       facilitating their distribution and viewing.  Nominations will be
       accepted from users as well as original authors.

     o Miscellaneous - this niche will encompass poetry, graphic
       collections, comics, and other publications outside the standard
       categories.

PRIZES   A certificate, suitable for framing, will be awarded to first,
""""""   second, third winners in each category. In cases where the number
and/or quality of submissions warrants, Certificates of Merit will also be
awarded. Additional prizes, including cash awards, are under consideration.
If available, these will be announced in the future.

DEADLINES   Submissions will be accepted from original authors or from the
"""""""""   editors of a publication in which the submitted material
appeared.  Submissions must be made in digital format (via modem or on
disk) to any of the "electronic addresses" listed below.  Deadline for

Apple II Corner
"""""""""""""""
By Douglas Cuff
       [D.CUFF]



BIRTHS, DEATHS, AND MARRIAGES   With all the activity in the Apple II world
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   this month, I began to realize that the
reports of its demise have, once again, been greatly exaggerated.  Trying
to come to grips with it all in this, my first month as editor, I think I
have an idea why it's called a social WHIRL.  If it gets any more frantic,
it'll be a social whirlpool.

     I'd like to outline for you some of the recent births, deaths, and
marriages, but it's not an easy task.  Sometimes what seem to be births are
rebirths or adoptions, or even marriages.  Sometimes the deaths are
divorces.  Oh, to heck with the semantic classification, it's all pretty
exciting!  You'll find the details within, but here are a few items to
pique your interest:

BIRTHS:   With a title like SHAREWARE SOLUTIONS II, it might sound like
"""""""   a rebirth, but it's a bona fide newcomer all right.  Shareware
champion Joe Kohn has started publishing his own Apple II newsletter, and
the title, he cautions, was chosen for name recognition and may be
misleading, because it deals with much more than shareware.  The premiere
issue arrived this month, and I have a feeling that Joe Kohn will be
passing around a few metaphorical cigars in the first few issues.
Something to celebrate indeed!

     There are other new arrivals, or rather, shortly-to-arrivals:  TypeSet
from WestCode Software, Addressed for Success from Econ Technologies, and
Bottom Line from Quality Computers.  Look for the details in this month's
HEY MISTER POSTMAN!


DEATHS:   As those who read the past month's issue of GEnieLamp A2 know,
"""""""   INCIDER/A+ folded with their July issue.  This month, the Apple
II world was shocked and saddened to hear that the June issue of A2-CENTRAL
was the last PAPER issue.  A2-CENTRAL will continue to publish a disk
magazine... so perhaps it's not a death, just a divorce.  It's not good
news, though.


MARRIAGES:   The most exciting news in quite a while comes from a marriage
""""""""""   between Quality Computers and AppleWorks guru Randy Brandt:
The WORKS 4.0, code-named Quadriga, will be an AppleWorks add-on that is
rumoured to be the equivalent of an upgrade.  At least, it will require
that you have AppleWorks 3.0 to take advantage of it.  It's not really
AppleWorks 4.0, but the point is, AppleWorks isn't going to be allowed to
die!

     Now if only we had an AppleWorks GS guru to work on The GaSWORKS 2.0,
code-named Lazarus....  (NOTE:  This is NOT a rumour, it's just me being
silly.)

     The social event of the season has just concluded -- the Fifth Annual
A2-Central Summer Reunion -- and the reports are still rolling in.  Look
for more coverage of this great marriage of minds next issue.  Let's hope
it's not to be the last, as rumor predicts.

     One other entry for the marriages column:  GEnieLamp A2 and me.  I
mentioned briefly above that this is my first month as editor.  I felt I'd
better slip that in quietly so that loyal readers wouldn't goggle at the
new name in front of them and figure they'd missed an issue.  At the same
time, I didn't want to begin with this minor news, since there was so much
major news to deal with.

     Darrel Raines has moved from editor to a position that will allow him
to write more articles for GEnieLamp A2.  What's more, Phil Shapiro is
looking to hand his co-editor position over to someone else, now that he'll
be producing his own disk-based publication, Helium Balloons, and staff
writer Mel Fowler has been off nursing a sick modem.  Mel's back now,
though, I hasten to add!

     All these changes at GEnieLamp A2 mean two things:

     First, because Darrel and I were forced to change horses in midstream,
the A2 Profile interview had to be abandoned this month.  It'll be back,
never fear!  This month, time was just too short.

     Second, if you've been thinking that you'd like to write for GEnieLamp
A2, then now is the time to step forward.  If you haven't been thinking
about writing for GEnieLamp A2, then now would be a good time to start!
Contact me via GEnie mail (my address is D.CUFF).

     I'm just as pleased as I can be to be the new editor of GEnieLamp A2.
I've been an Apple II user for some time:  I started using an Apple ][+
late in 1982, and upgraded to an Apple IIe just a few months later, thanks
to an extraordinarily obliging dealer, and got my first IIGS in late 1986.
The point I'm laboriously trying to make is that I love the li'l devil too!
You are not alone.

     I've been absent from GEnie for a number of months, and it was
GEnieLamp that led me back.  I started downloading GEnieLamp A2 from a
local BBS and was so impressed that I reactivated my dormant GEnie account,
unable to bear missing out on GEnie any more.

     By way of a tribute to outgoing editor Darrel Raines, allow me to
quote from a message I read on another network recently, not long before I
signed on as editor, posted by shareware author John L. Graham:   "One
bright spot in the Apple II world is GEnie's online magazine, GEnie Lamp."
The credit for this belongs to Darrel, and to Jim Couch, editor of
GEnieLamp A2Pro, but I hope to be able to do as well... with your help.

                               [*][*][*]

 
     Before we turn you over to your regularly scheduled GEnieLamp, Darrel
has a few words of his own to add:

     As you've read, we have a new editor this month.  It is with regret
that I give up that position for this fine publication.  However,
circumstances dictate that someone else carry on.  I am sure that Doug will
lead us on to bigger and better things in the world of electronic
publishing.  I wish him well as editor of GEnieLamp A2.

     I want to take a moment and tell each of you that I have enjoyed
bringing this newsletter to you on a monthly basis.  I learned a lot of
things along the way.  I hope that as I was learning the ropes, we were
giving you the information you needed to use your computer and the GEnie
Information System as efficiently as possible.  It has always been my
intent to make this newsletter one of the best sources of information for
the Apple II community.  If we have succeeded in meeting any of these needs
for even a few users, then I consider the effort to have been worthwhile.

     One of my major objectives was always this:  I did not want to print a
whole newsletter of old or recycled information.  This presented a real
challenge to us since a large part of the newsletter content is excerpts
from the A2 bulletin board system.  The way that we handled this was to
insist on printing a large number of original articles that had never
appeared in any other format before:  the monthly columns such my
editorials, our game reviews, Phil's "think" piece, profile interviews, the
shareware and upload reviews, and all of our one-time feature articles.  I
sincerely hope that you found some nugget of new information in each issue.

     I will still be writing for GEnieLamp.  My major focus will be on
gaming, but I will be touching on other topics.  -Darrel Raines

WHAT KIND OF MAC IS THAT?   I understand price wars more than you know.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   and I know the IIgs-//e are not the main reason
for Apples woes, but it saddens me when such a good product is dumped.
(especially when I bought one).

    BTW all the people who dump on the gs, I had a friend over the other
day that is currently programming Macs, it took me 15 min to convince him
that my computer is an Apple II!
                (EW.CHRISTIAN, CAT5, TOP2, MSG:211/M645;1)


VIDEO OVERLAY CARD   I have some pretty basic questions about the
""""""""""""""""""   capabilities of the VOC...
     At my local user group, the IIGS is connected, of course, to the GS's
RGB monitor, and also connected to a standard TV via the Composite Out
jack.  During demos, people have a real hard time seeing the images on the
RGB because it's so small, and on the TV because it's so blurry.

     This is presenting a real problem to the group, and we want to resolve
it.  It seems we don't have enough money to buy some type of overhead
projector ($1500 or so), so it's been suggested that we get a VOC. People
seem to believe that connecting a VOC will improve the resolution of a
standard composite TV monitor.

     Will it, or is this a myth? If it will, can you supply some details? A
club member has said that he saw a deal for an inexpensive large screen
monitor that had 600 line resolution (whatever that means) and thought
that by connecting a VOC to that monitor, that we'd get crystal clear
resolution.  Would we?

     In a similar vein, the TV I own has both analog and digital RGB
inputs, but being in another part of the house, I've never connected it to
the GS.  Theoretically, if we were to buy a large screen TV with analog RGB
inputs, it should be similar in resolution to the GS RGB. In reality, is
it? I bought that TV 7-8 years ago, and the club member who is looking at
monitors said that he hasn't run across one with an analog RGB. Are those
still made, or is he just running into TV salespeople ignorance?
                   (J.KOHN, CAT26, TOP13, MSG:29/M645;1)

>>>>>   The VOC does marginally increase the quality of the IIGS composite
"""""   video output (key word: marginally), but you have to have a pretty
good monitor to notice the difference.

     A better option is, as you said, to use a TV/monitor that has RGB

WILL be considerably sharper than the composite signal.  (Also, the fact
that your TV even HAS RGB inputs tells me that it's a good set and should
show up the difference quite nicely.)

     There are electronic reasons for the difference in picture quality,
which I won't go into here, but they're also the reason that we always use
the S- Video inputs on OUR big show monitor whenever possible.  The more

APPLE IIE STILL IN PRODUCTION   ][n general, the way IIe’s are bought
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   now (i.e. by schools), they will get large
orders in batches.  So they don't get a large stock of IIe’s sitting around
in warehouses, and they don't run the assembly line continuously.  When
they get a few large orders, they fire up the assembly line, make 'em, and
ship 'em right out.  They may have enough sitting around to fill one or two
orders at a time, so they'd send those out while firing up the production
line.
    ___
     |he bottom line is that the IIe _IS_ still in production, though not
continuously, and they are NOT just trying to unload warehouses full of
them. And consider this:  Has Apple EVER had some kind of consumer
promotion just to unload warehouses full of computers?  No.  You've never
seen it with any Mac models, you didn't see it with the IIc, IIc+, or IIgs,
and you're not going to see it with the IIe.  What they usually do with
excess inventory is sell them to a remarketer, like Sun or Shreve (or Price
Club, in the case of the Mac PowerBook 100).  They have also:  Bulldozed
them into a hole in the ground (Lisa/Mac XL), and sold them at a major
discount to Apple EMPLOYEES (Mac IIsi, I believe).

of this, ProTerm can have a total pathname length of 63 characters.

     Let's say your drive is names "MyRealCoolStuff", ProTerm is in a

directory in ProTerm3.1 called "MyNewestStuff", This path now is...

/MyRealCoolStuff/Communications/Proterm3.1/MyNewestStuff/

     That is 57 characters!! Your data files only have 6 characters left
before ProDOS 8 has heartburn!!!

you use verbose directory names...

IIGS ROM HISTORY
""""""""""""""""
     1. The original, ROM 0 MB was released with all the parts
        needed to install it in a //e as a conversion unit. The
        conversion kit itself was a backplane for the //e, plus
        the MB, plus a mouse (although I think that was
        optional).

     2. The ROM 01 MB was released as a NON-convertible board
        (possibly in the initial runs, possibly later). This
        board had neither the dual power supply plugs, nor any of
        the other internal plugs for //e equipment.

     3. The original (convertible) design was mandated as THE
        ONLY service replacement for defective ROM 01 GS
        motherboards. This created a problem, eventually, since
        non-convertible boards were coming in for replacements.
        The non-convertible boards were upgraded to
        convertibility in the process of refurbishing, and put
        into the repair stock. I believe that this all happened
        before the ROM 03 was released.

     4. Whether the ROM 03 MBs ever shipped without the internal
        ports I don't know. Certainly the ROM 03s were never
        intended to be put in a //e case, but I know of no reason
        why they COULDN'T be, and, come to think of it, I know of
        at least one that WAS. :)

     I know that it makes no sense to have designed and built boards that
HAD the circuitry on them to accept the plugs, but no plugs. Nevertheless,
that was done, and there are lots and lots of them out there. Whether your
board  has them or not is entirely dependent on when it was produced. If
the MB on your machine has ever been replaced it almost certainly does have
the plugs. MY MB has been replaced, but it was taken out of a brand new
machine from the dealers stock because I needed it RIGHT NOW, and the
dealer likes me. :) (And was out of stock on GS replacement boards.)

SPEAK WELL OF THE DEAD   I talked to someone once who was not an Apple II
""""""""""""""""""""""   user and never was, but who made an interesting
observation about the machine.  He said that when it came out, the Mac
still wasn't gaining a very significant foothold, and that it looked to a
lot of people in the industry like Apple was hedging its bets with the
IIgs, that in making it so very Mac-like they were positioning it to take
over for the Mac if the Mac really did fail.

     And the original Mac was going to be based on the 6502.  It was only
near the end of the design stage that they switched to the 68000.

     All that means nothing now, but it's interesting to think about.

PROTERM MACRO TRACKS FREE HOURS   Since GEnie has changed its rate
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   structure and we now get 4 hrs free for
our $ 8.95 monthly fee, I decided to write a macro to track hours and costs
for the current month (to make sure I don't let a month go by without using
all 4 of those hours  :)

     To use this macro, you need to set the "Log Calls to Disk" parm in the
dialing system(s) you are using to call GEnie.  If your dial system name
starts with anything other than "GEnie", you will need to modify the search
string used in the line after the INput statement.  I have 2 dial systems
to log into GEnie, one is called "GEnie-Automatic" and the other
"GEnie-Manual", so I just check the first 5 bytes of each log record for
"GEnie".

     The macro gets the current month, then reads through the PT3.LOG file
looking for records that match the dial system name and the current month.
Hours and minutes are accumulated for each record that matches.  GEnie's
rate is then applied.  If the total time is 4 hours or less, a cost of $
8.95 is displayed.  When the time goes over 4 hours, the $3 per hour rate
is applied and added to the $ 8.95.  Current cost, hours, minutes and the
month are displayed.

     I've hooked this macro up to the @@2 label in ProTerm 3.1's
PT3.GLOBALS file, so that the macro is invoked when I click on the time in
the menu bar while at the main menu.  In PT3.Globals, find label @@2 and do
the following:

WHY CAN'T JOHNNY LEARN?   A little while back, I did a review in inCider/A+
"""""""""""""""""""""""   of an astronomy program for kids. When I first
ran the program, some of the data about the planets of our solar system
didn't look quite right to me. So, I looked at some recent material I had
about the Voyager missions that listed the number of moons each planet had.
I compared that to the number of moons that the program said each planet
had, and realized that the facts and figures presented in the software was
incorrect. I called the company to report this, and they said something
like "but, we've been selling the program for two years, and no one else
has said anything to us before". I was adamant, and demanded that if they
were going to sell "educational" software, they’d better fix their program.
After much haggling, I got them to consult an Almanac, and eventually they
released a free update to the software.

GIVE UP ON APPLE?   I have come to the conclusion that it is time to give
"""""""""""""""""   up on Apple and switch to DOS.  I have used DOS at work
for the past 6 years, but continued to remain a loyal Apple II user at
home.  I have used the Apple II since 1984. But recent developments have
made me decide to switch.  It has become increasingly difficult to get
any type of support on hardware or  r software for the Apple II, so this is
good-bye for me.  (D.CAVANAUGH, CAT5, TOP8,MSG:1/M645;1)

>>>>>   Apple computer is not the evil corporation that everyone makes it
"""""   out to be. In fact, they are one of the best companies in the
industry.

     Try this experiment.  Call a Packard Bell retailer and tell them you
have a Legend II computer.  You don't know much about it but a friend told
you that it needs a new motherboard.  They will refer you to Packard Bell's
800 number.  You will need to send it to a service center.  The service
center will probably not be able to fix it with the legend II motherboard.
Instead you will receive a notice that says "Not economical to repair."
That's a catch-all phrase that I used to see on even some Tandy computers
and other equipment when I worked at a Radio Shack.

     What the hell.....Try it out with a few brands.  You'll be surprised
at the outcome.

     Now, Call an Apple dealer and give them the same story.  They will
offer to look at it, and if the motherboard is in need of replacement, they
will do it.  "Not economical to repair" is not in the vocabulary of most
good authorized service centers.  They will repair it.

     CompUSA is a really bad example.  They won't even give it a chance.
But smaller non-corporate dealers will do it.

     Another example of the much finer (yeah right!) computer companies is
Leading Edge.  If you purchased an early 286 machine, you will discover that
there were problems with the ROM bios.  This ROM is only found in the
Leading Edge (pre-Diawoo days).  Will they fix it?  No!  Can you get a ROM 0
GS updated to a ROM 01?  Absolutely!

     If you are unsatisfied with the policy of an Apple dealer regarding
the servicing, be aware of this fact.  If you're to be an authorized Apple
repair center, you M U S T  service any and all Apple equipment made.  The
Apple //GS, //e, and //c logic boards are R E Q I R E D stock items.  All
Apple parts can be ordered overnight, provided Apple has them in stock.  A
backorder on an Apple service part is rare.   As a former Apple technician,
the only time Apple had a problem with stock of repair parts was when they
moved the entire operation to Texas.  I'm sure they've got it straightened
out by now.

     Final exercise:  Tell them your Lisa screen is burned out and ask how
much for the part and labor if it truly is.  Answer.... About $250.00

WestCode Announces TypeSet:
A TrueType Productivity Package For Your Apple IIGS
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     San Diego, California: WestCode Software, Inc. is pleased to announce
TypeSet, a powerful three-part TrueType font management and productivity
package for the Apple IIGS. TypeSet provides Apple IIGS users with several
essential tools currently missing from their TrueType toolbox, including: a
What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) Font menu, font sets, and font
reporting. WestCode spokesman Tony Gentile said, "If you're working with
TrueType fonts on the Apple IIGS, you need TypeSet."

     TypeSet is a IIGS New Desk Accessory (NDA) which easily installs on a
startup disk. The first and most dramatic TypeSet feature is its ability to
display fonts in their own typeface inside the Font menu of IIGS desktop
software. Apple IIGS users will now be able to see what a font looks like
before selecting it. This feature works with most popular desktop
applications, such as: AppleWorks GS, BeagleWrite GS, and Platinum Paint.
Users may specify whether the font names appear in 10 or 12 pt.

     TypeSet also provides users with another powerful feature: font
management. Font management is accomplished by allowing users to define
font Sets composed of specific user selected fonts. Grouping fonts into
different Sets allows the user to control the number of fonts in their Font
menu, making font selection easier and reducing clutter. Users may define
as many sets with as few or as many fonts as desired in each set.

     Finally, the last point in TypeSet's triad of features is its ability
to generate reports. TypeSet allows users to generate reports in any of
four layouts, including: All Characters, Keystroke Equivalents, Line
Showings, and Various Sizes. These reports are perfect for building a user’s
personal font catalog. The reports generated with TypeSet can be output to
both the screen and printer. WestCode CEO Rob Renstrom said, "TypeSet
continues WestCode's tradition of bringing state-of- the-art,
Macintosh-like technology to the Apple IIGS."

     TypeSet is the latest outstanding software product by the programming
team of Steven Disbrow and Joe Wankerl of EGO Systems, publishers of GS+
Magazine and authors of the ever popular EGOed Desk Accessory text editor.

     Founded in 1990, WestCode Software has earned a reputation for
excellence through the success of their innovative InWords OCR program, as
well as the award-winning Pointless TrueType interpreter program. With
additional products forthcoming and a steadfast commitment to improving
existing products, WestCode continues to fulfill its pledge to provide
high-quality, low-priced software.

     System requirements for TypeSet are an Apple IIGS with 1.25 megabytes
of RAM, GS/OS System 5.0.4 or later, and Pointless 2.0 or later.

     TypeSet will be available in late July, at a suggested retail price of
$49.95.

ECON Announces Addressed For Success GS/OS Desktop Address Database
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     Oviedo, FL - Econ Technologies Inc. announced the addition of a new
member to its line of software.  "Addressed For Success" is a GS/OS,
desktop-based database management package that elegantly manages large
lists of names and addresses.  It includes powerful features not found in
any other software package, wrapped up in a friendly, easy-to-use
interface.

     Addressed For Success supports a variety of methods to create an
address database. Addresses can be entered using the built-in editor or
imported directly from AppleWorks Classic database files.  Additionally,
any database that has been saved as a standard ASCII file can also be
imported.

     Filling a void in the Apple IIgs' productivity software, Addressed
For Success allows one to easily print addresses, graphics, and postal
barcodes on any kind of label form, including envelopes.  One can instantly
view exactly how labels or envelopes will appear before printing,
eliminating guesswork.  Addressed For Success contains features found
nowhere else, such as:  automatic return address generation, a 65,000-
character memo field, selection by example, bulk sortings, full support of
the clipboard, and automatic PostNet barcode generation.  Addressed For
Success also comes with over 30 predefined label templates supporting
virtually every standard Avery label format.

     Addressed For Success is the first GSOS-based program to come as a
result of the recent expansion of ECON Technologies' programming staff.  It
is a testament to the firm commitment ECON has made to bring useful,
productivity-oriented software to the Apple IIgs.

     Requirements:  Apple IIgs with 1Mb of memory and System Software 6.0
or greater. Compatible with The Manager from Seven Hills.

     Addressed For Success will be available this summer with a suggested
retail price of $49.95.

PMPUNZIP UPATE RELEASED   Parkhurst Micro Products is proud to announce
"""""""""""""""""""""""   the latest revision of its popular PMPUnzip
utility:  PMPUnzip Version 2.0!  Version 2.0 is now compatible with the new
PKZIP Version 2.0x archive files and works better with multitasking
software and text files.

FEATURES
''''''''
  o    Access to all files stored in ZIP archives, including files
       that were stored, shrunk, reduced, imploded, or deflated
       (NEW!!).
  o    Access to full pathnames stored in ZIP archives, including any
       subdirectories in the archive.
  o    All ZIP file extraction routines are written in 65816 assembly
       language for speed.
  o    Multiple ZIP files may be open at one time.
  o    Multiple info windows may be brought up on any of the files in
       any open archive.  Info windows contain more information on the
       file, including modification date and time, compressed size,
       and more.
  o    Archive comments!  Using a proprietary PC character font,
       PMPUnzip will display in the IBM character set any comment
       included in the ZIP archive.  Many PC bulletin boards will have
       information screens included inside ZIP files using PC graphic
       characters.  These will show up as they were meant to look.
  o    The last modified time and date (as stored with the ZIP
       archive) will be retained in the extracted file.
  o    NEW!!  Version 2.0 will now automatically convert text files
       created on other platforms to the Apple's CR-delimited text
       file format.
  o    NEW!!  PMPUnzip now has an option for extracting files in the
       background.  This allows you to use NDAs while extracting, and
       allows you to use other applications at the same time when
       operating under multitasking software, such as The Manager(tm)
       by Seven Hills Software.
  o    NEW!!  PMPUnzip now keeps preferences so you can customize how
       you want the program to work.
  o    Disk functions.  PMPUnzip includes the ability to format or
       erase a volume and change the attributes on a file.
  o    MessageCenter aware!  PMPUnzip will allow opening of ZIP files
       from The Finder(tm) (or any Finder-like program that passes
       file information between applications via the MessageCenter) by
       either double-clicking on the file's icon or by choosing the
       file and selecting "Open" from the Finder's "File" menu. You
       can also have multiple ZIP files selected when you select
       "Open" and PMPUnzip will open them all.
  o    Appleshare  and other FST compatible.  Since PMPUnzip uses
       GS/OS and the toolbox for all of its disk and file access, it
       will just as easily open a ZIP archive on an HFS or Appleshare
       volume as it will a ProDOS  volume.
  o    Single-disk friendly.  PMPUnzip was designed to work with
       single-disk users.  You will be prompted for which disk to
       insert during an extraction.
  o    Most text used in PMPUnzip is stored as resources and can be
       modified by any resource editor.  For instance, text can be
       translated into different languages without having to write an
       entirely different version of the program.

SHAREWARE   PMPUnzip 2.0 is SHAREWARE.  The shareware fee is only $15.
'''''''''   For this, you will get a diskette with the most current
version of PMPUnzip 2.x, free updates in the mail for Version 2.x, and a
20% discount on ANSITerm Version 2.0.  If  you have sent in your shareware
fee for a previous version of PMPUnzip (1.0,  1.0.1, or 1.0.2), the
shareware fee for Version 2.0 is only $5.

APPLEWORKS 4.0?  ALMOST!   The WORKS 4.0 is a major enhancement for
""""""""""""""""""""""""   AppleWorks 3.0 that adds vast amounts of
functionality to the popular integrated package.  Programmed by Randy
Brandt and Dan Verkade and published by Quality Computers, The WORKS 4.0 is

every module are incorporated.  I'll be posting a complete list tomorrow.
(There are so many new features that I simply refuse to even try to list
them all without the sheet that Randy sent us close by.  <g>)

     For the record, Claris is not involved in producing this upgrade.
What you will get when you buy The WORKS 4.0 is a disk that modifies your
AW3 disk, sort of like a TimeOut application on steroids.  YOU MUST have
AW3 to use The WORKS 4.0.

     Also for the record, the code-name for this product (before it was
announced) was Quadriga.  The product's real name is The WORKS 4.0.  (This
disclaimer is included to make Apple's lawyers happy.  I've heard some
rumblings that "Quadriga" and "Quadra" sound too much alike for their peace
of mind.  <grin>)

     The WORKS 4.0 will be released on October 1, 1993 and will sell for
$79.95.  For a limited time, you can pre-order it and save $10.  Call

""""""""""""""""""""   history. Highlights included the opening session
with reluctant introducer Pam Wagner ("I've never done this before."),
followed by a five-minute video made entirely with HyperStudio and produced
by a French filmmaker (whose name escapes me for the moment). Not to be
outdone by the film, Roger appeared and "bantered" for about 45 minutes (as
only Roger can), only to be upstaged in the end by the appearance of
HyperMascot Addy (who did an admirable job of holding her water in front of
a crowd of over 200 attendees, as did Roger ;). The eighteen 50-minute
sessions ranged from Mac HS topics on video spigot and HyperLogo to IIGS
topics on HS in special education, SimpleScripting and animation. A teacher
from southern Cal even brought a few of her students to show of their stack
making skills. Presenters included Jim Hirsch, Sheldon Davids, Mike
Westerfield and Bill Lynn. The day was capped off by a 3-hour beach party
(that I was unable to attend, unfortunately, so use your imagination). Day 2
is dawning as I write so I'll continue my report later today.

>>>>>   That's it! The First Annual HyperStudio Festival is now a part of
"""""  history and one that I will not soon forget. The more than 200
people in attendance represented a unique cross-section of HyperStudio
users who shared at least one thing in common... a love for HyperStudio. It
isn't often that I present at a conference where everyone is already
familiar with HS and can share their own unique insights and experience. It
was truly a worthwhile event and I, for one, hope that RWP begins making
plans for next year's event as soon as possible.

     Fifteen hour-long sessions were completed today with topics that
included using LaserDisc players effectively, how to make money selling
your stacks, using Lego with HyperStudio (neat!), HyperStudio and special
education, and Stupid Button Tricks (my session). I was completely taken by
surprise with the attendance at the Stupid Button Tricks session (standing
room only) and I have to admit that I may be a bit stigmatized by SBT since
I was being referred to as "that stupid button guy" (just don't forget the
"button" part, OK?). The day was capped off with an "Ask The Experts" panel
that consisted of Roger, Mike O'Keefe, Mike Westerfield, Dave Cochran, and
Bill Lynn (that stupid button guy). Some "hot" news from RW included the
fact that a PC version of HyperStudio may well be a reality by this time
next year, and I was successful in getting Mike O'Keefe to admit that the
animation procedures in the IIGS version will look a lot more like those in
the Mac version soon (i.e. much easier to use, like importing clip art). In
fact, don't be surprised if you see HS 4.0 in the not too distant future
(once the Mac version is filled out a bit more). Look for stand-alone
versions of Mike Westerfield's "HyperLogo" for the IIGS and the Mac very
soon (perhaps the IIGS version at KansasFest? Perhaps.).

     Look for the HyperStudio Mac Preview Disk (available soon from RWP)
which is a fully-implemented version of HyperStudio for the Mac that will
run for 30 days.

     Well, I'm completely exhausted from jet lag, my ingrown toenail is
killing me and I've got to get up at 4:30am to get on a plane :(.  Watch
for info on HyperFest for next year and don't miss it. I know I won't.

WHERE'S RELIEFWARE?   Hi there. Just thought I'd post a request for you
"""""""""""""""""""   BBS'ers and user's group librarians. I have just
moved from Clarksville, TN to Midland, GA (courtesy of the U. S. Army), and
therefore need to let the world know that ReliefWare Central has moved.
Revised versions of OneArm Battle, Plunder!, and Milestones 2000 are in the
library, along with a small file (RW.UPDATER) that edits the resources on
Version 1.5 of these games to show the new address and a version number of
1.5.1.
     If you have these games (or know someone who does), please help me
update the version. The forwarding order on the Puyallup address  has
expired, and the Clarksville forwarding order will die similarly soon.
However, ReliefWare is still alive. Thank you!

     If you run a BBS, or know someone who does, puh-leeeze replace your

convert your 1.5's to 1.5.1's. (And it's a quick DL...)   :)

     The game play is identical; it just changes the address. And no, I
doubt I'll update them again (the Army PROMISES they won't move me for

SHAREWARE SOLUTIONS II SPECIAL OFFERS   In the initial press release that
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   I'd posted (and re-posted) about
Shareware Solutions II, I'd made mention that Shareware Solutions II
subscribers would be able to take advantage of some money saving offers.

     Among some of the offers that will be made to subscribers in Issue #1
is a nearly 50% discount on software from Seven Hills, and the low cost
($15) availability of System 6.0.1 via the mail.

     Through the arrangements I have made, these special offers are only
open to subscribers.

     In addition to the deals, Issue #1 will include a guided tour of Apple
Expo West, a technical article offering step-by-step instructions on how to
use your IIGS custom icons with System 6 (even when an application contains
its own rIcon bundle that generally takes precedence), an article entitled
Modem Madness that includes info that any modem user should enjoy (with a
special offer for GEnie users and soon-to-be GEnie users), a continuation
of inCider's Grapevine hint/tips/rumor column, a listing of dozens of
freeware and shareware disks available through the mail, a first look at
System 6.0.1, and an update on what next to expect from Burger Bill
Heineman.

     It's not too late to subscribe. The first issue should be in the mail
no later than July 15, 1993, barring no further delays. Apple II Forever!

THE (FINANCIAL) BOTTOM LINE   Allow me to leak a rumor...  Sometime later
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   this month Quality Computers will be
releasing a program called Bottom Line.  It is a nice compromise between
YMM and Quicken.  It provides budgeting capabilities along with checkbook
management (something Quicken added to their IBM and Mac versions, but not
the Apple II).  But it is not as comprehensive as YMM.  It is easy to set
up and use and allows you to use the same Quicken checks you've always
used.  It also includes a nifty export utility that allows you to dump your
account data into an AppleWorks spreadsheet.

     It does have one drawback however... it is not hard drive installable.
It runs on either 3.5" or 5.25" disk and runs quickly.  It is an 8-bit
program so it runs on a //e as well as a IIGS.

     Sound interesting?

BUT SHE *LIKES* THE IIGS...   Hey all you big hearted GSers!  I wonder if
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   any one out there can help me out.
I have a old friend who is disabled and is not able to leave her home.  She
has been kinda living her life vicariously through the use of a IIgs from
my work that I was able to loan her.  Though she was given a Mac SE with
one meg, two 800k drives, and a Imagewriter I printer, she was never very
happy with it, but she has fallen in love with the IIgs <Thanks to Joe Kohn
and all his Shareware Solutions!>  It has really made a difference in her
whole outlook on life!

     Unfortunately, the IIgs has to go back to work, and we have been
trying to locate her a IIgs.  She is on a extremely limited income, and I
am a California Public School Teacher <which should tell you something
about my financial status>  She can't afford much.

     She definitely wants a IIgs, and would be willing to swap the Mac and
printer for a basic IIgs set up. <I have another ImageWriter I she can
have.>.

     Anyone out there have any suggestions or can offer any help?  We can
provide you documentation that she really is disabled so you will know this
is not a scam, and can probably swing some sort of receipt through social
services for any donations that you could write off.

     It is amazing the difference the "dead" Apple II has made in her life.
I really want to get her a system of her own.

STAR TREK RSOUNDS   Now that I'm in the publishing business, I really had
"""""""""""""""""   wanted an exclusive "scoop", but after seeing all the
posts here recently about Star Trek sound files, I decided to give up my
scoop, and save you all a lot of trouble.

     A Mr. Bill Moore of Tennessee contacted Sound Source Unlimited last
year and asked about availability of Trek sounds for the GS. After being
greeted with the usual questions (which Mac is a IIGS?), and supplying all
the correct answers, Mr. Moore was contracted to convert to IIGS format,
the following:  Star Trek (Classic) Volume 1, Star Trek: The Next
Generation Volumes 1 and 2, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, and 2001: A Space
Odyssey.

     According to Mr. Moore: "Pricing is unavailable because no release
date has been set;  I will recommend an SRP of about $39.95 each, meaning
places like LRO and Quality will sell it for about $25 to $30 each."

     So, just sit tight. They're coming.

     Apple hasn't been involved in actively supporting the Apple II since
1986 when the last real engineering was done to solidify the IIGS design.
Ever since then, Apple's given very little attention to the Apple II
series, compared to the Macintosh.  The time to give up on Apple Computer
was about eight years ago.

     However, Apple computer is not what makes Apple II computing what it
is. It's the developers and third-party companies that have made the Apple
II a venerable and productive machine today.  We're just lucky that we
continue to get new operating system software every now and then from
Apple.  I don't feel that the future of the Apple II even depends on that.

     Don't give up on the Apple II developers, which is what you're really
doing. If the remaining Apple II users replaced their machines with PCs, it
wouldn't hurt Apple at all, they wouldn't even notice.  Unfortunately, the
migration would completely decimate the Apple II developers who would
surely suffer from it.

                           WARNING:
 
   GEnie PC Aladdin has been determined to be harmful to your health and
   mental stability.  House mice routinely placed in front of a keyboard
   and given Aladdin and a GEnie account have demonstrated wildly aberrant
   behavior after short terms of exposure, ranging from increasing the
   sizes of their paw signatures to 10x times the normal size, to engaging
   in cage-to-cage flame wars regarding the issue of illegal use of
   mousetraps in protected rug-covered areas, something which has already
   been demonstrated to be deleterious to the living conditions and
   environmental stability of the rodent population in the western
   hemisphere.  Withdrawal symptoms after termination of the test sessions
   have also ranged from simple begging to have their modems returned to
   their little computer hutches to finding patch lines running from their
   cages to the closest RJ-11, connected to stolen Hayes Personal Modems,
   which were themselves connected to the gerbil cages (the gerbils were
   more than happy to provide power with little generators hooked up to the
   running hoops in exchange for a share in the lettuce rations).
 
   In one particular case, lightning struck near the testing facility on a
   dark wednesday night, opening a large tear in the time/space continuum,
   from which an uncontrollable Aladdin Lag emerged, destroying every water
   bottle in sight.  The rodents were found the next day with their little
   tongues sticking out, completely dehydrated.  Small notes folded in the
   shape of tiny paper airplanes were found near the fish tank, begging for
   Evian resupplies.
 
   Secondary effects were also observed on the cat population in the
   testing facility.  As far as we can tell from the evidence (notes of
   paper with the numbers 1 through 9, with the numerals 1 through 8
   crossed out, and small vials of pure catnip next to their bodies) they
   were completely freaked out at the sight of mice playing Air Warrior, at
   which point they decided to do away with their entire supply of
   reincarnations.

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
By Phil Shapiro
   [P.SHAPIRO1]



                      >>> EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES <<<
                      """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

IS IT POSSIBLE?   Online communications have already changed many facets
"""""""""""""""   of workplace interactions.  Much has been said already
about how electronic mail flattens out a corporation's management
hierarchy.  Online communications might change the hiring process in a
similarly revolutionary fashion.  Is it possible that "online interviews"
will totally supplant face-to-face hiring interviews?

     The purpose of any employment interview is for employees and
employers to find out as much as possible about each other.  Both sides are
trying to minimize the risks of getting involved in an employment situation
that later proves to be unfulfilling.

     Job interviewing today is flawed only in the respect that it totally
lacks logic.  About the worst possible way of finding out about a human
being (or a company) is to sit down for a casual twenty-minute chat.
Admittedly, you can draw some general conclusions about a person's demeanor
and character by looking them over from head to toe.  But to delve deeper
into a person's character you need to probe further below the superficial
social surface.

     Online communications offers an opportunity for both employers and
employees to do just that.  Instead of sitting down for a twenty-minute
chit-chat, prospective employers and employees can engage in a more
involved, deeper, long-lasting online dialogue.

     Chances are that online communications will dramatically extend the
time-span of the interviewing process.  Prospective employers might court
potential employees by asking them to send e-mail comments and feedback
about goings-on in that particular industry.

     To gain further insight into a person's patterns of thought,
employers might ask to see current writing samples.  But instead of asking
to see just "three recent writing samples," employers can take advantage of
online communications to make more rigorous demands.  It's not too
far-fetched to imagine an information-age employer asking prospective
employees to send everything they have written in the past two years.

     In the situation where the job opportunity involves some measure of
creative talent, an employer might reasonably request a potential employee
to send a variety of writing samples.  Companies such as Microsoft or Apple
might realistically ask interviewees to send five pieces of original
fiction, five poems, five non-fiction articles, and five recent business
letters.  Looking at these combined writings should give employers a
rounded picture of prospective employees.

     On the other side of the coin, potential employees can use online
communications technology to probe deeper into the working of corporations
they're considering working for.  If a corporation is serious about
courting a prospective employee, the corporation should be more willing to
reveal more of itself.

     The resulting courtship might very well last several months, or even
more than a year, before becoming formalized into an employer-employee
relationship.  The employment interviewing process, therefore, will take on
some of the traits of the age-old process whereby two human beings get to
know one another.

     Many advantages would result from this innovation in hiring practices.
Employers would have a very good sense of the character and talents of the
employees they're hiring.  Employees, likewise, would have a better sense
of the company they're going to work for.

     The moral of all this?  Brush up on your dating skills.  You might
need them in courting your next employer.  And forget about polishing up
your resume.  More important to have several dozen writings samples on hand
to send prospective employers.

     In the coming Information Age, the written word will reign supreme.
Those who can best mold raw ideas into sterling sentences will be able to
write their own tickets.

                 >>> GETTING STARTED WITH THE APPLE IIGS <<<
                 """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

BACK TO THE BASICS   This is the beginning of a series in which I plan to
""""""""""""""""""   focus on helping the user who has just acquired his
or her Apple II computer.  This article, and subsequent ones, will assume
that the reader knows NOTHING about their computer beyond how to turn it
on.  I hope that the information will be useful to someone who is not
currently able to use their computer to its fullest, but wants to learn
more.  Reader feedback is welcomed and encouraged, as I am no longer a
beginner myself, and have only a certain dwindling understanding of what
information would be useful to the beginner; understanding what YOU want to
learn more about will make this monthly feature more valuable for all of us.

     I have chosen to start with the Apple IIGS, rather than with the older
versions of the Apple II (the ][, ][+, IIe, and IIc), because I've recently
begun to use this model, and the "beginner" experience for it is most fresh
in my mind.  I plan to turn the discussion eventually to the older models,
but the IIGS is more complicated and I believe it to be a somewhat more
difficult computer on which to get "up to speed".

     Some of you may not own an Apple IIGS, and you wonder whether there
is any reason to make the change.  Some have made the change, but just
can't get the hang of it, and can't really do what they'd like to with it.
This article and the ones to follow should help you out.

     (By the way, in the course of this article I make reference to
"8-bit" and "16-bit" computers.  This relates to the amount of information
that the microprocessor is able to handle at one time.  The models from the
original Apple ][ up through the IIc Plus are 8-bit computers; the Apple
IIGS is a 16-bit computer.  The IIGS can handle up to 8 megabytes of RAM in
a single block; the older Apple II's can only handle 64K bytes of RAM in a
single block, though some programs can use switch-banks of memory to make
use of extra memory.)


FINDING THE RIGHT IIGS FOR YOU   Okay, so you've been thinking for a while
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   about getting one of those Apple IIGS
systems.  You've been envying all those neat features that the IIGS users
are always talking about on the A2 Roundtable on GEnie, or at the Apple
User Group meeting.  Or you feel frustrated that there are just not that
many new applications (besides educational games) being released for your
Apple IIe or IIc.  What steps can you follow to make the move to 16 bits?

     Most of the decision depends (as usual) on how much money you have to
spend.  The ideal Apple IIGS system, fully decked out, may require more
disposable cash than you have sitting around.  That was where I was about
18 months ago, when I first began to seriously consider changing from my
souped-up Apple IIc to a IIGS.  I had gone as far as I could with my IIc.
It had an 8 MHz Zip Chip, a one-meg Apple RAM card, and a Chinook 40 meg
hard drive (the CT-40c, which plugs into the disk port on the back of the
IIc).  This gave me a nice, fast machine, both in terms of speed of disk
access and speed of the programs I ran on it.

     The system that I REALLY wanted was one with 4 megs of memory
(minimum), an RGB color monitor, a fast SCSI card (for a hard disk, and
possibly a tape drive), an accelerator card, one or maybe two Apple 3.5
drives, and one Apple 5.25 drive.  I decided I could stick with my old
reliable ImageWriter I printer for the time being.  But the COST of getting
my ideal IIGS system seemed prohibitive.  I had to try another approach to
achieve my goal.


IT COSTS >>HOW<< MUCH?!   Let's look at the expenses involved in getting
"""""""""""""""""""""""   a IIGS.  You can't buy it from Apple dealers any
more (assuming they even know ABOUT the Apple IIGS), since it was dropped
from the dealer list in December 1992.  There may be a few new systems out
there that you CAN buy from dealers that want to clear out their old
inventory, but most people today will have to look to the resale market.
If you can find someone who wants to sell his or her entire SYSTEM for a
good bundle price, and if you have that much cash available, that is the
best way to go.  You'll have most (if not all) of the pieces you need to
comfortably run the most popular software, and very possibly some of the
IIGS programs you've been drooling over.  But to know if the price someone
is asking for their system is reasonable, you need to know what it costs to
buy the pieces via commercial mail order businesses.

     The most consistently available sources for refurbished Apple II and
IIGS systems are Sun Remarketing in Logan, UT (800-821-3221), and Shreve
Systems in Shreveport, LA (800-227-3971).  Both Sun and Shreve have been
selling Apple computers (usually discontinued or refurbished models) for
some time.  There have been modest changes over time for the prices on
pieces necessary to create a basic Apple IIGS system; here are their prices
as of June 1993:

                                   Sun       Shreve
                                   ---       ------
     Apple IIGS CPU, ROM 01        $449      $349
          with 256K RAM
     Apple RGB Monitor (for IIGS)  $249      $229
     Apple 3.5 Drive               $199      $169
     Apple 5.25 Drive              $139      $169
                                   ----      ----
                                   $1036     $916

     (NOTE:  prices are for used equipment)

     Shreve seems to be the less expensive source of an Apple IIGS basic
system.  I do not know anything about the relative quality of the equipment
available from Shreve compared to Sun.  I DO know that the IIGS CPU that I
ordered from Sun in February 1992 appeared to be a never-used computer; if
it WAS used, it was SO well restored and refurbished that I could not tell
the difference (with the exception that the system disks supplied with the
computer had Sun's label on them).  If you're about to call Sun, however,
you will be out of luck:  They are currently completely out of IIGS
computers as of June 1993, and have a waiting list of about 38 names.
Shreve DOES have them in stock (as of mid-June).  Neither company is
supplying the ROM 03 IIGS, which has 1 meg of memory built-in, instead of
the 256K built into the ROM 01 version.  Also note that the above prices do
not include shipping charges, so allow for that.  There are probably
differences as well in the warranty offered by either company.


MOVIN' ON UP   Now with this set of building blocks, you do have a IIGS
""""""""""""   computer, but you will be VERY limited in what IIGS software
you can use on it.  To have a computer that is capable of running System 6,
the latest version of Apple's powerful 16-bit operating system for the
IIGS, you need a minimum of 2 megabytes of memory to do anything useful.
You can upgrade the memory on this 256K computer most inexpensively at this
time by either buying it used, as with the computer, or new from the major
Apple II mail order houses.  Since there were other items I originally
wanted on my ideal IIGS system, let's price these as well:

               Sequential Systems RAM GS 4 meg $115
               Zip GS Card, 8MHz/16K cache     $173
               RamFAST/SCSI card, 256K cache   $139
               127 meg SCSI hard drive         $304
                                               ----
                                               $731

     (NOTE:  prices are for new equipment)

     These prices were taken from the ad for LRO Computer Sales of
Woodstock, IL (800-275-4576, or 800-ASK-4LRO) in the July issue of inCider.
Very similar prices can be found in the ad for TMS Peripherals of Boca
Raton, FL (800-275-4867, or 800-ASK-4TMS), so shop around.  These items,
along with the cost of the basic system itself, brings the price of my
ideal IIGS complete system to $1650-$1770 (again, excluding shipping
charges).

     These prices were approximately the same when I started to build up my
system last year, though the hard drive, memory, and SCSI card prices were
higher then.  Consequently, I immediately ruled out the idea of getting my
ideal system all at once; I couldn't afford that.  With this information,
however, it did make it easier to determine what systems being sold in
classified ads REALLY should cost.


BUILD A GS ON A BUDGET   It would be best to find a complete system being
""""""""""""""""""""""   sold used by someone who is changing computer
platforms to something else.  That way, not only can you get all the basic
pieces you want, but there may be some nice additional goodies (such as a
hard disk or accelerator).  If you decide that even a used system is not
affordable because you cannot come up with the full price all at once, ask
if the seller is willing to have the payments spread out over several
months.

     If not, then the next best solution is to collect the components one
by one.  You will not necessarily spend LESS over the long run (and you
might possibly spend more), but you will at least be able to get a IIGS and
begin enjoying the benefits of a more powerful computer.

     The most basic, stripped-down Apple IIGS you can get is simply the CPU
(ROM 01 or ROM 03), keyboard, and mouse.  You will then need to add a
monitor and disk drives.  This is where those who are moving up from an
earlier Apple II such as the IIe or IIc will find the going easy.  For a
monitor, you can use the monochrome monitor from your Apple II Plus, IIe,
or IIc.  You will find, however, that a composite color monitor, although
it worked well for graphics, will not display 80-column text clearly.

     For a disk drive, you can usually use the ones from your existing
Apple II.  The disk drives used on the IIc, either the Disk IIc or the
UniDisk 3.5, will plug directly into the disk port on the IIGS.  The older
style Disk ][ drives used on the II Plus and IIe can be used also; you can
just put the same disk card in slot 6 on the IIGS.  You can also buy or
build a converter plug to allow an older style 5.25 drive to plug into the
IIGS disk port.  The only disadvantage to the UniDisk 3.5 on the IIGS is
that it will run slower than an Apple 3.5 drive, due to a different
interleave.  (To get a better explanation of "interleave", see the segment
on advances in disk drives in Part 9 of my Apple II History, in the
February 1993 issue of the A2 GEnieLamp.)  However, the UniDisk 3.5 will
not run any slower than it did on your earlier Apple II, so you haven't
lost anything by going with the slower drive.

     With a ROM 01 IIGS, you now have the equivalent of an Apple IIe that
runs at 2.8 MHz (instead of 1 MHz), and has 256K of memory (instead of the
maximum 128K memory on the IIe or IIc).  If your IIe or II Plus had a
slot-based RAM card, that can be used on a IIGS as a RAMdisk.
(Unfortunately, the memory cards used with the IIe auxiliary slot or with
the IIc memory expansion cannot be used on the IIGS.)  With this
arrangement, you have something that is close to what you had before, and
you can continue to upgrade from there.

     When I was finished with my initial conversion, I had a ROM 01 IIGS,
using my Monitor IIc (the "ET" monitor).  For disk storage, I used my
UniDisk 3.5, a non-Apple brand 5.25 drive, and my Chinook CT-40c hard disk,
all of which plugged into the disk port on the IIGS just as it had on the
IIc.  Because I REALLY needed more memory, I added a C.V.Tech memory card,
and installed 3 megs of chips on it, giving me a total of 3.25 megs of
usable RAM -- almost three times as much memory as my 1.125 meg IIc.  I had
lost the speed of the 8 MHz Zip Chip (which I noticed most when using
certain AppleWorks macros), but I finally had an Apple IIGS.  It was a
start.

     For those readers who plan to move beyond this start with their IIGS,
what you add at this point depends on what you want to do with your new
computer.  Are you still going to use lots of 8-bit applications?  Adding
more memory may help with certain programs (AppleWorks, Publish-It!, and
ProTerm are examples that come to mind).  Want to avoid the floppy shuffle?
Getting a hard disk will ease your way.  Graphics or games?  If you want to
get into 16-bit quality, you will eventually need to get that color RGB
monitor.  Music?  A sound board will let you plug your IIGS into stereo
sound.  And any of these things will enhance the GS operating system,
GS/OS, which can be used when you pass the 1 meg barrier:  older versions
like v5.0.4 will run with 1 meg; newer versions like System 6.0 or 6.0.1
will require 2 megs or more to run well.

     In the next edition of Polishing Green Apples, I would like to take a
closer look at what you can do with a REALLY bare-bones IIGS system (i.e.,
256K RAM and one 5.25 drive), and what it takes to continue upgrading it
into a good, productive system.

     (If you have any comments or questions that you would like to have
addressed in a future Polishing Green Apples column, please send stamped,
self-addressed E-mail to S.WEYHRICH.  If you cannot find a place to put a
stamp on your E-mail, then just send it anyway.)

ShadowWrite NDA (v1.3)

          Filename        :  SHADOW1.3.BXY
          Library Area    :  8
          Program Number  :  20915

          Program Type    :  NDA Full-featured Word Processor 
          Author          :  Andre Horstmann [A.HORSTMANN]
          Version Reviewed:  1.3
          File Type       :  FREEWARE!

                               [*][*][*]


ABOUT THE PROGRAM   We have all heard of the great watches and chocolate
"""""""""""""""""   that come from Switzerland.  However, did you know
that one of the best Apple IIGS programmers is also from Switzerland?: the
genius behind Bright Software, Andre Horstmann.  Bright Software has
produced several outstanding products including two games, Gate and
Spacefox, both available through distributors here in the United States.

     One of Andre Horstmann's best efforts for the Apple IIGS is a program
called ShadowWrite, a full-featured word processor in the form of a New
Desk Accessory (NDA).  What a useful idea; I don't know what I would do
without one!  It is great for opening text files or reading the documents
for new programs you have just downloaded.  You can have a disk or folder
directory opened on one half the screen and ShadowWrite open on the other
half.  I have used this method to write entries into my database of disk
catalogs.

     The ShadowWrite NDA has evolved through the past year or so and
several versions of the program have been uploaded to the A2 library here
on GEnie.  This review, however, is of version 1.3, the latest to be
uploaded, which among other new features includes a bright, shiny, new-blue
ruler, which can be shown or hidden with Apple-E.

     Generally speaking, here are some features of this latest version of
ShadowWrite that I especially like:

     Not only can you launch ShadowWrite as you would any NDA, via the
Apple menu, but you can specify which file types you want loaded into
ShadowWrite when you double-click on a file from the Finder.  ShadowWrite's
Preferences option lets you choose to load (by Finder double-clicking) any
or all of Teach, text, source code, or AppleWorks classic.  Whatever your
Preferences selection, you can still open all four types "manually", when
using ShadowWrite's Open command.

     Preferences will also allow you to change the default font for new
documents and the default font for opening text files, where you might
prefer a mono-spaced font.

     Although only one ruler can be assigned to a document, this new ruler
makes setting tabs, margins, and indentation easy.  Also, if you open an
AppleWorks document, the tabs are automatically set to the AppleWorks
defaults.  Setting justification is just as easy as clicking your mouse
when the ruler is displayed, or as fast as using the key-equivalents.

     There are key-equivalents for nearly everything, with different
key-equivalents available WITHIN key-equivalents:  Apple-H, for example,
selects "Save As" from the files menu, at which point you can press Apple-E
to save your document as a Teach file, Apple-T for a text file, and Apple-S
for Source.  Key-equivalents are available for setting justification, font
style, and much more.

     The fast cursor movement keys are also nice to have, such as
Option-Left/Right arrows for beginning and end of line.  Apple-Up/Down
arrows for page up/page down, and my favorite Apple-1 through Apple-9 to
scroll to relative positions in the document, as with AppleWorks.

     Stability is another strong point.  With all the beta testing that
this program has gone through, this latest version is stable and bug-free.
I have not experienced a single hang or system crash while using
ShadowWrite 1.3.

     Find/Replace has the ability to find returns and replace them with
spaces, which is especially useful when you download a text file and want
to put it into a word processor.  No more hunting for stray returns!

     Then there's the ability to Clear Highbits.  I have often run across
problems when the person writing a text file uses the Merlin text editor.
Merlin is great for writing source code, but not text files.  If you try to
read such a file with ShadowWrite all you get is inverted question marks.
Try using Clear Highbits and the text will come out perfect... well, at
least readable.

     The ShadowWrite documentation is clear and concise in describing
all the features, menus, and key-equivalents available in the program.

     Memory usage can be a real problem, and Andre Horstmann is aware
of it.  This full-featured word processor NDA is remarkably small: it only
takes 66K.  Horstmann even asks users to let him know which features
they could do without to make the program smaller.  To my way of
thinking, ShadowWrite is great just like it is.

     The thing I like best about the ShadowWrite NDA is that it is free.
Yes, ShadowWrite is FREEWARE.  Use it all you want, give it to your
friends, just do not sell it.  Now, can you beat that?  I hardly think so!

     If you would like to send E-mail to Andre Horstmann, his E-mail
address right here on GEnie is A.HORSTMANN.

                               [*][*][*]


Important Note!   Version 1.3.2 of ShadowWrite was uploaded during the
"""""""""""""""   writing of this review. You can find the new version at
file #21059. This update fixed a couple of bugs: (1) bug fixed that didn't
let you count words in documents larger than 64 Kb; (2)  bug fixed that
opened some Teach documents with wrong ruler and menubar colors.  Version
1.3.2 also added several new features. Softdisk Issue Text can now be
imported, although this feature has not been tested. The Preferences dialog
box now includes:  Save Window Size (Open Apple-A) - Click this button to
save the current window position and size as default window position and
size;  Scroll Speed - With this pop-up you can set the vertical scroll
amount field in the text editor.  Changes will get activated the next time
you open SW.

     Unfortunately, sometimes files are removed from the library after we
publish this magazine.  In many cases, the removed file has been replaced
with an updated version of that file.  If you can't find one of the files
listed here,  there is a way to check for a newer version.  Do a  keyword
search on the library using a word that describes the file you are look-

                        >>> WHO'S WHO ON GEnie <<<
                        """"""""""""""""""""""""""
                   ~ GEnieLamp Publisher/Senior Editor ~

GEnieLamp>   Tell us a little about John Peters.  Where are you from, what
"""""""""    is your educational background, and what do you do for a
             living?

John Peters>   Well, I was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, but I really don't
"""""""""""    remember much about it since I moved to Colorado at an early
age.  Colorado fits me just fine with the mountains and its comfortable
climate.  Strangely enough, I'm living in the state that is known for its
beautiful ski resorts but I've never been skiing.  I hear it's a blast.
Maybe someday...

     Education?  What's dat?  :)  My early life was filled with doctors,
nurses, and hospitals, so I missed out on many experiences I should have
had as a kid.  I don't dwell on that, though, as I'm much too busy making
up now for what I missed then.  I guess you could say I consider myself to
be a graduate from the, "School Of Hard Knocks" where, by the way, I passed
with honors. :)  Much of my education has come from books I read.  I drive
my wife crazy at times because it is rare that you will see me without a
book.  I read in restaurants, at sporting events, even when I go fishing!
I am truly fascinated (and at times, frustrated!) by the power of the
written word.  I plan on continuing this love/hate relationship with words
at a local community college this fall.

     As to my _real_ job it is right here on GEnie doing the GEnieLamp
mags, helping out with LiveWire Online and running the DigiPub RoundTable.
However, to pay the bills, the last 14+ years I've been working for the
Southland Corp. in a 7-Eleven convenience store here in Colorado Springs.


GEnieLamp>   What was your early experience with computers, and how did
"""""""""    you get involved in telecommunications?

John Peters>   Several years ago I was browsing in a TV/Stereo store and I
"""""""""""    came across a salesman who was showing a customer a computer
game that was hooked up into a large screen TV.  The game was called Star
Raiders.  I knew about home computers as I had my eye on a TRS-80 computer
at the local Radio Shack.  However, after seeing Star Raiders I knew right
then and there that the Atari computer was for me.  So I went to a local
computer store and talked the owner into letting me make payments on a
complete system.  Several months later, I was the proud owner of a 16K
Atari 400 computer!
 
     I had a lot of fun with my computer playing games and typing in
programs from magazines (anyone remember Softside Magazine?), but there
seemed to be something missing.  I didn't know it then, but a modem was the
answer to my problem because that missing something was people.

     However, modems back then were almost as expensive as the computer
itself.  When the cost of modems finally dropped below $100.00, I bought my
first one, a real 300 baud screamer!  What a difference the modem made in
my computing hobby.  I couldn't believe all the things that were available
to me with just a simple phone call.  Much to my wife's distress, I quickly
became obsessed with the online world.  Truly, the modem had become my
window to the world.


GEnieLamp>   What were the things that shaped your decision to begin the
"""""""""    GEnieLamp magazines?

John Peters>   After hooking up my new modem, I called my first BBS.  I
"""""""""""    then called another, and then another.  Within a week I was
active on several bulletin boards all over town.  I've always had an
interest in writing and it soon became obvious to me that this was the
perfect opportunity to start up an online newsletter.  I contacted a local
SysOp, told him about my idea and TeleTalk Online Magazine was born.
Within weeks TeleTalk was being offered on several BBSs around town and it
became quite popular.  Much to my surprise, after several issues were
published I started receiving Email from BBSs in other states.  When I
received Email from Sweden, I knew I was onto something truly special.  I
hooked up with local BBS SysOp Bob Connors (who is now the editor for
GEnieLamp IBM), and we created a nationwide network called T/TalkNET.  Soon
TeleTalk was being posted on BBSs and commercial online services
everywhere.

     After a couple of years of publishing TeleTalk, I wanted to do
something a little more computer-specific, so I came up with the idea of
doing an online magazine which contained nothing but mini-reviews on
shareware and PD software. I released three issues of PD_Quickview ST here
in the Atari ST RoundTable.  I wasn't satisfied with the new magazine, so
once again I started looking around for something else to do.  While
visiting the Atari RoundTable one evening, it occurred to me that maybe the
ST RoundTable would benefit from its own online magazine, so I sent off a
proposal to the SysOp, Darlah, and two weeks later I published my first
GEnieLamp ST.  And as they say, the rest is history.


GEnieLamp>   Most ventures of this nature are limited to one or two
"""""""""    computer platforms.  You've ambitiously attempted to offer a
publication specifically tailored to a rather wide variety of computer
platforms.  Why?  In retrospect, was this overly ambitious?


John Peters>   Good question!  Early on I had considered going to other
"""""""""""    SysOps here on GEnie asking if they would like to have a
GEnieLamp Magazine represent their RT, but I rejected the idea as I knew
that without GEnie's direct support the magazine would probably fail.  But
as fate would have it, a couple of months later I received a phone call
from the GEnie Computing RoundTable Product Manager asking me if I would
like to expand GEnieLamp into other computing areas.  Without blinking an
eye, I agreed.

     The original idea was to have one magazine which covered all the
computing RoundTables.  But I knew that by doing so I would end up with a
huge magazine that had a lot of general (i.e., boring) information which
would be pretty much meaningless to most of the readers here on GEnie.  So,
I went with a separate issue for each computer platform.

     As with any business, one of the keys to success is having good people
working for you.  Since I'm far from being an expert on all the different
brands of computers supported here on GEnie, I depend on my editors and
writers to collect the information that they feel will be of interest to
their readers.  In this respect I've been very lucky and have a great
support staff for all the magazines.

     Ambitious?  Yes.  Overly so?  I don't think so.  We've had our share
of problems and yes, most of these problems are due to the sheer size of
the GEnieLamp organization, but heck, that's what keeps things interesting!


GEnieLamp>   What kind of computer equipment do you use personally, and
"""""""""    why have you made the choice to use that kind?

John Peters>   From day one it's been Atari.  I know the system inside and
"""""""""""    out.  However, I am not a fanatic Atarian by any means and I
would publish GEnieLamp if I were on an Amiga, IBM, Macintosh or a
Sinclair.  To me, the computer is nothing more then a tool, a tool that
allows me to do what I love to do here on GEnie.  I may make the "big
switch" someday, but for now, the ST does what I want it to do.


GEnieLamp>   You've spoken quite passionately about your interest in
"""""""""    digital publishing.  For people who are not familiar with the
idea, tell us what digital publishing is all about.

John Peters   Ahhh....  Digital Publishing is another obsession of mine.
"""""""""""   Digital Publishing, in its simplest form, is what you are
reading now, an ASCII magazine that is created and distributed
electronically.  Getting a little more complex, there are machine specific
authoring tools and viewers such as Waldo, Dart, Iris, TX2 and others which
allow the publisher to include graphics or "hyper" abilities within the
text.

     I became interested in Digital Publishing when we didn't even have a
name for it.  Now, Digital Publishing in one form or another is making
headlines everyday.  I truly think that Digital Publishing is going to be
the next big wave to hit the computer industry.  Fortunately for those of
us on GEnie, we don't have to wait for that to happen as the future is here
and right now in a new RoundTable called the Digital Publishing RT.
Apparently I'm not alone in my feelings about Digital Publishing as the
DigiPub RT libraries are quickly becoming filled with poetry, online
magazines, newsletters, short stories, mini-novels and even tele-comics.

     Why the interest?  With Digital Publishing, _anyone_ can publish a
book or a magazine.  Like the programmer who tries to sell his or her
programs commercially, the typical writer faces the same seemingly
insurmountable odds in finding someone to publish his or her book.  But
programmers have found a way around this problem - they distribute their
programs as shareware or freeware.  Well, why not writers too?  In the
DigiPub RT (M1395) we have the tools, the experts, and the means to help
the author create and distribute their work, worldwide.  Now _that's_
exciting!


GEnieLamp>   Is the route that an "author" needs to take to be "published"
"""""""""    any different than he or she might pursue in a print media
setting?  I mean, I could write something pretty goofy and post it in the
DigiPub library and say I was "published."  Where are the quality controls?

John Peters>   There are no quality controls.  And why should there be?
"""""""""""    The thought of such a thing seems counter-productive to me,
especially here on GEnie, a public accessed system.  If you download
programs from the Computing RT's you know you're going to end up with a
"turkey" program now and then.  The same goes for Digital Publications.
The point is, the junior high school student who uploads his or her book
report is every bit as important as the established writer who uploads a
professionally written mini-novel.


GEnieLamp>   Back to the GEnieLamp.  You impress me as a person who wants
"""""""""    to keep doing better.  What do you want to see happen with
GEnieLamp over the next few months?

John Peters>   Overall, I don't see any major changes in the way we do
"""""""""""    GEnieLamp.  However, we will always be fine-tuning the
issues.  For example, I recently added a support column to GEnieLamp IBM
for the Windows RT and will probably be adding an OS/2 RT support column
later in the year.  The online interview concept (like the one you are
reading now) will be found in all the issues along with the popular
Mini_Bytes column now found in the IBM and ST magazine.  Also, we have a
special arrangement with the Newsbytes folks to reprint articles from their
popular online newsletter, so we will be phasing that into the all the
magazines in the next couple of months as well.

      On the downside, we tried to go with two issues a month but it didn't
work out like I wanted it to and I had to abandon the idea.  I still want
to do two issues a month, but I'm not going to attempt it again until I'm
sure I can do it successfully.

     Along the Digital Publishing lines, we are working with the Digital
Publishing Association in trying to come up with a format that would allow
all computers to view an online graphics based magazine by using a common
display language standard.  We are doing that now with our GEnieLamp TX2
and GEnieLamp Mac/Graphics issues.  However, the viewers are computer
specific and not interchangeable among other platforms.  I'd like to see
that limitation disappear.

     Another possibility I'm currently looking into is doing a hardcopy
issue of GEnieLamp either in newsletter format or as a magazine.


GEnieLamp>   This question is honestly not meant to be promotional.  I am
"""""""""    wondering why you choose GEnie as your on-line service?

John Peters>   GEnie is like an old pair of shoes.  It just feels right.
"""""""""""    Although GEnie is a huge system, it has a certain "homey"
feeling I've found lacking on other services.  From day one, I've felt
comfortable here on GEnie.

     But to be perfectly honest, I first joined GEnie because of the low
cost of being here.  All the nice people I've met, well, that's an added
bonus.  The bottom line is GEnie was, and still is, one of the best online
deals around.

                     >>> DRIVE G: IS FOR GENIE <<<
                     """""""""""""""""""""""""""""
         ~ Copyright 1993 by Al Fasoldt. All rights reserved ~

     Did I ever tell you about the time I used GEnie as a disk drive?

     You heard it right. I turned this telecomm service into a personal
hard-disk drive for an entire week a couple of years ago when I was
traveling with my ancient laptop computer.

     It all started when I arrived at my hotel in Chicago to cover the
Summer Consumer Electronics Show. I had driven from New York with the trunk
of my car filled with everything I needed - clothes, an extra pair of
shoes, notebooks, my sturdy old Bondwell laptop, the kind with two floppy
drives and a built-in modem.

     I couldn't afford the model with a self-contained hard drive, but that
was no problem. After all, I always carried a box full of support disks,
containing my word-processing software, my telecomm programs, my notes on
the electronics industry and my little database of phone numbers and
industry personnel.

     That is, I always HAD carried all these support disks. When I unpacked
my luggage at the Congress Hotel, there was my laptop, ready for action _
along with one floppy disk. All it had on it was MS-DOS and two utilities,
a stand-alone Xmodem transfer program and a copy of ARC, the
file-compression program. I had packed too quickly, and had left all my
vital support disks at home.

     Getting blank floppies in downtown Chicago wasn't a problem. I found a
store across the street that had just what I needed. But what about all the
software I had been using? Most of it was custom-designed. I had spent
weeks developing it a few years before, and had been so proud of it I had
even uploaded it to GEnie.

     To GEnie! Would my software still be there?

     More to the point, if they were still there, could I find a way to get
those files back from GEnie? I needed a way to download them. It was the
classic chicken-and-egg dilemma: Without a telecomm program, how could I
get the telecomm software that I needed to send my twice-daily reports on
the electronics show back to my newspaper office?

     I had a modem in my laptop, and I had DOS. And the Xmodem software I
had copied months ago onto the DOS bootup disk was supposed to be used with
a regular telecomm program. But I doodled around with it and saw that it
hooked into the modem's serial port even if I ran it all by itself.

     That was all I needed to know.

     I got the Chicago-area telephone number for GEnie by calling GEnie's
800 number. By using DOS to redirect my keyboard commands to the modem, I
dialed GEnie and navigated over to the PC software library. In a few
seconds, a search for PROCOMM brought up a listing for the shareware
version of that familiar telecomm software. I gave the command to GEnie to
start a download and typed the command to run my Xmodem transfer software
right from DOS.

     In a couple of minutes, I was in telecomm heaven. I signed off GEnie
and let ARC extract the Procomm files to a blank floppy.  Then I ran
Procomm and got back to GEnie, searching the file lists for the special
Procomm scripts that I had shared with other GEnie users.

     They were still there. And so was the little text editor that I had
fallen in love with and uploaded to GEnie in '86 or '87. And so were the
shareware spelling checker and the other little utilities I had found so
useful.

     GEnie even had the little database software I had uploaded. All that
was missing was my own data _ but I had a solution to that, too. I called
my office in New York and asked a coworker to find my backup database
floppy in my desk drawer. She called GEnie and attached the data to an
email message, and 15 minutes later I had the data, too.

     The week went by smoothly. I sent my reports back to my office by
direct transfer into a computer there, but I also sent copies of everything
by GEmail. And on my last day in Chicago, I compressed all my data and sent
it via email attachment to my own GEnie mailbox, so I could get it back
when I got back to the office.

     Since that time, I've joked about the extra drive I installed on my
laptop. It's got Drive A:, Drive B: and Drive G:. The first two hold 720
kilobytes each. The third holds the answer to a forgetful traveler's
prayers.

INTRODUCTION   The disk operating system used on the Apple II has an
""""""""""""   interesting and colorful story, and is a further insight to
the early days at Apple Computer, Inc.  This section of the History deals
with the original DOS for the Apple II, from its first release, up through
DOS 3.2.1. -Steven Weyhrich

                               [*][*][*]


APPLE DOS   For a computer to be useful, it must have a means of easy
"""""""""   storage and retrieval of data.  That storage medium must be
both convenient and affordable.  In the early days of the Apple II
computer, the best that they could achieve was "affordable".  The built-in
cassette port was THE state of the art for personal computers back in 1977;
the Apple I computer had a cassette interface available ONLY as an add-on
item.  But, although a cassette storage system may be inexpensive, it is
not very convenient.  The simplistic cassette operating system on the
Apple II (visual examination of the mechanical index counter on the
cassette recorder to know the location of the next program) was downright
frustrating to use for many early Apple II owners.  Something better was
desperately needed.

     As you may recall from Part 5 of the History, in December of 1977
Steve Wozniak began a crash effort to develop a floppy disk drive for the
Apple II computer.  To get it ready for the Consumer Electronics Show in
January 1978, Wozniak and Randy Wigginton made a very simple disk operating
system that would only load files from fixed locations off the disk in
response to one-letter commands.  But it was not a true disk operating
system (DOS); their rudimentary control program would not be flexible
enough for efficient and simple use of the disk drive.


DISK SYSTEM BASICS   To create an operating system that would be both
""""""""""""""""""   simple to use and yet powerful enough for advanced
file manipulations, Apple had much work to do, building on the device
driver that Wozniak had written.  Among other things, it had to interface
well with the BASICs in ROM on the Apple II, and be no more complicated to
use than the cassette system.  Although Woz's driver routines were
efficient in writing and reading data to and from the disk, they could only
be used from 6502 assembly language.

     Designing a disk operating system from scratch is no trivial matter.
On one side is the RAM memory in the Apple II, waiting patiently for a
useful program to be loaded and executed.  On the other side of an
electronic bridge (interface card and connecting cable) is the floppy disk
and disk drive hardware itself.  The control program the Woz wrote could be
compared to a narrow rope bridge crossing a chasm; it works, but you can't
carry much with you, and it is easy to slip and fall (lose data).  A
complete DOS is more like a concrete and steel bridge, capable of carrying
autos and trucks in both directions over the chasm.  Woz's "rope bridge"
was a foundation, but there was much work yet to do.

     A disk drive consists of a recording head that is mechanically moved
across the surface of the floppy disk, tracing the radius of the disk from
the center to the edge.  The disk itself is spinning under the head.  This
is similar to the stylus on a turntable that plays 33 RPM records (remember
those?), but the head on a disk drive can be given a command to move to a
different "track" on the spinning disk.  Also unlike the turntable, which
is a "read-only" device, the head on the disk drive can either reads bits
off or write bits onto the disk.  To be able to find where data has been
stored on a disk, it is "formatted" into a known configuration.  A blank
disk could be compared to empty land that will be filled with new houses,
but currently has no streets, street signs, or house numbers.  The initial
formatting (called "hard" formatting) of a blank disk is, then, like
building the streets and assigning lots for future building.  The second
part of disk formatting (called "soft" formatting), involves naming the
streets, designating addresses, and building houses.

     In the case of Apple's Disk II, it was designed with 35 concentric
circles ("streets") called tracks.  Each track is subdivided into 16
segments ("houses") called sectors.  Each sector can hold 256 bytes of
information.  In the hardware system that Wozniak designed, the timing hole
near the center of the floppy disk was not used by the hardware to keep
track of which sector was passing the head at any particular time.  Because
of that, it was necessary for the software to identify in a different way
where one sector ended and the next sector began.  A complicated method was
used of specially encoding each of the 256 bytes so they have a standard,
recognizable appearance to a program that is controlling the disk drive,
plus some other specialized bytes that identify the start and end of a
sector.  Although it did decrease somewhat the storage capacity of the
disk, the cost savings in less complicated hardware compensated for it.


DOS 3.1 - STRUCTURE & FUNCTION WITH BASIC   With this background, let's get
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   back to tracing the gap between
Woz's demo DOS and Apple's first official release, DOS 3.1.  Worth and
Lechner in their book, "Beneath Apple DOS", divided DOS up into four parts
according to function and location in memory.  When a computer needs an
operating system, it's because there is a need to insulate the user from
the complexity of trying to control the hardware.  Consider the four parts
of DOS as layers; as you get closer to the bottom layer, you are closer to
the hardware (the raw data on the disk and direct control of the disk
drive), but you also increase greatly the difficulty of managing it.  The
farther up you go, the easier it is to manage things on the disk, but the
less direct is the control of the disk data and hardware.<1>,<2>  When
Wozniak wrote his disk controller (driver) routines, he worked at the
deepest layer, directly manipulating the disk hardware and raw data.  This
involved some complex timing and error checking for reading and writing
data to the disk.  This section is also where the program lies that erases
the disk and creates the sectors and their addresses.  In memory, this
layer of DOS started at $B800 on a 48K Apple II.<2>,<3>

     Randy Wigginton wrote a "front end" for Wozniak's controller routines.
His part could be considered a thin layer that is part of the lowest layer
of disk routines.  Together, the two layers made up what came to be known
as "RWTS", or "Read/Write Track/Sector".  It could do four things only:
SEEK (to move the disk arm to the desired track), READ (load a sector from
disk into memory), WRITE (save a sector to disk from memory), and FORMAT
(discussed above).  This layer of DOS, the Disk II driver, started at
$B600.<2>,<3>

     Apple contracted with an outside consultant, Bob Shepardson, to write
much of the rest of DOS (though modifications were made by Apple
programmers Dick Huston and Rick Auricchio).<4>,<5>,<6>  Shepardson's group
wrote the layers (parts) of DOS that later became known as the "File
Manager" and the "Main DOS routines".  The File Manager was the next layer
in memory above RWTS.  It started at $AAC9 in memory, and was responsible
for twelve higher level functions that dealt with files and the disk in
general.  These functions were OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE, DELETE, CATALOG,
LOCK, UNLOCK, RENAME, POSITION, INIT (format a disk and create an empty
catalog track), and VERIFY.  This set of routines, along with RWTS, would
be similar to the file PRODOS in the current 8-bit disk operating system.
It handled the disk at the file level, but knew nothing about BASIC.<2>,<3>

     The next layer of code above the File Manager contained the Main DOS
Routines.  These routines started at $9D00 in memory, and were responsible
for interfacing BASIC with the disk.  This layer would be similar to the
file called BASIC.SYSTEM used today in the ProDOS system.  Since neither
Integer BASIC nor Applesoft were specifically modified to handle disk
commands, this part of DOS kept a constant look at any output PRINTed by
BASIC.  When a BASIC program was running, DOS looked to see if the
character Ctrl-D (hex $04) was printed immediately after a Ctrl-M (carriage
return).  If that sequence was detected, DOS assumed that the next text
printed was a command for it.  If a BASIC program was not running, then DOS
examined anything typed directly from the keyboard.  If it decided that a
DOS command had been entered, it would execute that command.  If the user
typed a command that DOS recognized (such as "RUN PROGRAM" or "SAVE
PROGRAM") but which resulted in a disk error, DOS 3.1 would generate an
error message.  On the other hand, if DOS did not recognize the command, it
passed it on to the active BASIC for processing.

     The final, uppermost layer of DOS was not a program code area but a
set of memory areas called "buffers".  One buffer was used by DOS for each
open file.  These buffers ordinarily started at $9600 in memory.

     Here is an example of how the layers of DOS interacted:  When a user
typed the command "LOAD PROGRAM" at the keyboard, DOS intercepted the
statement.  The Main DOS Routines determined that it WAS a legal DOS
command.  The File Manager was called to 1) OPEN a file named "PROGRAM",
2) READ all the bytes associated with that file into memory starting at a
specific location, and then 3) CLOSE the file.  The File Manager's OPEN
command in turn instructed RWTS where to move the disk read/write head, and
in what order to read the correct tracks and sectors to find the contents
of the entire file, wherever it happened to be on the disk.  Complicated,
perhaps, but the only thing the user had to know was how to type "LOAD
PROGRAM".

     Finally, one piece of trivia:  Why was the first DOS released for the
Apple II called "DOS 3.1" rather than "DOS 1.0"?  According to Steve
Wozniak, it was Bob Shepardson's group that decided on calling it "DOS 3".
It is unclear why Shepardson decided on "3"; possibly it referred to
internal revisions done by Shepardson, or perhaps it was a modification of
some DOS routines done for another computer that had used earlier version
numbers.<2>  (Note: DOS 3 was never actually released to the public; that
version apparently had a few bugs left to fix, so "DOS 3.1" came with the
first Disk II drives shipped by Apple to their dealers).


DOS 3.1 - MANUAL   When originally introduced with the new Disk II drive in
""""""""""""""""   1978, DOS 3.1 had very little documentation.  Because
the demand for the disk drive was so great, the engineers at Apple had
worked feverishly to produce enough working drives to begin shipping.  They
went out, although there was not time to complete a real manual on how to
use the disk operating system.  They did include a leaflet about some of
the commands, but there were still, obviously, complaints.  One letter to
Apple president Mike Markkula made these blunt comments: "You [expletive
deleted].  I bought an Apple with floppy and nobody, I mean nobody, in L.A.
or San Diego knows how to use the [thing] for random access files.  I
really feel 'ripped off.'  Everybody talks about this great manual in the
sky that is coming out soon??? ... [more expletives]!  I need this computer
now in my business not next year.  [Expletive].  I hope your dog dies."<7>

     It was not until the release of DOS 3.2 in February 1979 that a true
reference manual was made available.  It was given the unwieldy title,
"Disk II Floppy Disk Subsystem Installation and Operating Manual", and
subtitled "Apple Intelligent Subsystems (part #030-0011-00)".  It was all
of 38 pages long, with weak jokes and typos, but not much else of
substance.  Instruction on how to READ and WRITE text files was given in a
mere ten lines, with no programming examples.  The EXEC command was given a
little more description, but was still unclear to many users.  The manual
also talked about " *3D0G ".  What it DIDN'T say was that this meant that
the user was supposed to type "3D0G" from the Monitor prompt (to allow a
return to the active BASIC with DOS connected).<8>,<9>


DOS 3.1 - FEATURES   A catalog of the DOS 3.1 System Master disk would
""""""""""""""""""   produce this output:

  I 007 HELLO
 *I 043 APPLESOFT
  I 016 ANIMALS
  I 009 COLOR DEMOS
 *I 004 MASTER.CREATE
 *B 039 RAWDOS
 *I 007 COPY
 *B 007 COPY.OBJ

     "HELLO" was the startup file executed when the disk was booted.  It
just displayed the following:


  DISK II MASTER DISKETTE  VERSION 3.1

                             20-JUL-78

  COPYRIGHT 1978   APPLE COMPUTER INC.

>_

stopping at the Integer BASIC prompt.  "ANIMALS" was an Integer program
that gave an example of the use of disk files, and "COLOR DEMOS" was a disk
version of a program that had earlier come on cassette.  "MASTER CREATE"
was a program that could be used to initialize a "master" disk.  Using the
binary file "RAWDOS", it executed the DOS "INIT" command, but put a version
of DOS on the newly formatted disk that was relocatable.<10>  When DOS from
a "master" disk was booted on an Apple II, it first determined what was
size of the memory, and then loaded itself into memory as high as possible.
The INIT command properly formatted a new disk, but created what Apple
called a "slave" disk; that is, the DOS loaded from a slave disk was fixed
in memory to the same size as the computer on which DOS had been booted.
In most cases this would not be a problem.  However, the problem would
surface if someone whose Apple II had only 16K of RAM shared a disk with a
friend whose computer had, say, 32K of memory.  Booting that borrowed disk
would make the 32K computer appear to have only 16K of RAM (since it forced
DOS to load at the highest location available to a 16K machine).  A
"master" disk was more versatile, being "intelligent" enough to adapt
itself to differing memory sizes.

     The Integer BASIC file "APPLESOFT" was interesting.  It was a 43
sector file that appeared in a catalog as an Integer BASIC program (with
the "I" filetype code).  If you loaded the file and listed lines 10 through
80, there were lines that would produce the following text:


****************************************
*                                      *
*  APPLESOFT ][ FLOATING POINT BASIC   *
*             APRIL 1978               *
****************************************

There were also lines that poked some values into memory, and then jumped
to a machine language routine that relocated Applesoft into RAM starting at
$800 (the same place where Cassette Applesoft loaded).  If you tried to
LIST the entire program in memory, the lines after line 80 appeared to be a
jumble of Integer BASIC commands.  This is because a majority of the file
was actually a machine language program that had been appended to the end
of the short Integer BASIC program that displayed the title above and did
the memory pokes.  This machine language code was the Applesoft BASIC
interpreter.  Now, if the file "APPLESOFT" was executed by typing "RUN
APPLESOFT", it would display the title and leave the cursor next to the
Applesoft bracket prompt.  However, DOS was no longer connected; the result
was much like using Cassette Applesoft.  To properly use this file with
DOS, you had to type "FP" from the Integer BASIC prompt.  DOS would then
load the "APPLESOFT" file and properly initialize the interpreter, leaving
DOS connected.  Since this version of Applesoft still had a few bugs in it,
this method of using Applesoft was made obsolete by the Applesoft Firmware
card and the Apple II Plus.<9>

     Interestingly, the error messages produced by DOS 3.1 were made to
look similar to those displayed by Integer BASIC.  For example, this is
what happened if an attempt was made to load a type "B" (binary) file with
the "LOAD" command:

>LOAD COPY.OBJ
***DISK: NOT BASIC PROGRAM
>_

Integer BASIC had error messages that looked like "*** SYNTAX ERR" (with a
space following the asterisks).  The possible error messages in this
version of DOS that were different from later versions were:

SYS ERROR
CMD SYNTAX ERROR
NO FILE BUFFS AVAIL ERROR
NOT BASIC PROGRAM ERROR
NOT BINARY FILE ERROR


DOS 3.1 - USER EXPERIENCES   One problem encountered by early users of the
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Disk II was properly connecting the drive to
the controller card, as discussed in Part 9 of this History.  Some quirks
in DOS that plagued users at the time of the first releases of DOS 3.1
included one in which LOCKing a file sometimes mysteriously caused the
length of the first file in the catalog to change.  Apple told people not
to worry about that; in fact, they told people not to pay attention to the
sector counts in the catalog at all, as there was a bug in that part of the
catalog routine.  Another problem in early versions of DOS 3.1 was an
inability to execute READ or WRITE statements in an Applesoft program if
they occurred in program lines that were numbered higher than 256.  It also
wouldn't allow more than one DOS command on the same line of a program, so
this was not possible:

10 ON ERROR GOTO 1000
20 PRINT D$;"VERIFY FILE": PRINT D$;"OPEN FILE": PRINT D$;"READ FILE"

     Other bugs in early versions of DOS 3.1 included not being able to
initialize disks with MASTER.CREATE unless the disk controller was moved to
slot 7.  (Originally, slot 7 was going to be the disk slot, but Apple
decided to change it to slot 6 and leave slot 7 for video cards.  Why the
various 80-column cards that were eventually released were made to go into
slot 3 instead of slot 7 is anybody's guess).  The A.P.P.L.E. user group
had patches to MASTER.CREATE and RAWDOS to fix the slot 7 INIT bug, and the
>255 line number bug in Applesoft.<11>  Apple later released a modified
version of DOS 3.1 that fixed these bugs (without changing the version
number).


DOS 3.2 - ENHANCEMENTS   As mentioned above, DOS 3 and 3.1 had a few
""""""""""""""""""""""   problems.  When the Apple II Plus with the
Autostart ROM was released, DOS needed to be updated to handle the changes.
DOS 3.2, released in February 1979, contained several modifications, but
retained 90 percent of the basic structure of DOS 3.1.  One interesting
change made to plan for the future was a doubling of the number of possible
filetypes.  The original DOS used "I" for Integer BASIC files, "A" for
Applesoft, "B" for binary files, and "T" for text files.  DOS 3.2 added
types "S", "R", another "A", and another "B".  Of those four types, only
"R" was ever officially designated by Apple, and that for relocatable
assembler object files.

     DOS 3.2 included a program called "UPDATE 3.2", which worked much like
the earlier program "MASTER.CREATE" in changing a "slave" DOS disk into a
"master" disk.  As time went by, and more users had their Apple II's fully
populated with 48K RAM, the need for such a utility became less and less
important.<12>


DOS 3.2 - FEATURES   A catalog of the DOS 3.2 System Master disk would
""""""""""""""""""   produce this output:

 *I 002 HELLO
 *I 043 APPLESOFT
 *I 018 ANIMALS
 *B 009 UPDATE 3.2
 *I 014 COPY
 *I 009 COLOR DEMO
 *B 003 CHAIN
 *A 009 COLOR DEMOSOFT
 *A 028 LITTLE BRICK OUT
 *A 003 MAKE TEXT
 *A 003 RETRIEVE TEXT
 *A 010 EXEC DEMO
 *A 010 RANDOM
 *T 003 APPLE PROMS
 *A 039 RENUMBER INSTRUCTIONS
 *A 014 RENUMBER

     The file "RAWDOS" that was on the DOS 3.1 disk was no longer needed,
as its function was included in the "UPDATE 3.2" program.<10>  As you can
see, some of the files from the DOS 3.1 master disk were retained, but some
others were added.  There were now several Applesoft files, including a
version of the color demonstration ("COLOR DEMOSOFT"), a smaller version of
the older Integer BASIC game "BRICK OUT" ("LITTLE BRICK OUT"), a couple of
files to show simple disk access ("MAKE TEXT" and "RETRIEVE TEXT"), and a
program to exhibit the use of random-access disk files ("RANDOM", with the
file "APPLE PROMS").  There was finally a program ("EXEC DEMO") that showed
how to use the EXEC command in DOS.  Also found on this disk were two
utilities for Applesoft.  One made it possible to renumber Applesoft
programs, and the other ("CHAIN") allowed linking between multiple
Applesoft programs, retaining the value of any variables created by the
first program.  There WAS a CHAIN command built into DOS, but it worked
properly only with Integer BASIC programs.


DOS 3.2.1   In July 1979, DOS 3.2.1 was released.  This was merely a minor
"""""""""   upgrade to make some patches to RWTS and correct a timing
problem that caused the utility "COPY" to fail when copying disks with two
disk drives.  It also began a system disk version numbering system that
persists to this day, that of adding a third digit to indicate a minor
upgrade.  (For example, GS/OS 5.0 changed to 5.0.1 with some bug fixes,
rather than 5.1).<12>

     This disk contained the new COPY program, and a program called "UPDATE
3.2.1", which worked just as "UPDATE 3.2" and "MASTER.CREATE" had
previously.  The update program was used to modify existing DOS 3.2 disks
to the 3.2.1 version.  As an bonus, Apple added some programs to this
Master disk that were just for fun.  All written in Integer BASIC, the
games and graphics demonstrations included "APPLE-TREK", "THE INFINITE
NUMBER OF MONKEYS", "BRIAN'S THEME", and "BRICK OUT" (which was an Apple II
version of the arcade game, "Breakout").  The "HELLO" program displayed
this when the disk was booted:
