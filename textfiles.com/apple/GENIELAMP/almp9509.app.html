                        >>> GREAT EXAGGERATIONS <<<
                        """""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Rudyard Kipling subscribed to a newspaper which mistakenly published 
a notice of his death.  Kipling wrote to the paper:  "I've just read that I 
am dead.  Don't forget to delete me from your list of subscribers."

     When Bertrand Russell became seriously ill in China in 1920, he 
refused to grant interviews to the Japanese press, who retaliated by 
reporting that he had died.  Russell's requests to cease this nuisance went 
unheeded.  On his way home to England, Russell again stopped in Japan, and 
again the press asked for interviews.  Russell had his secretary give to 
each report a slip of paper which read:  "Since Mr. Russell is dead, he 
cannot be interviewed."

     When Apple Computer, Inc. stopped supporting the computer that made 
them rich and famous and began their incantation of "But we have a Mac 
that's much better!", many Apple II users felt so betrayed that they 
decided never to buy another computer from Apple.

     When America Online, formerly AppleLink Personal Edition, locked out 
Apple II users in 1994, they had the nerve not only to indulge in a little 
revisionist history (possibly due to an over-reliance on "boilerplate" form 
letters ), but to tell Apple II owners that America Online would be glad to 
take their money if they switched to a Mac or Windows computer.  AOL users 
jumped shipped with alacrity--many to GEnie, prompting a cry of "Where have 
you been all my life?" from many.

     Of course, America Online didn't go bankrupt when the Apple II folk 
left for GEnie, Delphi, CompuServe, and the Internet.  Apple Computer 
hasn't gone bankrupt because the Apple II community shun the Mac.  Last we 
heard, Japan still had newspaper reporters.  And the newspaper that greatly 
exaggerated reports of Kipling's death didn't fold simply because Kipling 
withdrew his subscription.

     When a company treats you badly, you are unlikely to be able to 
retaliate effectively.  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't retaliate at 
all, and it doesn't mean you won't affect the company at all.

     Apple Computer has been doing all right.  But it could have done 
better.  Perhaps they don't miss the revenue they've lost, but they have 
indeed lost revenue with its cavalier treatment of its original customers.  
They're so big, they don't notice little losses... until they start to add 
up.

     Recently, Mark Wade suggested that we gather together all our old 
"Tell Apple About..." cards that lurk in the back of Apple Computer 
manuals--or, occasionally, lurk in original packing boxes--and mail them to 
Apple to arrive on 15 September 1995, the ninth anniversary of the Apple 
IIgs.

     Someone cautioned that it wouldn't have any affect on Apple, Inc.  
They won't care that a lot of Apple II users are out here.  Some shmoe in 
the mailing room will have more garbage than usual to deal with, that's 
all.

     Probably true.  So what?  We probably won't improve our lot... but we 
aren't hurting anybody, either.  Let's join Rudyard Kipling and Bertrand 
Russell in tweaking the nose of those who counted us dead before our time.

     Even its heyday, tragically few people at Apple Computer appreciate 
the magic of the Apple II.  Let's just remind them that we're still out 
here.

     Someone was heard to wonder aloud, "What would have happened if we'd 
sent in our registration cards back when we first bought our Apple IIs?"

     (Well, it my case, it would have been duplication of effort, because 
my Apple dealer--a pretty good guy--assured me faithfully that my equipment 
had been registered at Apple, Inc.)

     No one can say for _sure_ what would have happened if we'd all sent 
our registration cards back "in time".  But here's my guess, for what it's 
worth:

     We'd all still be trying to get our names taken off Mac-only mailing 
lists.

                                 [*][*][*]


     A couple of goodbyes, this month.  First of all, our ASCII artist, 
Susie Oviatt has decided that she no longer has the three or fours hours it 
takes it much to dabble in ASCII.  (Actually, Susie decided that a couple 
of months back, but I've been running old art submitted for all versions of 
GEnieLamp that I personally haven't run yet.  I tried to keep her column 
"alive" as long as possible, but this month I've run out of art.)

     Also, Charlie Hartley, who has been handling the Treasure Hunt 
column, has come to a similar decision.  Charlie intends to stick his nose 
in with a profile occasionally, when time offers, though, so let's hope we 
haven't seen the last of him!

     In the meantime, GEnieLamp A2 is looking for more writers.  You can 
write for us regularly, or you can just submit an article for us when you 
have the time, but either way, we'll pay your for it in GEnie credits.  If 
your article is accepted, you'll receive credit on your GEnie bill worth 
two non-prime time hours!

SUPERDRIVE TIP FOLLOWUP   I was reading a copy of the October 1994 issue of 
"""""""""""""""""""""""   GEnieLamp A2, where I noticed a "tip" from David 
Kerwood and Hugh Hood about the SuperDrive Card's self test.  The tip 
mentioned in passing that the program MAC.TRANS.GS would read Mac MFS 
formatted disks, but not with the SuperDrive card.  Actually, only a small 
tweak is necessary to fix it for any(?) interface card.

     Simply add the following lines to the program (another example of the 
advantages of programs written in Applesoft!):

     26 X = (192 + SM) * 256 + 255 : X=PEEK(X) : REM X = PEEK($CnFF)
     27 POKE 803,X : REM Set correct entry offset for the default device

     3106 X = (192 + SM) * 256 + 255 : X=PEEK(X) : REM X = PEEK($CnFF)
     3107 POKE 803,X : REM Set correct entry offset for this device

     Cheers,
            Peter

P.S.  Have I missed something?  Has GEnielamp A2Pro disappeared?

ADDISON-WESLEY BOOKS ON CD-ROM?   Considering that many of the Apple II 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   books are becoming rare, I think it would 
be a good idea if someone approached Apple/Addison-Wesley about allowing 
someone to make the entire set of Apple II (II and II GS) books on CD-ROM.  
I'm sure they already have the text on computer.  All that would be needed 
is to either convert it to something more Apple II friendly or make a 
program that could read that format.  In addition it would be more then 
helpful to have a program on there as a search engine for finding stuff in 
the manuals.  Finally a price below $100 would make it affordable!  Am I 
dreaming too much?  I suspect this would be a well selling product, 
relatively speaking and be a great help to Apple II development.  EVen 
those with most of the manuals would find it helpful in finding things 
fast.  It could also have all the current tech notes and other DTS stuff.  
I'm almost sure this could all fit on one CD. What do you think?

APPLESOFT AND DESKJET 500   Is there anyone here who is successfully 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   printing to a DJ500 via an Applesoft BASIC 
program?  If so, please share the secret of your success. :)

     I know that simply pointing the program to slot 1 (or whatever slot 
you happen to have the DJ500 linked to) is not enough.  Apparently there 
are specific printer codes that are needed so that the printer will accept 
and print straight ASCII text.

     I don't know if the SyQuest has a SCSI ID external selector or if it 
uses internal jumpers.  I don't know what type of SCSI connection the 
SyQuest uses, but judging by its small size I would guess a 25-pin like the 
Iomega.  Performance numbers are the manufacturer's estimates.  The 
disks/cartridges are =not= interchangeable, they are different sizes, but 
both are about the size of a double-thick 3.5" disk.

     MacWarehouse carries both drives and will send you a fax data sheet 
or give voice information by calling 1-800-255-6227.  I don't work for 
MacWarehouse, I just happened to get the information from them.

IIGS LAB SETUP   > I would be very interested in knowing how your lab is 
""""""""""""""   > set up.

     Well, you asked for it ;)

     Here goes:

     We have 22 GSs (not enough - hopefully we can stick in a few more), a 
LaserWriter 360, and an ImageWriterII (with AppleTalk card) hooked to an 
LC575 server that is presently running System 7.1 and AppleShare FileServer 
and PrintServer v.3.0.1 (I think).  Each of the GSs has an Apple 3.5" and 
an AE 3.5" drive.  (Only 1 GS has a 5.25", and that never gets used).  
About 1/2 of the GSs have a HyperStudio sound digitizer card and 
microphone.  Finally, each GS now has a 4Meg RAM card!!!  Yay!!!

     Additionally, there are a half dozen classrooms with either //e or 
IIGS computers that are also hooked to this network.

     The GS System Software we use is 6.0.1 (necessary due to a conflict 
between GSOS 5.0.4 and either the LC575, Mac System 7.1, or AShare 3.0.1 - 
but better anyway except that there's only room for one printer driver).  
We use Pointless v2.0.3 and access numerous fonts from the server (works 
nicely).  Presently, each of the GSs starts up from a 3.5" disk in the AE 
drive and we have one user name that provides access to all programs.  That 
user name brings up a menu program called Menu Master (v1.6.5).  Pretty 
much all programs are available from the server.  We run AWGS from a 3.5" 
disk as it is used quite a bit and loads MUCH faster this way.  Now that we 
have the RAM, however, we will be changing to a graphical menu based on 
HyperStudio (which is fast running from the RAM Disk).  The additional RAM 
will also allow us to have printer drivers for both the LWr & IWr at the 
same time.  BTW, we leave the server on all year and leave the GSs on all 
week.  The monitors are supposed to get shut down if the lab will be empty 
for a half hour or more, but they pretty much stay on all day.

     The next thing that I would like to start fighting for is a router 
from Tribe that would allow us to break the network up into several smaller 
groups to speed things up.  The idea is to have an EtherNet connection 
between the server and the router, and then several LocalTalk cables 
running from the router to small groups of machines.  Since it is 
LocalTalk, and not the server, that is the bottleneck dividing the network 
up should speed things up.  Using the 3.5" disks to start really helped 
speed things up a lot.  The TribeStar would help even more.  We'll see, 
though.

     > What software do you run.

     Let's see?  For software, we have pretty much the whole MECC 
collection - both P8 & GSOS (World & USA GeoGraph, StoryBook Weaver, 
Designer Prints, Calendar Crafter, etc.), AppleWorks 3.0n & 
AppleWorksGSv1.1 site licenses, HyperStudiov3.1j, Platinum Paint, 
LogoWriter, TheFactory.  In addition, I hope to add licenses to use Quick 
Click Calc (for excellent graphing capabilities) and the discQuest 
encyclopedia, but we'll see.

     > Is there a source of educational Hyperstudio/Hypercard stacks
     > available for download or purchase?

     Roger Wagner publishing has a nice catalog of some excellent 
commercial stacks.  You could probably give them a call.  Of course, there 
are numerous stacks on GEnie.

     Outside of the lab I will be experimenting quite a bit this month on 
using a video overlay card and a Second Sight card to do presentations on a 
big-screen TV and/or LCD projection panel.  I'm anxious to see how that 
works.

     It's all fun, and extremely valuable. Now if I just had more time ;)

KANSASFEST '95 REPORT--THE TRADITION CONTINUES   Up until a few months ago, 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   there was some doubt that 
anyone would ever read the title of this article, because the fate of 
KansasFest was caught in the balance.  Over the years, KansasFest has been 
held at Avila College, a small quaint college located on the south side of 
Kansas City Missouri.  The sponsors of KansasFest have been numerous - the 
'94 KansasFest was sponsored by a company called ICON (previously called 
Resource Central).  When they went out of business last year, it wasn't 
known if anyone would pick up the Apple II torch and conduct another 
KansasFest.  But just as the Apple II computer has "kept going, and going, 
and going," so has KansasFest.  Through the efforts of people like Auri 
Rahimzadeh, Cindy Adams, Gina Saikin, and Mark Kline, among others - 
KansasFest '95 was made a reality.  Parkhurst Micro Systems (Paul 
Parkhurst) was the corporate sponsor of the fest. You might know Parkhurst 
Micro Systems (a company who has supported the Apple II line of computers 
over the years) from their excellent ANSI-Term modem program.  So here's 
"one man's story" of  KansasFest '95.

     Being "just a user," I wasn't sure if I should attend KansasFest.  I 
think that feeling has kept many others from attending in the past - it had 
for me.  But all those trepidations faded away as I communicated to some 
other KansasFest attendees on GEnie prior to leaving for Kansas City. 
During those e-mail exchanges, I learned that KansasFest was going to be 
one big friendly user's group meeting.  I found out that I wasn't the only 
KansasFest Rookie that was attending this year, and that the vast majority 
of the attendees were just "average Apple II users."  So like a kid on 
Christmas Eve, I anxiously awaited the start of a famous Apple II 
tradition.

     I arrived at the Kansas City airport on the evening of July 26th, a 
day prior to the official start of KansasFest.  After renting a car, I 
drove down to KC Masterpiece.  A group of people I met on GEnie had gotten 
together to have dinner at this infamous KansasFest hang out.  Entering the 
restaurant was like going on a blind date - although I had seen their names 
on electronic messages, I hadn't met any of them before.  But that feeling 
instantly changed to one of meeting "old friends" as I was warmly greeted 
and started talking to everyone.  That's the spirit of KansasFest, and I 
think of the Apple II computer community in general, it's one big inclusive 
family!  It was neat listening to Joe Kohn, Greg Templeman, and many other 
Apple II lovers.  Everyone had such unique and diverse backgrounds, but all 
shared a fascination with the almost unlimited capabilities of the Apple II 
computer. After a delicious BBQ rib meal, great conversation, and finally 
putting some faces to names, I headed to a nearby motel for a good nights 
sleep.

     Arriving at Avila College at 9 am the next day, I checked into the 
dorms.  Spending KansasFest in the dorms is the best way to experience this 
event.  Not only is it cheaper, but you get to interact with everyone after 
hours.  The rooms were clean, but Spartan.  It's been 18 years since I've 
lived in a college dorm room, but I think the surroundings added to the 
total experience. I immediately unpacked and started to visit all the other 
attendee's rooms to see what computer systems they had brought - and it was 
a diverse lot.  There were dozens of IIgs computers, with every imaginable 
peripheral attached.  There were IIcs, MACs in all flavors, PowerBooks, 
Newtons, and even a II+.  It was great to see the new Iomega Zip drive in 
action, how the new SecondSight VGA card looked with different monitors, 
and the various hard drives and CD-ROM drives available for the Apple II.

     After "hob knobbing" with everyone in the morning, we hit the 
cafeteria for some typical college dorm food.  All meals were included in 
the price if you stayed in the dorms, a very good deal. The food quality 
was OK, you could eat all you could stand.  There was a salad bar and 
self-serve ice cream in the dining area after you picked up your main 
course.  Some of the food over the fest included BBQ chicken, soft tacos, 
bratwurst, spaghetti, hamburgers, and various vegetables at each meal.  
Meal time was another avenue to meet Apple II legends like Tom Weishaar, 
"Burger" Bill Heineman, Roger Wagner, etc, and make new friends.

     The first activity after lunch was a talk by Apple Computer's Ashley 
Carter, discussing some new computers due out over the next couple of 
months.  New Performas, coming out in August 95, will be going over to RISC 
processors and incorporate industry standards like PIC slots.  They'll have 
replaceable processors for future upgrades.  For example, you can drop in 
DOS Windows chips, when they become available, to run those types of 
applications.  In September 95, expect a slew of new PowerBooks to start 
coming out.  You'll be able to transmit data to other PowerBooks through 
infrared signals.

     Following that one hour presentation, each attendee had the choice of 
attending one of three presentations.  Talking to the Apple rep about the 
new computers, learning basic soldering (entitled: "Which End is Hot"), or 
attending a "fireside" chat with Joe Kohn - I chose the latter.

     Joe Kohn has attended six previous KansasFests and this is the third 
year he's given presentations at them.  He described starting off with the 
Apple II, he got an Apple II+ and 100 disks of public domain software.  He 
was in awe of what was out there.  In the mid-80's he started the Apple 
Users Resource Group, which lead to the Apple II Information Exchange.  It 
was bought out by Compuserve in '89.  Joe wrote a series of articles on 
shareware programs for the Apple II Buyers Guide and transitioned to the 
Big Red Computer Club as their Librarian in '83.  From there, he hooked up 
with InCider to write a shareware article.  InCider asked Joe to put 
together a disk containing the shareware programs his article covered.  
After much persuasion, Joe finally began supplying those disks to people.  
He mentioned that InCider was making money each month right to the very 
end!  But Joe guessed that the magazine wasn't making ENOUGH profit, so 
that's why they pulled the plug.  After InCider's demise, Joe thought about 
writing for II Alive.  But luckily for us, those plans never came together 
and he struck out on his own with Shareware Solutions II (SSII).   When he 
worked for other publications, he use to hate editors - they always changed 
what he wrote.  But now he misses having an editor when producing SSII.  
Joe feels SSII is the "Consumer Reports" of the Apple II world.  He 
emphasized that Apple II users should "support those who support you."  In 
other words, don't delay buying those Apple II products you can use and 
paying those shareware fees, otherwise there won't be anything new in the 
future.  Joe has sold about 120 copies of ContactGS - not enough for any 
real profit, but he was glad he made it available to the IIgs community.  
Finally, Joe made an announcement that Symbolix (a powerful mathematics 
program from Switzerland) is being released as shareware.  SSII will be 
providing it for $15 for the first month - half the profit will go toward a 
yet to be named non-profit organization.

     The next period consisted of a demonstration of Mike Westerfield's 
Quick Click Morph (QCM) or Ryan Suenaga's discussion of Personal Digital 
Assistants & PowerBooks.  I decided to see Mike's great new program.

     Mike started off with a quick history behind morphing.  The first 
Cray computer ever built didn't go to the defense department, but instead 
went to Hollywood movie studios to do morphing.  The first morphing was 
done by Disney, all accomplished by hand.  But since almost anything can be 
done on an Apple II computer, Mike brought this morphing capability to the 
IIgs.  The user provides a starting and ending picture to QCM.  A series of 
reference points are then easily selected on the first and last picture.  
QCM then starts computing the "tween" frames - new pictures that transform 
the first picture into the second.  Morphing time increases as the number 
of  "tween" frames increases and the number of reference points are 
increased.  The time to create a full morph sequence can take from several 
minutes to overnight - an accelerated IIgs is not required but is HIGHLY 
recommended.  Those "tween" pictures, when played as a PaintWorks 
animation, provides a smooth morph between the start and ending pictures.  
The visual impact of morphing cannot be overstated.  Morphs can be added to 
HyperStudio stacks, used as a screen saver, or any place that can use 
PaintWorks animations.  Single frames can also be viewed to see how each 
"tween" picture has changed.  Although 16 shades of gray is best for the 
IIgs, QCM supports 320/640 color pallets, custom colors, and 128/256 custom 
color pallets.  Mike has also developed a freeware program Quick Click 
Movie - it allows the viewing of QCM animations.  So with this freeware 
program, you can easily share your creations with friends and the world.  
Quick Click Morph is a very powerful and unique program - you really have 
to see it to appreciate its impact and ease of use.

     After supper, the KansasFest '95 keynote address was given.  The  
keynote speaker was the (in)famous Roger Wagner of HyperStudio fame.  As 
usual, he gave a very animated and entertaining speech. First describing a 
very artistic video produced by a IIgs user in France - combining 
HyperStudio with a video overlay card on a IIgs. The video was done a few 
years ago and won critical acclaim.  Following the interesting video, Roger 
described his introduction to computing and the Apple II.  He had a sum of 
money to buy either a motorcycle, a stereo, or a computer.  He thought that 
if he purchased the motorcycle or stereo, he would just end up spending 
more money on them.  The computer, he thought, would be a one time expense.  
He tried selling computers door-to-door, he failed miserably.  He then 
wrote some small programs, initial sales were good, but Apple computer 
inevitably released a free program doing the same thing a while later.  He 
kept ahead of Apple and eventually produced HyperStudio - a revolutionary 
program that brought Hypermedia to computers.  Roger now goes around the 
country showing how schools and individuals can produce outstanding 
presentations with HyperStudio.  Although Roger is concentrating on 
developing and marketing products for the MAC and other platforms, he's 
still supporting the venerable Apple II platform.

     The last series of presentations that day were: Joe Kohn discussing 
changes to the Internet, Erick Wagner presenting how to hook up "real 
world" devices to the Apple, and Eric Shepherd demonstrating two of his new 
IIgs programs (StationKeeper and ShiftyList 2.0).  I wanted to attend all 
three, but I ended up listening to Sheppy.

     Sheppy's StationKeeper is something like a document alias.  You 
double-click a document icon, Finder opens up the application that supports 
the document (AppleWorksGS, ShadowWrite, etc) and you start working on it.  
Nothing special so far, but when you save the document, it's saved as a new 
document - you don't mess with the original.  This would be good for 
filling out forms, etc.  ShiftyList 2.0 will be distributed on a Softdisk 
G-S issue. This version is a very powerful update.  By holding down 
different key combinations during booting, you can load different groups of 
INITs, NDAs,  CDAs, and CDEVs.  The composition of each group is determined 
by the user beforehand.  You can also create boot scripts.  Scripts could 
run pictures or sounds during booting.  For example, you could display a 
picture and play a sound, load some INITs, display a new picture, load some 
NDAs/CDAs, display another picture and play a sound, and load the rest of 
your system - total user control.  Sheppy expects ShiftyList to be out at 
the end of the year.  He lost three months of work when his hard drive 
crashed.  As Sheppy remarked, "apparently back-ups aren't for weenies."  
Sheppy also has compiled a spiral bound book containing documentation for 
all his software.  The book can be purchased for about $12, contact him at 
E.Shepherd@genie.com. He is also selling a disk containing all his 
non-Softdisk G-S programs.

     That ended the first day's formal presentations.  That evening  
consisted of seeing what computers people had brought, seeing new software 
and equipment, and discussing every topic you can imagine.  Roger Wagner 
generously ordered a couple dozen pizzas and a few cases of soda for 
munching late that night.  Right afterward, the infamous Bite-The-Bag 
contest began - a KansasFest tradition.  The object is to balance on one 
appendage (foot, hand, etc) and grab the top of an empty grocery bag on the 
floor with your teeth.  It's not too hard at the start.  But as the 
competition continues, the upper most part of the bag is slowly removed.  
Soon, there's nothing left but the flat bottom of the bag laying on the 
floor.  Oh yes, did I mention that if you aren't the first person, you get 
to enjoy the slobber on the bag left by the people in front of you?  The 
competition this year was stiff.  There were over a half-dozen people still 
able to pick up the bag when it was nothing more than a flat piece of 
paper.  It finally came down to who was the fastest.  Russ Nielson was 
crowned the King of "Bite -The-Bag" with a time of 1.95 seconds!

     Because everyone participates in the sleep depravation experiment 
called KansasFest, the dawn of the next day came way too early.  For those 
who were sane enough to get a couple hours sleep, or insane enough to get 
no sleep, breakfast was available at 7am.  The first sessions began at 
8:45pm - so most could still get a few winks.  Roger Wagner provided a 
discussion of using the mulimedia capabilities of the IIgs, Doug Pendleton 
& Dave Ciotti taught the second segment on soldering, and a trio (Richard 
Bennett, Tim Buchheim & Nathaniel Sloan) demonstrated the new Apple IIgs 
front end for GEnie.  I picked the GEnie software demo.

     This stand-alone program is called Jasmine, it's a real-time IIgs 
interface for GEnie - not an off-line reader like CoPilot or GEM.   You 
don't need a separate modem program like ProTerm or Spectrum - Jasmine 
handles everything.  It requires System 6.0.1 and an error-correction modem 
(the internal Datalink 2400 is not, but all high speed modems are) - a hard 
drive is not required.  Jasmine allows 3rd-parties to write add-ons - like 
Balloon (a file compression/decompression program).  It supports Zmodem and 
will support batch Ymodem file transfers. The interface is all point and 
click, using familiar IIgs windows, menus, and dialog boxes.  It's Lynx 
compatible, so you can access the Internet via GEnie. Jasmine is free and 
should be out shortly.

     The next series of sessions consisted of Mike Westerfield discussing 
Quick Click Morph (QCM) from a programmer's view point, Mark Kline & Cindy 
Adams discussing AppleShare networking, and Erick Wagner presenting the 
second part of controlling "real world" devices with a computer.  Since I 
missed Erick's first session, and I'm not into networking, I decided to 
hear Mike's presentation.

     Mike gave a good insight into how QCM works.  A good way to 
understand how the program transforms a picture is to imagine the first 
picture being made of rubber.  You take a pencil point and stick it to one 
of the reference points.  You then drag the pencil and stretch the picture 
to the corresponding reference point on the ending picture.  This dragging 
and stretching is done simultaneously for each reference point.

     After lunch another series of sessions were given.  Tony Diaz from 
Alltech Electronics showed how to build a tower case for the IIgs, Roger 
Wagner presented new things he's working on, and Glenn Hofman discussed a 
new Apple IIgs GEnie off-line reader called PowerGuide.  Since I spend a 
lot of time on GEnie, I thought I'd get the most from Glenn's presentation.

     PowerGuide is a stand-alone program that does not use another modem 
program like Spectrum or ProTerm.  It uses the familiar IIgs interface, 
it's all point and click with keyboard equivalents.  It uses Zmodem file 
transfers, employs cut & pastes message quoting, has an address book for 
e-mail messages, supports 30 GEnie RoundTables, and uses it's own installer 
for easy installation. Although still in beta testing, it's available now 
and it functions well.

     The next sessions were Dave Ciotti showing how to perform some simple 
equipment maintenance operations (change a system saver fan, clean a 
keyboard, etc), Eric Shepherd demonstrating ProTerm MAC, and Greg Templeman 
discussing the GS Lib Programming Library.  The choice for me was easy, the 
equipment session.  Dave did an outstanding job answering questions and 
showing how even a novice user can fix things on an Apple IIgs.

     Following those sessions, Richard Bennet gave a short recap of what 
Seven Hills is doing.  SuperConvert 4.0 is about to ship - it's just 
waiting for documentation to be printed.  The program will squash a few 
bugs and add SecondSight and JPEG support.  The new version of 
GraphicWriter III should be out within a month. It fully supports System 
6.0.1 font menu and interface.  The spell checker has been re-written, text 
wrapping around objects has been fixed, objects can now be positioned by 
typing in coordinates, objects can be resized, and an extras menu has been 
added so 3rd parties can write add-ons to GraphicWriter III.

     A banquet and roast topped off the day's event.  The roastee was none 
other than Steve Disbrow of GS+ Magazine.  Bill Moore, Roger Wagner, Tom 
Weishaar, and Joe Wankerl did a great job putting Steve in his place.  Of 
course Roger went high tech, with a mulitmedia presentation.  Tom Weishaar 
read a hilarious letter from "Bob Dole" talking about Steve and GS+ 
magazine.  Joe played a funny song about Steve.  Then it was Steve's turn 
to roast the roasters.  All in all, it was a great time.

     Following the banquet, people went back to the dorms for more 
socializing.  A debug room was setup so people could get help with 
equipment problems.  Some attendees went to see movies, some played Trivial 
Pursuit, and a nerf rocket war erupted.  Again, most people ended up 
without much sleep.

     The next day was bitter sweet.  People began moving out of the dorms, 
KansasFest '95 was rapidly coming to a close.  But after breakfast, Paul 
Parkhurst gave an excellent demonstration of his new NDA FAX program.  He 
created, sent, received, and printed faxes using his new program.  Although 
still in final beta testing, it still worked like a charm.  Some features 
demonstrated: generations of fax lists/groups (the cover page can be 
automatically personalized for each number on the list), multiple phone 
books, scheduled send, selection of cover pages, use of a dial prefix, 
selection of modem initialization string, and a host of others.  The fax 
cover page capabilities were outstanding.  The user has a lot of control 
over the data on the cover sheet, including adding 
memos/graphics/headers/footers/page numbers and automatically adding 
names/address/phone numbers.  The program works with Express and will be 
compatible with Spectrum. You can print selectable pages from a fax and can 
even send a quick fax (it sends a cover page with a memo you type in). The 
program is expected to ship in a couple months with a price tag in the area 
of $80.  There will be a discount when updating from a competitor's fax 
program.  It was a very impressive demonstration.

     Following the fax demo, people headed to a swap meet/vendor fair 
where attendees scooped up many bargains.  Byteworks, GS+, Digisoft, and 
Shareware Solutions II products were all on sale. Many items were quickly 
sold out.  The final official function was one last lunch at the college 
cafeteria.  Attendees reluctantly said a fond farewell.  Some attendees, 
who were leaving Sunday, arranged to have one last dinner that night at a 
local restaurant.  But before things concluded, there was an official 
announcement - a KansasFest will be held in 1996!

     I can't emphasize enough how much fun it was to attend KansasFest. I 
strongly encourage all Apple II and MAC users to attend next year.  You'll 
be warmly welcomed, fit right in, and a have a super time sharing your 
computer interests with others. See you at K'fest next year!

Paying for armed guards certainly adds unnecessarily to the cost of such an

     (and it was rather warm outside.  the air-conditioned tunnels are 
quite nice..:)

     (btw, I don't know if it happened to anyone else.  But Sloanie, 
Richard (I think he was with us), and I were stopped by an Avila staff 
member and asked not to use the tunnels.  That was annoying.)

>>>>>   > This is the first year that guards have been present on the Avila

     I can only say that this can be due to the "signs of the times".  I 
doubt that Kfest was singled out for this 'honor'.  As Cindy said, 
considering the thousands of dollars of equipment owned by the 'festers, it 
was NOT a bad idea.

> This is the first year we were not able to stay in the dorms on
> Wednesday night and Saturday night.

     This was attributable directly to the late start we got in planning 
kfest due to problems at the very beginning.  We are making SURE that we 
have the time next year we've had in the past...that is, Wed through 
Sunday.  Also, there was a MAJOR sports event at Avila that was held in 
Switzerland last year...

> This is the first year that Avila became a dry campus.

     Huh?  I thought beer was served/drunk?  Since I'm not a beer drinker, 
I didn't pay much attention, but I could swear I saw several people with 
beers in hand walking around???

> This is the first year that smoking was not allowed in the dorms.

     Be glad it was allowed in the dorm ROOMS!  Again, this is yet another 
sign of the times...many, many places are banning smoking - many fast-food 
places are doing this.  HOw many of us work where we can smoke now?  Almost 
any where we have it we'll run into smoking rules and regs.

> This is the first year 90% of the rules that were in effect existed.

     Well, we had little to no complaints about us from the Avila 
staff...that should say something!  Also, we did NOT play cop and come down 
hard on you guys!  The rules were there and written out...remember, this 
was our first attempt at getting something like this together...and it was 
all done online or by phone.  We didn't have Tom's benefit of living on top 
of the college practically!  We were concerned about liability and so on.

> This is the first year we were not in classrooms.

     Again, part of this was due to the scheduling and the late start.  
Part was due to last-minute changes when Cindy and Paul got there.  For 
instance, we WERE assigned 2 classrooms (2?) but we chose to use only one, 
so that we could have the debug room and the telecom room in an area where 
we had at least a shot at hooking up a phone line!

> This is the first year we had to meet in the lobby of the theater.

     Again, space constraints, late start, etc forced us into this 
situation

     Also, people have remarked about not using the tunnels.  Though I'm 
not certain of the rationale, I would highly suspect security again.  
Remember, more and more places are leaning more and more heavily toward 
security measures...what with all the terrorism, violence and so on (just 
look at OK City).  I would suspect the Avila staff preferred we stayed out 
of the tunnels so we couldn't end up somewhere they didn't want us to be. 
Again...security was more than likely the reason.

     And now to some more firsts.

     This was the first year it was run by a committee of folks who had 
never really set such a monstrosity up, rather than a company who had set 
it up for years!

     This was the first year that planning was literally begun four months 
before the event, and inspite of this, we not only filled the Avila dorm 
rooms, but had people staying in hotels/motels outside!

     This is the first year that we've had so many NEW faces!

     All in all, I think the committee did one heck of a job with what 
they had to work with...with the short time constraints, the initial 
glitches in getting started and so on.  We are already planning NOW for 
next year, which means we should get the best of what we want...and more 
time...Wed through Sunday, for example.

WHY GET A SECOND SIGHT?   The current version of the card gives your GS 
"""""""""""""""""""""""   640x480x256 resolution (yes, FULL 8-bit color.)  
With the AppleColor RGB, you are limited to 640x400x256 interlaced (some 
flicker) but with a VGA monitor, 8-bit GIFs displayed on your GS will look 
just like they do on a PC or a Mac.  An upcoming ROM upgrade will allow the 
card to really show its colors, its FULL 24-bit colors!  If you are 
familiar with Mac-Speak, you will have "thousands" mode (Hi-color) at up to 
800x600 and "millions" mode (True-color) at up to 640x480.  The maximum 
size the card can handle is 1024x768.

     The only caveat is that there is no patch for Quickdraw yet (it's 
being worked on though.)  This means the standard desktop screens will look 
just like they do now, albeit a LOT bigger depending on your monitor (you 
should see Finder on a 17" monitor!)

     But the fun doesn't stop there.  You know how the GS text screen has 
those unsightly horizontal lines through the text?  Well, with Second Sight 
and a VGA monitor you get crystal clear, SOLID text.  This is a godsend to 
anyone who spends lots of time in ProTERM or AppleWorks or anything else 
that uses the text screen.  With the AppleColor RGB, however, you still get 
the lines but the font is easier to read.  It's eerily similar to the 
MS-DOS font, which takes some getting used to, but it's very nice.

     If all that sounds good to you, you will love Second Sight.  Ask 
anyone at KFest who saw it running on a 14" monitor in my room and they'll 
tell you how good it really is.

     It CAN be chicken and egg:  "we won't develop unless there's an 
interest"; "there won't be an interest unless we develop".  However, Seven 
Hills is one of several developers/publishers who are so excited about 
Second Sight that we're not waiting! :)

     I don't know what's in the $50 developer's package, but I personally 
know two people who are really pushing the SS to the limits without having 
anything more than the information that's been available, so it CAN be done 
without the package.  {And I "unpersonally" know of several more developers 
who are working on some nifty things, again without benefit of the 
developer's package.}

     If you're wondering exactly what can be done with the information 
that's currently available, here's a deal:

 - IF you own Spectrum v2.0
 - AND you own a Second Sight card
 - AND you dial ANSI boards or use GEnie's Internet access

send private email to "SevenHills" and say, "I meet your criteria; let me 
beta-test an ANSI update that'll knock my socks off!"

practice.

     About the SS docs:  If all you need is the programmer's library, that 
and its documentation and sample source is all available for free on the 
Internet.  From what I understand, the developer's kit will include a Z180 
reference, along with other docs about the SVGA controller.  The books 
probably account for a good chunk of that $50.  And while I haven't yet 
delved into it much yet, I think for many programs, the library docs will 
be enough.  The library needs to be improved and extended, but that will 
happen in time.

     We're dealing with a different market here.  Apple II companies 
simply cannot afford to seed large numbers of developers for free.  And 
after all the roadblocks I've hit just trying to get ANY programming

AUTOARK V1.1 IS FINALLY AVAILABLE FOR THE IIGS!   August 7th, 1995
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     EGO Systems is pleased (and relieved) to announce that version 1.1 of 
AutoArk is FINALLY shipping!

     If you've forgotten what AutoArk is (and who could blame you!), 
AutoArk  is a file compression utility that works behind the scenes to 
automatically compress and decompress files on your IIGS.  With AutoArk 
installed, you can compress the files that you rarely use and regain the 
use of much of the space on your hard drive.  When you need to use a 
compressed file, you don't have to run a separate utility, AutoArk will 
automatically decompress the file for you!  And, when you've finished with 
the file, AutoArk will automatically recompress the file for you!  (AutoArk 
also has the ability to password protect and encrypt any of your files!)

     With that refresher on AutoArk out of the way, let's look at what's 
new in version 1.1! 

- * - AutoArk is now 100% compatible with System 6.0.1 and the Finder. 
      Specifically, you can once again double-click on an AutoArk file and 
      it will be expanded and opened like it should be.  (The previous 
      version of AutoArk would re-compress the file before it could be 
      opened.)

- * - Lots of small internal bugs have been fixed.  This has given  AutoArk 
      a general improvement in overall compatibility and stability.  For  
      example, one of these bugs prevented you from using the ORCA/Shell 
      "edit"  command to edit a file that had been compressed with AutoArk.  
      This now  works like it should.

- * - Previous versions of AutoArk only re-compressed files when you 
      returned  to the Finder.  This proved to be inconvenient for users of 
      other program  launchers, like ProSel.  To fix this, AutoArk v1.1 
      lets the user specify a  "home" application.  When the user returns 
      to this home application, AutoArk  will recompress any files that 
      have been expanded.

- * - If you don't like the idea of AutoArk recompressing files while you 
      are  in ANY application, you can also set AutoArk v1.1 to wait until 
      you shut down  your computer before it begins to recompress its 
      files!

- * - The AutoArk new desk accessories have been enhanced to allow you to 
      compress or expand entire folders and all of their contents.

- * - AutoArk now has additional Inter-Process Communication facilities to 
      allow other programs to tell AutoArk to compress or expand a file.

- * - AutoArk v1.1 also comes with a new Finder extension, Smart Names, 
      that works with AutoArk v1.1 to automatically compress or expand 
      files simply by changing their names!  For example, if you have a 
      file named "Fred" and you change its name to "Fred.ark", Smart Names 
      will instantly tell AutoArk to compress the file!  If you delete the 
      ".ark" from the end of the filename, Smart Names will tell AutoArk to 
      expand the file!  And, if you set up a folder  with a name that ends 
      in ".ark" Smart Names will tell AutoArk to compress any  files that 
      you copy into that folder!  (If you have Balloon v2.0 installed,  
      Smart Names will work with it also!  Just use ".shk" instead of 
      ".ark" and  Smart Names will tell Balloon to compress the file!)

     The regular price of AutoArk v1.1 will be $35.  As with our other 
products, this price includes first class shipping to anywhere in the 
United States, Air Mail shipping to Canada and Mexico, and surface mail 
shipping to anywhere  else in the world.  (For Air Mail delivery outside 
North America, add $3, for  a total of $38.)  However, until October 31st 
1995, the price for AutoArk will be  only $30.  As an added bonus for new 
AutoArk purchasers, when you send in your  AutoArk registration card, we'll 
send you a free issue of GS+ Magazine!

     If you are a previous owner of AutoArk, the cost to upgrade will be 
$7.50 through October 31st, 1995.  After that, the cost to upgrade will be 
$10.  For more information, contact us at (615) 332-2087 or write to us at 
the address below.

     If you want to purchase AutoArk v1.1 and Balloon v2.0 at the same 
time,  we have a special deal on that too.  Through October 31st, 1995 the 
cost of the AutoArk & Balloon bundle is $45.  (You save $15.)  After 
October 31st, the cost will be $55.  (Balloon is a new desk accessory that 
lets you open, create and otherwise manipulate ShrinkIt archives from 
INSIDE any IIGS desktop program.  If you want more information on Balloon, 
just contact  us at by one of the means shown below.)

     To order AutoArk, give us a call at 1-800-662-3634 between 9 a.m. and 
5 p.m. Monday through Friday.  (Outside the United States, call 
615-332-2087.   We accept Visa and MasterCard for all phone orders.)  You

GS+ MAGAZINE CEASES PUBLICATION   Not a hoax!  Not a dream!  Not an 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   imaginary tale!  What follows is a 
slightly edited version of the "Writer's Block" column that will appear in 
the upcoming issue of GS+ Magazine (V7.N1 - which will be mailed out the 
week of August 28th).  Please distribute this information as far and wide 
as possible.

Writer's Block By Steven W. Disbrow   Believe it or not, I'm writing this 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   editorial while this issue of GS+ 
Magazine is at the printer.  This page is actually being substituted for 
the "Writer's Block" that I had already written for this issue.  So, what 
you read on this page will take precedence over some of the other 
information that you will find in this issue.  Why am I telling you this?  
It's because I've got some very bad news...

     It is with great sadness that I am forced to announce that this 
(V7.N1) is the last issue of GS+ Magazine.  After six years, and 
thirty-seven issues, it has simply become impossible to continue 
publication.

     As you might be able to guess, the main reason for this decision is 
money. Specifically, the lack of it.  As I mentioned an issue or two ago, 
renewals have been off.  Since then, renewals went through the floor and 
new subscriptions have been almost non-existent.  I've tried everything I 
could think of to reverse this trend, but nothing has worked.  The end 
result is that EGO Systems has no more money to publish GS+ Magazine.  So, 
I've reluctantly decided to pull the plug.

     I know what you are thinking, "Ha!  Now Diz will show his true colors 
and disappear like all the rest."  Well, I'm not gonna do that.  While GS+ 
Magazine is ceasing publication, EGO Systems will stick around for just as 
long as possible.  Specifically, we'll still be selling and supporting all 
of the back issues of GS+ Magazine, as well as our other Apple IIGS and 
Newton products.  We will also continue to sell Procyon's, Zip's, 
Animasia's and WestCode's products for just as long as there is a demand.  
Heck, we might even come out with some new stuff after the dust from this 
settles...

What About my Money?   Of course, if you're thinking ahead, you've figured 
''''''''''''''''''''   that, if there's no money to publish GS+ Magazine, 
there's probably no money left to repay your subscription.  Sadly, this is 
true.  But, that doesn't mean I don't intend to try.  It's been my 
intention since day one of GS+ Magazine to repay every penny of subscriber 
money, one way or another.  So, here's what we are going to do:

     First, check your mailing label.  If it says "<*Last Issue!*>" this 
was your last issue of GS+ Magazine, so you've gotten all the issues you've 
paid for.  (You can skip to the last paragraph if you want.)  Otherwise, 
your label will have a dollar amount and a volume & issue number on it. (It 
will look something like this:  "$30.00/V7.N6".)  This tells you how much 
credit you have in your account as well as when your subscription would 
have expired.

     To translate this last issue figure into an actual number of issues 
that you had coming to you, use the following table:

     V7.N2 = 1 issue     V7.N3 = 2 issues    V7.N4 = 3 issues
     V7.N5 = 4 issues    V7.N6 = 5 issues    V8.N1 = 6 issues
     V8.N2 = 7 issues    V8.N3 = 8 issues    V8.N4 = 9 issues
     V8.N5 = 10 issues   V8.N6 = 11 issues   V9.N1 = 12 issues.

[Note:  since you are reading this online, you probably don't have V7.N1 
yet, so you can't look at your mailing label to see how much credit you 
have.  Just give us a call at 615-332-2087 (please don't use the toll-free 
line for this!) and we can tell you.]

     After you figure out how many issues we owe you, you need to decide 
how you want to be repaid for those issues.  Here are the options we are 
making available at this time:

     1)  Back issues.  You can take back issues for unmailed issues on a 
"1 for 1" basis.  So, if you have five issues remaining, you can take five 
back issues.  Just send us a list of the ones you want.  (We'll pay the 
shipping.  I'm not sure HOW we'll pay the shipping at this point, but we're 
going to try.  If you'd like to throw in a little money [$3 would be a good 
amount] to help us pay for shipping, I won't complain!)

     2)  Out of print Back Issues.  If you have all of our available back 
issues, that first option might not appeal to you very much.  So, for the 
first time ever, I'm making available disks containing the text of our 
sold-out back issues.  Like regular back issues, you can take these on a "1 
for 1" basis.  So now you can have any GS+ Magazine back issue you want.  
We'll also pay the shipping on these.  (Here again, if you want to help us 
out on the shipping, I certainly won't pitch a fit!  And if you could send 
us some blank disks to copy the text onto, that would be GREAT! ;-} )

     3)  Use the credit that's shown on your label.  If you don't just 
want back issues, you can use your credit towards the purchase of anything 
we sell.  That includes AutoArk, Addressed For Success, GS+ T-Shirts 
(please!), Balloon, or any of the third party products we sell.  You can 
also use your credit to pay for multiple products, or to pay for shipping.  
You should figure shipping costs for the products you order as detailed in 
the ads in this issue.  If you don't have enough credit to cover everything 
you want to get, send us your Visa or MasterCard information, and we'll 
bill you for the difference.  You can also send us a check for the 
difference if you want, but it will be easier for us to bill an exact 
amount to a credit card.  By the way, if you want to use your credit to buy 
back issues, figure their cost using the costs shown on the back issue 
information page in this issue.  I realize it's more expensive that way, 
but it's just too much trouble for us to figure all the different costs 
involved.  (By the way, the special back issue offer detailed in the 
a.Read.Me file on the GS+ Disk is no longer valid.) 

     Remember, we aren't going out of business!  We are just stopping 
publication of GS+ Magazine.  So, I intend to do everything in my power to 
keep your trust.  (In other words, you needn't worry about sending us your 
credit card info.)

     This also means that we are retaining the copyrights to all of our 
programs and all of the back issues of GS+ Magazine.  So please, if you 
know someone that wants copies, don't make copies for them, just send them 
our way.

Special Notes   If you are a magazine and disk subscriber, you'll get 
'''''''''''''   magazines and disks.  If you are a magazine only 
subscriber, you'll just get magazines.  When a paper version of a back 
issue is gone, we'll switch to the disk-based text version.  If we don't 
have the T-shirt size you request, we'll substitute the next largest size.  
If you use your credit to order some of the third-party products that we 
sell, be sure to list alternate products that you want, just in case we are 
sold out of something and we can't get more!  (In fact, be sure to list 
lots of alternate products!)  Also, be sure to include a phone number (and 
the best time to call), or e-mail address that we can reach you at.

Expiration Date   Since we will probably have to move out of our offices 
'''''''''''''''   soon (I plan on taking EGO Systems back into my 
basement.), we need to get all of these back issues out of here as soon as 
possible.  So, this offer expires on October 31, 1995.  After that, I'll 
assume that you've taken pity on me and you've decided to let me keep your 
money.  (Not that I still have it...)  Frankly however, I'd much rather get 
rid of all these back issues!  Otherwise, they'll be going to the recycling 
plant on December 31!

     Finally, over the next several weeks I'm going to attempt to sell off 
quite a bit of our office and computer equipment.  The production of GS+ 
Magazine was the main thing that we used it all for, so we really don't 
need a lot of it any longer.  So, if you are looking for a particular piece 
of hardware or software, call me.  The only catch is that I'll ask you to 
pay the shipping.

     The Phones As I said earlier, EGO Systems is very cash poor at this 
moment.  However, I'm hopeful that this won't be the case forever, so the 
1-800 number is still in service.  Until then however, I'd like to ask that 
you not use the 1-800 number for calling to request your back issues or 
credit purchases.  Instead, call us at 615-332-2087, or FAX your order to 
us at 615-332-2634.  Better still, if you can, please e-mail your orders to 
me at GSPlusDiz@aol.com.  (Don't bother sending e-mail to my old Delphi 
account, I had to cancel it in a last ditch attempt to cut costs.  It 
didn't work.)

The End   Well, that's it then.  It's been a hard, but enjoyable six years.  
'''''''   There were times that I truly thought that it would last forever, 
but there were far more times that I just wanted to curl up in a little 
ball and cry.

     GS+ Magazine has always felt like my "baby."  But it certainly 
couldn't have been delivered by me alone.  So, I need to thank the 
following people for helping me to make GS+ Magazine a reality through the 
years

     First I need to thank my mom.  She loaned me the money I needed to 
get this whole thing going.  (And some day I might even pay her back!)

     Even though they weren't around long, Susan Thoeming, Wilma Tucker, 
Michelle Davidson and Bill Moore all deserve recognition for putting up 
with me for as long as they did.

     Michelle Ribaric deserves a huge thanks for getting GS+ Magazine on 
schedule and keeping it there.

     Thanks to Robert "Bob" Ribaric for making the workplace more fun and 
for doing all the tiny little crap jobs I could throw at him.  He never 
complained and always had a smile and a cheese joke for us when the day 
started.

     I've always thought of myself as the "Idea Man," but the truth is 
that Joe Wankerl had some great ideas himself.  It would be a lie if I were 
to tell you that I could have done GS+ Magazine without him.  He always met 
his deadlines and he never wrote a bad program.  In fact, I'd say that 
Joe's the best programmer that's ever touched an Apple II keyboard, bar 
none. Whatever platform he ends up on will be damn lucky to have him.  
Thanks for all your help Joe.

     That brings me to Nory...  People, if it weren't for this marvelous 
woman, there never would have even been a GS+ Magazine.  When I wanted to 
start this magazine, she was there with all the support any man could ever 
hope for.  She helped with editing, layouts, testing, accounting... you 
name it, she did it.  And, she never took a dime for any of the work she 
did.  She's been with GS+ Magazine from the beginning, and without her help 
and support, the end would have come much, much sooner.

     I love you Nory!

     Finally, of course, I have to thank all of you.  From our first 
customer (Mark DePeo Jr.), to our last, you guys have stood by GS+ Magazine 
through bad times and worse times.  You gave us your monetary and emotional 
support and we couldn't have done it without you.

     Thanks, and farewell.

HYPERCARD BOOKS   I explored some of the contractual issues behind APDA 
"""""""""""""""   with Uncle Tom at KansasFest this year, and to make a 
long story short, I can reprint the HyperCard manuals.  Now that I know I 
_can_, I need to decide if I _ _should_... and that's where you folks come 
in.

     If they are reprinted, the books will be laserprinted on 3 hole paper 
for notebooks.  You will need to supply your own notebook, although we can 
see about betting come for non-US customers, who may have trouble finding 
them in the correct size.

     There are 3 volumes, and of course the disks.  Here's the prices we 
will need to charge:

 APDA 48  Getting Started with HyperCard IIGS       156 pages   $15
 APDA 49  HyperCard IIGS Reference                  389 pages   $25
 APDA 50  HyperTalk Beginner's Guide IIGS           171 pages   $15
 APDA 51  HyperCard IIGS Disks                      6 disks     $20
 APDA 52  APDA 48-51 in a package                               $60

     It costs some money to set up the original masters, too, so what I 
need to know is whether you folks want these books, and want them bad 
enough to order them.  Here's how I will tell:

     You can order these books now by credit card.  You won't be charged 
right away.  If we get 10 orders, we'll put HyperCard back in print.  At 
that time, you'll be charged, and we'll start the reproduction process.  
About 2 weeks later, we'll ship your copies of HyperCard.

     If we don't get 10 orders, we won't put it back in print.

     Once it's back in print, it stays in print.  The cost for us is 
getting things set up and producing the originals for laserprinting; once 
that's done we can print manuals in very small numbers.

     If you would like to place an order for HyperCard, please do!  All of 
the normal contact and shipping apply; specifically:

     Shipping: $5 in US, shipping cost rounded to the next higher dollar

     If you order by mail and send a check, please use two checks--one for 
this product and one for everything else, so we won't have to cash the 
check to send what we have now!

NEW APDA PRODUCTS   Hopefully some of you have already seen the notice in 
"""""""""""""""""   Cat 19, Top 4 about the HyperCard manuals.  Here's the 
basic story:  The simple version of the APDA contract is that we can put 
pretty much any Apple II technical information back in print, so long as it 
was developed at Apple and published by Apple (i.e., not Addison-Wesley, 
darn it all).

     That's pretty broad, though.  It means we can put some classic as 
well as some useful stuff back in circulation.  Everything from the Red 
Book to the Apple //e Applesoft books to the Apple //e Reference Manual are 
fair game.

     So, if there's an Apple II publication you want to see available 
again, let me know.  If I can find a copy to use as a master, and there are 
at least 10 people interested in buying the product, we'll try to put it 
back in print.

     If you know of a product you'd like to see, send the name of the 
product to me, and watch GEnie or AOL for ordering information and 
announcements of ship dates.

<<<<<   I know some people like hearing things straight from the horses
"""""   mouth, but in a nutshell, all of the information you've seen is 
correct.  To summarize:

     1.  The 3 books I listed all came with HCIIGS 1.1.  They were all 
         with my copy.

     2.  The script guide is an Addison-Wesley book.  I can't reprint it.

     3.  There was a beta version of the GS/OS reference manual which was 
         printed by APDA.  It was officially pulled as an APDA product when 
         the Addison- Wesley book was printed.  We can't repring the 
         official Apple/Addison-Wesley version.  We can, of course, do our 
         own book and may do that at some point.  Right now, we're working 
         sporadically on a new version of the toolbox reference manuals.  
         When that's finished, and if it sells well enough to justify the 
         work, we'll consider the GS/OS reference, too.

     4.  I have no real hope of ever getting permission to reprint the 
         Addison-Wesley books.  As I understand it, that would take the  
         agreement of Apple Computer, Addison-Wesley, and some actual work 
         by Apple Licensing.  The chances of any one of those actually 
         happening are slim; the chances of all threehappening are so small 
         that I don't intend to put any effort into trying.  (I have tried 
         on past projects, so I sort of know what the reaction will be.)

     As of Saturday morning, the official tally was 3 HCIIGS Manual sets 
ordered. I have not checked my mail yet.  Once the number hits 10, we'll 
put them back in print.

     Thanks for all of your interest.  And by the way, I don't normally 
scan this area--once the HCIIGS issue dies down, I'll probably stop.  If I 
seem unresponsive, and you want an answer directly from me, try posing in 
Cat 45 here in A2 (which I scan several times a week) or in A2Pro Cat 36.

REVISED PC TRANSPORTER MANUAL?   Would anyone be interested in a new and 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   revised PCTransporter manual (AE has left 
alot of missing items in their manual that an independent update should 
occur).  The Update would include:

     1.  The advantages of MS-DOS v6.22, setting up it properly
     2.  Hidden secrets of the parallel port.
     3.  High-density access with the PCT via floptical, BlueDisk, and 
         Apple Superdrive.
     4.  A list of known programs that work with the PCT and are readily 
         available.
     5.  Possibly expanding the 640k barrier of PCT memory to 1meg.
     6.  Advantages of the 8087-2 math-coprocessor with the PCT
     7.  A Utilities Disk with important IBM freeware/shareware programs 
         that work great on the PCT.
     8.  Possible PCT bug fixes (not exactly updates)
     9.  Tips, hints, tricks, and troubleshooting the PCT.
     10. How to use the TRANSFER.EXE program to your advantage... and much 
         more...

     The Updated PCT manual is open to any suggestions (let me know what 
you would like in it besides the few items I've listed), and I will begin 
work on it in the following weeks to come if there is enough interest.
                 (S.LATELLA, CAT14, TOP12, MSG:47/M645;1)

>>>>>   -MORE AVAILABLE MEMORY WITH DOS 6.22
"""""
     Yup,  Dos 6.22 is a smaller version because some of the functions of 
the program have been moved out of COMMAND.COM, and placed as EXE files or 
have become part of other EXE files.  Overall, its better for PCT owners 
because it saves some memory.

-BE CAREFUL USING DOUBLESPACE FROM EARLY VERSIONS OF DOS6.0/6.2/6.21-

     Be very careful when using DoubleSpace with version 6.0/6.2/6.21. 
Doublespace was available with v6.0 but once you compressed a drive you 
couldn't uncompress it.  As for v6.2 it had the uncompress feature, but it 
wasn't stable.  So far it seems that v6.22 has all the bugs worked out.

-POSSIBLE CD-ROM SUPPORT WITH THE PCTRANSPORTER-

     I've been working on getting the PCTransporter to recognize a CD-ROM 
Drive, and everything looks really promising right now.  I haven't tested 
it out yet, because the CD-ROM Drive I ordered from Vitesse still hasn't 
arrived.

     Everything is one paper right now so it should work, but I can't 100% 
sure until I test it out.  If it does work then GS owners with a PCT will 
have access to a several more CDs.  I said several more because most CDs 
require having a Windows based system with a 386 machine as a minimum to 
run (and the PCT will is only an 8086 Dos System).  I've found several Dos 
based CDs, so they are still available, but you'll have to do some 
searching.

     Of course this will all be in the updated manual :)

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Phil Shapiro
   [P.SHAPIRO1]



    >>> ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS AND THE CHANGING NATURE OF FRIENDSHIP <<<
    """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Online communication is transforming how human beings interact with 
one another. 

     The nature of the medium is such that it helps people connect with 
others of similar interest.  So if you're interested in fly fishing and you 
live in Calgary, Alberta, online communications allows you to easily make 
contact with other fly fishing aficionados in other parts of the world.

     But say your interest in fly fishing centers around a particular 
aspect of the sport.  Suppose that your interest in fly fishing centers 
around building your own lures out of natural material.  You have nothing 
to say to fly fishing fans who don't build their own lures. And you have 
even less to say to fly fishing fans who build their lures out of man-made 
materials (heaven forbid). 

     The Internet allows you to zero in on just those people who share 
your own particular interest.  Without the Internet, you would have to 
settle for putting up with fly fishing enthusiasts in your own 
neighborhood.  The locals may or may not be people you'd like to spend a 
lot of time with.

     It's a good thing when people connect with others who share their 
interests. Society is formed by a web of individual human bonds.  The more 
individual bonds there are, the stronger the fabric of society.

     And every connection between human beings opens up new possibilities, 
new opportunities.  Is it not true that every advance ever made grew out of 
the interaction between two (or more) human beings?  Conversely, it would 
be fair to say that there is no human being alive now (or alive ever) who 
created something meaningful and lasting entirely on their own. 

     But what is really intriguing is that the nature of friendship is 
changing.  Friendship used to be a predominantly social things.  The new 
friendship blurs the boundary between friends and colleagues.

     A year or two ago I had an experience which got me thinking about the 
nature of online friendships (o-friendships).  The small software company I 
run had a news story written about it in Newsbytes, the online news service 
for international computer news.  It just so happened that this Newsbytes 
story contained a fairly significant factual error.

     This error was brought to my attention by an o-friend of mine who 
happened to spot the story an hour after it had been posted online.  Within 
two hours of the story being made public, I was able to explain the mistake 
to the reporter who wrote the story.  Newsbytes posted a formal correction 
the next day.

     What this experience taught me is the value of having o-friends 
looking out for your own interests.  The modern day world is far too 
complex for any individual to pay attention to all its myriad aspects.  But 
the more o-friends you have, the greater are the chances that you will be 
clued in to something that's of interest to you.

     Instead of having just one pair of eyes, online communications allows 
you to have a hundred pairs of eyes.  The extra pairs of eyes come in 
handy, I've come to learn.  People watch out for each other in brand new 
ways out here. 

     Since every friendship is based on mutuality, every act of friendship 
begets another act of friendship.  Mutuality is rife in the online world.  
It's rife and it's flourishing and it's coming soon to a disk drive near 
you.

     Remember the quaint old days when friends were people you used to 
spend time with in person?  Sure those friendships were great.  There's no 
denying that face-to-face friendships (ftf friendships) have a certain 
esthetic appeal.  But online friendships have far more promise in the 
larger scheme of things, precisely because they allow a bond to be formed 
based on genuine shared interest, rather than on a blurred blend of 
geographic proximity and general shared interest.

     Online communication magnifies the benefits of friendship.  The more  
people you know online, the more opportunities you will have to benefit 
from their particular knowledge and expertise. 

     If it's true that the more online contacts you have, the greater the 
overall benefits in your life, then it's just one extra step of logic to 
say that online communications tends to make people more sociable, more 
extroverted.

     There can be no denying that technology itself is changing how we 
relate to one another.  The effects of these changes are becoming 
increasingly apparent in the world around us.

     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!  This month we will take a look at 
a variety of things.

                                 [*][*][*]


18881  FNDRVIEW3.0.BXY  40k
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Finder-View 3.0 is a Finder Extension that works with the Finder in 
System Software 6.0 and later.  Finder-View is a joint effort.  The main 
program is written by Brian Clark; the 3200 color routines are by Mike 
Fleming; the $C2 animation routine is by Nate Trost and Mike Fleming; and 
the title screen and icons by Marco Busse.  I have lifted most of the 
following documentation from the help notes in the file, since the authors 
can explain what it does better than I can.

     Finder-View is, simply stated, a Finder invoked picture viewing 
program.  With version 3.0, you will no longer even have to leave the 
Finder to view pictures.  The file formats Finder-View v3.0 will handle 
are:

          PaintWorks Packed Picture
          Packed Super Hi-Res Screen Image
          Apple Preferred Format Picture
          Super Hi-Res Screen Image
          SHR 3200 Color Image (Brooks, French, and APF)
          PrintShop GS Color Graphic
          PaintWorks Animation   

     There are two methods of how to use Finder-View to view pictures.

     The first method is the most straightforward, and works well when you 
want to view only one or two pictures at a time.  Simply double-click on 
any picture's file icon.  You can select multiple file icons and still use 
this method, but the second method is more suitable for slide-showing 
multiple pictures.  

     In the second method, select the pictures you want to view, and then 
select the View Pictures... menu item from the Extras menu.  When using the 
second method, you will not be returned to the Finder screen between each 
picture, and you'll also be able to traverse both forward and backward 
through the slide-show as well as abort the slide-show at any time.     

     The command keys and actions that are available while a picture is 
being displayed are:

KEYS:

     Numerical keypad keys 1-9          - Picture movement
     CapsLock or Holding Open-Apple     - Multiply movement rate by 5
     Escape or Open-Apple-period        - Abort slide-show
     Return or '-->'                    - Move forward in slide-show
     '<--'                              - Move backward in slide-show
     Space                              - Pauses slide-show
     'I' OR 'i' key                     - Present picture information
     '+' key                            - Speed up animation
     '-' key                            - Slow down animation

MOUSE:

     Movement                           - Picture movement
     Button click                       - Move forward in slide-show

     There are a couple preference settings in Finder-View that let you 
choose how the program should operate in certain instances.  The 
preferences dialog is displayed any time the Finder-View... menu item is 
selected from the Extras menu.  The state of Finder-View's menu item 
changes based on what icons are selected.  If any files or folders are 
selected, the menu item will read View Pictures....  Otherwise, you'll be 
presented with the menu item to allow you to display the preferences 
dialog.  The preferences available are:

Slide-Show Seconds - Choose how many seconds to wait between pictures 
''''''''''''''''''   during a slide-show.

Auto Slide-Show - If this is checked, Finder-View will automatically 
'''''''''''''''   progress through the selected pictures.  All the regular 
action commands are still available.  The slide-show timer is reset if you 
scroll the picture, pause and unpause the slide-show, or bring up the 
picture information dialog.

Launch Application First - If this is checked, Finder-View will let the 
''''''''''''''''''''''''   Finder try to launch any application that may be 
linked to the picture file icons instead of displaying the picture.  The 
Control key can be used while double-clicking to change this preference 
setting on the fly.

Handle 3200's - If this is checked, Finder-View will display 3200 color 
'''''''''''''   pictures.  This option is present because the displaying of 
3200 color pictures may cause problems in a networked enviornment.     

     Finder-View is ShareWare.  To legally use Finder-View, you must send 
a $10 payment to Jupiter Systems within 2 weeks, otherwise you should 
delete it. The address given in the documentation is:

          Jupiter Systems
          P.O. Box 1396
          Barrington, IL  60010   U.S.A.

     Finder-View v3.0 is a Finder Extension and should be placed in your 
System:System.Setup folder.  Finder-View will become active the next time 
you boot.

22096  VOLUMESNAKE.BXY  25k
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This "Volume Snake" utility by Dan Jones will print all files on all 
subdirectories on one volume (or even for all volumes).  It will run on a 
64K machine.  The output can be directed to the screen, your printer, or a 
file.

     Run it, and tell it where you want the results.  Then tell it which 
slot and which drive to check and it will list a catalog of all the files 
located there.

                                 [*][*][*]


23871  SLOTSCAN162.BXY  13k
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This program by Robert Claney will tell you what kind and version of 
Apple II computer you have and tells you how much "normal" memory you have.  
What gives this program its name though is the fact that it scans your 
computer's slots and/or ports, telling you what is present in each one.  It 
will describe in detail the individual devices attached to SmartPort cards 
or ports, and SCSI cards which may be in your system.  It will identify the 
capacity of any drives which are supported by ProDOS.  This program will 
run on any computer which will run ProDOS.

     SlotScan includes extensive documentation to help you to get the most 
out of it.

206680 DOS33.LNCHR.BXY  40k
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This utility allows you to store and run older DOS 3.3 software on 
your previously non-DOS 3.3 compatible ProDOS hard drive or 3.5" floppy 
drives.  Version 2.0 now works with 8-bit Apple IIs!  It also now allows 
saving to disk images, and making double-sided disk images on the Apple 
IIgs.

     Written by the author of Roger Wagner's The Graphic Exchange, John 
MacLean, this is a $10 shareware utility.  It's very easy to use, and it 
even has the ability to slow down your system to 1 Mhz when running DOS 3.3 
software, but returns you to your launcher at full fast speed.  Supports 
DOS 3.3 BIN files and single or double sided DOS 3.3 disks.

     I am not personally familiar with this utility, but Tim's 
recommendation makes this an interesting utility to get.  [Your editor 
recommends it, too.--Ed.]

24324  QUIKVIEW1.1.BXY   9k
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is an update for Mark Munz's freeware AppleWorks word processor 
file viewer program.  This version displays AppleWorks 5.0 inverse 
uppercase characters correctly.  It was updated by Christian Serreau.

     If you don't have AppleWorks 5, and you need to view word processing 
files created with it, this is a handy utility.  [We recommend it for 
reading the AppleWorks version of GEnieLamp A2.--Ed.]

17717  SHR.VIEW3.5.BXY  23k
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     SHR View 3.5 was written by Ron Mercer, the author of Emerald 
Visions' 3200 color paint program and the commercial program Prism.  This 
little program acts as a slideshow viewer for all SHR graphics, 3200 color 
pics, and even large GIFs.  According to the documentation, graphics up to 
4096x4096 are supported, though Lunatic, the uploader, had problems with 
some 1024x800 GIFs.  All GIFs are displayed in 16 shades of grey.

     According to the docs, this viewer supports the following image types:

$C0 Paintworks 1.0                   $C1 Raw Image Data (Screen Pic)
$C0 PackBytes                        $C1 3200 Color Screen
$C0 Apple Preferred                  $C1 Allison Raw Data
$C0 Apple Preferred 3200
$C0 Apple Preferred 3200+            $C2 Paintworks Animation
$C0 Paintworks Gold 640
$C0 3200 Colors (New)

BIN French APP 3200 Colors           BIN/TXT GIF87a
BIN Hi-Res                           BIN/TXT GIF89a
BIN Double Hi-Res (single file)
BIN 3200 Color Screen
BIN ComputerEyes IIgs Raw Data (old)

$F8 PrintShop GS

     This neat little program is shareware.  The author asks for a small 
fee of $10-$20. His address is included in the docs.

     According to the docs, the main purpose of this program is to view 
all of the images in the current prefix (directory/folder).  SV doesn't 
physically have to be in the directory with the images that are to be 
displayed.  By following this example you can have it in one directory 
while displaying images in another:

     SHR View is located in the directory "/HARD2/UTIL".
     The images are located in the directory "/HARD2/GRAPHICS/PICS.3200"

        ]prefix /hard2/graphics/pics.3200
        ]-/hard2/util/shr.view

        <that's it!>

     From GS/OS, you will probably want to have this program in each of 
your graphics directories so you can just double-click on it to view all of 
your pics without having to go into BASIC and play around with the prefix.

                                 [*][*][*]


     This edition of the Treasure Hunt will be my last.  It's not that 
there aren't a lot more treasures available in the Apple II library; it's 
just that I must cut back on the amount of time that I devote to writing 
for GEnieLamp A2.

     I'll be around from time to time with something for you whenever I 
get the chance.

     I want to thank Doug Cuff for giving me the opportunity to write for 
the Lamp.  It has been a delightful experience.

                              Until later...

     PROGRAM:  FAXination
     VERSION:  0.1.5
      AUTHOR:  Steven McQueen
   PUBLISHER:  Vitesse Inc, P.O. Box 929, La Puente, CA 91747-0929
       PRICE:  $79.95
REQUIREMENTS:  Apple IIgs, System 5.0.4 or later, 1.5 megabytes RAM,
               hard disk drive, external fax/modem


                                 [*][*][*]

     A fax (short for facsimile) machine is a combination of a modem and a 
digitizing scanner, with built-in software, or "firmware".  The firmware 
can encode and decode (image into data; data into image) and can send and 
receive data across a phone line.  You always need two fax machines... one 
to send and one to receive.

     There's a special kind of a modem called a fax/modem that can 
communicate with fax machines (in addition to its normal telecommunications 
functions).  It pretends to be a standalone fax machine.  A fax/modem can 
persuade the fax machine that it's okay to accept the data that the 
fax/modem sending, or that the fax machine can begin to send its data now.

     Fax/modems are nothing new.  The modems need software in order to 
work, though.  Nothing new there, either.  What is new?  Fax software for 
the Apple II; specifically, FAXination from Vitesse.

     FAXination sets out to let you do three main things:  create faxes, 
send them, and receive them.  It also lets you view faxes on the screen, 
and print them on a printer.

     FAXination comes in two parts:  a New Desk Accessory and a printer 
driver.  The New Desk Accessory allows you to send and receive faxes, as 
well as view and print them.  The printer driver is necessary only to 
create new faxes.

     To create a fax, you go to the Apple menu of any desktop-based IIgs 
program and select "Control Panels", a process familiar to most of you.  
From that menu, you select "DC Printer", and change the "printer type" 
_from_ ImageWriter or whatever other device you normally use, _to_ 
FAXination.  Then you tell whatever application you're using (for example, 
Teach or AppleWorks GS or GraphicWriter III) to open a document and print a 
copy of that document.  The application prints not to a printer but to a 
file.  FAXination will be using that file shortly.

     When printing the document, you have the option of setting the 
resolution at either 100 dots per inch (fast but not much detail) or 200 
dots per inch (slow but greater detail).  You also have the option of 
having the document sent as soon as the printing is finished, or sending it 
manually later.

     Once you've printed the document and created a fax file for 
FAXination, you can set the printer device back to your normal printer, if 
you like.  It really doesn't matter if you do this or not... as long as you 
remember to change it back before you want to print something!

SENDING A FAX   With the fax file safely on disk, you should pull down the 
"""""""""""""   Apple menu again and choose FAXination from the list of 
NDAs.  The FAXination NDA gives you six options:

          o  Receive log;
          o  Send log;
          o  Receive fax;
          o  Phone book;
          o  Local station ID; and
          o  FAXination options.

     When you select "Send log", FAXination shows you what fax files it 
has waiting to send.  You can select one with the mouse, then send it, view 
it on the screen, or print it to the printer.  You can also delete it, or 
address it.

     When you view a fax, only a part of it will fit on the screen at a 
time.  You have to use the scroll bars to slide various parts of the fax 
into the viewing window.  This allows you to see details of the fax 
clearly.  A chance to get an overview would be nice, too, but FAXination 
doesn't allow it.  Note that you cannot change a fax file as you view it.  
Once a fax file has been created, the only way to change it is to use your 
application to make the changes, then "print" it again.

     When you print a fax (you didn't forget to change the Direct Connect 
printer in the Control Panels, did you?), you may be a little distressed at 
the fuzziness of the image on an ImageWriter II.  For a fax you're sending, 
this doesn't matter very much, since the limitation in resolution is due to 
your printer and its printer driver, not FAXination.  In other words, the 
fax won't appear that fuzzy to the person who receives it.  Unfortunately, 
the same limitation applies to printing faxes you receive.  Unless you have 
an inkjet or laser printer, you may have to both print _and_ view a fax 
you've received in order to decipher it all, since the printed version 
gives you an overview and the onscreen version gives you sharper detail.  
If you do have an inkjet or laser printer, you're more likely to be 
satisfied with the FAXination printout.

     When you click on Send, FAXination sets up your fax/modem for 
transmission, and dials the number you assigned to it on the "envelope".  
Unfortunately, what is supposed to happen then is a mystery to this 
reviewer.  I was utterly unable to get FAXination to send a fax to anyone, 
despite three different fax machines and numerous tries.  I couldn't 
shift-boot to eliminate all Desk Accessories and Inits, since FAXination 
itself is an NDA, so I trimmed my active DAs and Inits as follows:

     Temporary Init           ZipInit
     ''''''''''''''
     New Desk Accessories     Control Panels
     ''''''''''''''''''''     FAXination

     CDEVs                    Direct Connect Printer
     '''''
     File System Translators  Pro.FST
     '''''''''''''''''''''''  Char.FST

     Drivers                  RAM5
     '''''''                  AppleDisk3.5
                              Console.Driver
                              Printer
                              Modem
                              RamFAST
                              FAXination

     That didn't help, either.  In short, I absolutely could not get 
FAXination to send a fax.  This was particularly discouraging, since I had 
received Vitesse's special hardware/software bundle of a 14.4 modem and a 
copy of FAXination (priced at $189.95).  I badly wanted FAXination to work 
for me, and I thought by ordering the modem that Vitesse themselves were 
selling, I'd avoid the proverbial vicious circle of the software publisher 
blaming the hardware manufacturer, and so on ad infinitum.

RECEIVING A FAX   After admitting defeat in my inability to send a fax, I 
"""""""""""""""   moved on to the part that was really important to me.  
After all, as a GEnie user, I can use their fax service to at least send 
ASCII-only fax messages.  What I was really looking forward to was the 
ability to receive faxes from others.

     FAXination's Receive Log menu offers you the chance to view, print, 
or delete a fax you've already received.  To actually receive a fax, you 
can either select "Receive Fax" from the FAXination NDA's menu when the 
phone rings--in effect saying "Hey, get that, will you?"--or you can select 
"Auto Receive" from the "FAXination Options" menu, which allows FAXination 
to receive a fax "in the background"... that is, FAXination will answer all 
incoming calls, even if you happen to be typing a letter in AppleWorks GS 
at the time.

     Unfortunately, I didn't have any success in receiving faxes in either 
mode.  So I can't tell you any more about the process.

THE MODEM BUNDLE   As I've said, I was shipped the hardware/software 
""""""""""""""""   bundle.  Apart from the FAXination disk and manual, it 
included a high-speed modem cable and a 14.4EFX external data fax modem 
that seemingly doesn't have a brand name.  Other GEnie users tell me it's 
an Aspen modem.  I can't verify this, but that's what they say, for 
whatever that's worth.

     As I've also said, I decided on the bundle to avoid problems.  That 
was a mistake.  This is a very cheap modem.  It's the smallest modem I've 
ever seen:  it's not as long as two 3.5" disks laid side by side.  It's 
only slightly wide than a 3.5" disk.  It's as thick as a stack of 6 disks.  
The first modem I received was clearly defective.  The second modem would 
not connect at all, so I put it away in a box for several months.  I took 
it out again this August, and to my surprise, it sort of worked!  I could 
connect to the local GEnie line at 2400 baud, and to the local university 
line at 14,400 baud.  (I was not able to connect to a local BBS, no matter 
what speed I tried.)

     It's just barely possible (I'm trying to give Vitesse every break I 
possibly can, for reasons that will shortly become apparent) that the Aspen 
modem doesn't get along well with Bell Canada.  Another Canadian purchaser 
of the bundle was heard to complain of symptoms similar to mine.  So it's 
unlikely but possible.

SUPPORT   Let's turn to a more pleasant topic:  support from Vitesse.  I've 
"""""""   found it to be just fine, thank you... within certain limits.

     The first modem I received in my hardware/software bundle was 
evidently no good.  It would not dial unless I lifted the receiver of my 
telephone as I issued the dial command.  When I made them aware of the 
problem, Vitesse replaced the modem as promptly as international post and 
customs would allow.

     Vitesse has been providing updates of FAXination to registered owners 
on its BBS.  As this is in California, it is prohibitively expensive for me 
to call from here in Canada.  This, frankly, is a little galling.  "Having 
to pay to be a beta tester," one GEnie customer called it.  Since my bundle 
was a Christmas present, and since I'm every bit as poor as you would 
expect a freelance editor and writer to be, I resented the perceived 
implication that anyone with anyone money to buy the software in the first 
place has sufficient expendable income to pay for support.

     To their great credit, when I E-mailed Vitesse here on GEnie, and 
pointed out this expense, they sent me an updated version via E-mail (using 
GEnie's "File-mail" option).  Why on earth they don't ask for a private 
library in A2Pro is beyond me, but at least Vitesse is doing something.

DOCUMENTATION   The documentation is fair.  It gets points for being clear.  
"""""""""""""   Its overview tells you the history of faxing--beginning in 
1843--in two pages, which is nice, but largely irrelevant.

     One big problem is that the manual is organized from the point of 
view of a programmer--introduction, installation, NDA, printer driver, 
status dialog, and technical support--rather than a user--creating a fax, 
sending a fax, receiving a fax, printing, viewing, address book, and so on.  
Chapter 5, The FAXination Status Dialog, provides an important clue to 
"what's wrong with this picture".  It has just four paragraphs (three of 
which are one sentence long).  The first paragraph is this self-evident 
sentence:  "The FAXination status dialog is simply a dialog that indicates 
that status of a transmission."  Apparently, a equals a!  I think they call 
this the reflexive axiom, fellas.  This would be the ideal point to list 
the possible messages in the dialog (particularly since this reviewer got 
to see only two, "Dialing" and "Establishing Connection").

     Overall, though, the manual is adequate.  To its great credit, it 
only puns on "fax/facts" once.

SUMMARY   FAXination doesn't work, at least not for me.  No way, nohow.  
"""""""   This is almost certainly because it was released too soon.  
Notice that the version number, 0.1.5, indicates a pre-release version.  
(Version 0.1.6 has been released by now, but I've heard no word of version 
1.0.)

     Because I wasn't able to get FAXination either to receive or send a 
fax, it's difficult for me to comment on it in detail.  Others have 
reported limited success, but I have not heard anyone say they got it to 
work, first crack out of the box.  (Indeed, a friend of mine also bought 
FAXination, and has had no luck getting it to work with his IIgs and his 
LineLink 144e modem.)

     I recommend you wait for a stable and reliable version of FAXination 
before buying.  If you're the adventuresome type and would like to give 
FAXination a try, I'll see you my copy, bundled with the Aspen 14.4 modem, 
for less than half price.  No kidding.

RATING
""""""
   (_|_)            It is with some reluctance that I award FAXination the

            ~ GEnieLamp Profile:  John Van Dam, a/k/a Froggie ~

     This month we are featuring John Van Dam, a frequent visitor to the 
Apple II RoundTable Bulletin Board.  John is better known as Froggie, and 
all of us in the bulletin board enjoy his ASCII art signatures immensely.

     Although Froggie has been visiting the bulletin board for less than a 
year, he has made his presence felt with timely tips and advice in a wide 
range of subjects.  We feel certain that you will enjoy this interview.


GEnieLamp>   John, you are known online for your unique ASCII art 
"""""""""    signatures depicting a frog. What made you decide to use this 
signature?
       _   _
      (o)-(o)
     (   _   )        In my first grade class in school, there were FIVE
__ooo_)_____(_ooo__   boys named John in the same room, so a nickname
"""""""""""""""""""   seemed imperative when I logged on to GEnie.  I had 
to change my GEnie address because I was assigned J.VANDAM.  One of my 
major peeves has always been that there MUST be a space in "Van Dam" and 
this has been a major battle over the years. :-(  I realized that I needed 
to do this before I started posting, to avoid later confusion.

     I work at frogdesign, inc and everybody who works there are known 
affectionally as "frogs".  Even earlier, in high school my changing, often 
croaking voice, blonde hair and glasses led to the appellation "froggie" 
after the famous member of Our Gang.  My choice of address was fairly easy 
with that history.  Online communication has an inherent tendency to be 
terse and impersonal, so I wanted something that would help define the tone 
of my messages.  I had no idea if I could even make an ASCII frog, but I 
gave it a go one night.  He seemed kinda cute, so I began posting him in my 
messages despite online concerns about using elaborate sigs.  I wasn't sure 
how elaborate was too elaborate.  The frog was greeted kindly, and has 
apparently gained his own fan club of sorts.  Someone actually said that I 
didn't post him often enough :-)

GEnieLamp>   Your frogs have certainly caught on in the Apple II Bulletin
"""""""""    Board.  We will feature some of them throughout this article.

     Are computers a part of your daytime job?  Please tell us a little 
about what you do between 9 and 5.

      (o)-(o)
     (   _   )        I use several platforms at work.  Macs, PeeCees, SGIs
__ooo_)_____(_ooo__   (Unix), and two different machine tool controllers.
"""""""""""""""""""   I am a professional modelmaker for a leading 
industrial design firm.  It is a German company which was contracted by 
Steve Jobs at Apple to create a design language for them, starting with the 
IIc.  We did the NeXT computer, the new Packard Bell design, Motorola 
Envoy, ATT/EO personal communicator, and a new design language for a PeeCee 
company that should make quite a splash when it's released very soon.  
Everything I work on is very confidential, so it's good that I'm =not= a 
PeeCee user in the IBM RT, or I'd be biting my tongue all the time.  Ouch!

     I've built models ranging from toothbrushes to supercomputers, and 
everything in between, usually full-size.  I usually build appearance 
models (that is, no electronics, etc), but I also make working models and 
prototypes.  Most people don't realize my profession exists, which in a way 
is a nice compliment.  The public sees models all the time without 
realizing it.  The pictures found on product packaging are usually photos 
of models for two reasons:  1) The models look better, being hand-made for 
that purpose rather than mass-produced; 2) If they waited until the product 
came off the assembly line to photograph it, then print up the boxes, then 
put the product in the boxes, THEN ship it, production schedules would be a 
nightmare.

GEnieLamp>   What caused you to go into modelmaking?
"""""""""
       _   _       
      (o)-(o)      
     (  ,_,  )        Good question... most of the modelmakers I know
__ooo_)_____(_ooo__   started out in a different vocation.  I trained as a
"""""""""""""""""""   drafter and found out about modelmaking when an 
instructer from another college gave a slide presentation to my drafting 
class.  I immediately realized I was heading the wrong way... I didn't want 
just to draw the parts, I wanted to build the parts.  It seems obvious in 
retrospect, because object visualization was what had always intrigued me.  
An idea is the spark, but bringing that ideal form into reality is the 
challenge.

     Modelmaking provides that in a big way.  It is a renaissance art, 
involving design, materials science, fabrication, purchasing, color 
matching, painting, etc.  In my field, which is basically R&D modelmaking, 
we rarely make more than one of whatever we're building.  Every project is 
radically different, and the deadline is usually less than two weeks, 
sometimes two hours, often at a moment's notice.  This goes well with my 
short attention span and the urge to be doing several different things at 
once :-)

GEnieLamp>   What sorts of things do you like to do for fun (i.e.
"""""""""    non-computer hobbies)?

necessarily in that order.

GEnieLamp>  What is your favorite Star Trek episode/movie? Why?
"""""""""

Froggie>   That's a tough one.  There are so many great ones, I'd almost
"""""""    have to pick one for every character...

     If I had to choose one, I think it would be DARMOK (season 5, episode 
2).  This episode takes place at El'A'Drel where Picard encounters Captain 
Dathon, member of a race whose language is metaphoric in structure.  
"Darmok and Jelad at Tanagra" refers to mythical characters who meet at a 
place called Tanagra, fight a common foe, and become good friends.  Captain 
Dathon is hoping the same will happen between him and Picard.

     This episode shows the Enterprise crew struggling with the Starfleet 
database, trying to locate and make sense of the historical archives, 
something every GEnie A2 user can appreciate.  I've always been fascinated 
with different forms of communication, whether it is in the form of 
drawings, other languages, secret codes, and this episode illustrates the 
struggle to impart the internal imagery one has to another person very 
effectively, IMHO.

     I also appreciated that in DARMOK, the bridge crew suffers a critical 
misunderstanding of the situation, and in trying to rescue Picard, may have 
contributed to the demise of poor Captain Dathon.  Even Picard wasn't 
getting any breaks this time.  After saving the universe with seconds to 
spare on countless occasions, it was refreshing to see the Enterprise crew 
baffled throughout the encounter, with only a glimmer of understanding at 
the end of the episode.

GEnieLamp>   How did you first get interested in the Apple II computer?
"""""""""

Froggie>   About 1983, I went to a party and the host had an Apple II.  I
"""""""    remember playing Castle Wolfenstein on it.  The seed was 
planted, though I didn't realize it at the time.  About 1986, my sister's 
boyfriend at the time was the son of an Apple engineer, and they had a IIc 
system at their house.  When I went to visit them, she did an Appleworks 
demo for me.  Then she showed me this dungeon game which displayed a 
perspective view down the corridor.  I spent the weekend playing that game.  
Still, I resisted.

     Then I became a modelmaker and saw a CNC mill which cut really cool 
shapes by computer and I discovered that computers can give a person the 
freedom to accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible or 
impractical, and I finally got the computing bug. One day, I asked my boss 
if I could buy one of the IIc computers that were in storage.  She said 
they were needed for the archives, and instead just gave me a IIe system.  
I was elated!  Later I came to appreciate that the IIe was the right choice 
for me.  Now I can't imagine owning a computer without lots of slots :-)

GEnieLamp>   Do you have any anecdotes you can share with us about your
"""""""""    first experiences with the Apple II?

Froggie>   That first IIe ignited my latent hacker tendencies.  I quickly
"""""""    learned that it was a rev. A motherboard in a prototype IIe 
case.  After a logic board upgrade, I was set.  Until the gremlins hit.  
One day, while playing Montezuma, my poor little guy just kept jumping up 
and down uncontrollably.  Hmmm, joystick?  Nope.  It also happened without 
any joystick attached.  Later, using Yo-Yo Duck [utilities], I discovered 
quite by accident that if I lifted the front of the IIe an inch or two, the 
"button" would stop being pressed.  I took it to the dealer, they scratched 
their heads, swapped the board for free, and the problem remained.  I was 
bummed.  No games!!??

     By this time I had gotten a second IIe for my daughter, so I took 
them both apart and began swapping components determined to find and fix 
the problem.  I was on my own now.  Even the dealer couldn't help me.  I 
finally discovered that the power supply was going bad.  I replaced the 
power supply and the joystick button problem was fixed.  It was then I 
learned that computers aren't cold, calculating, unfeeling machines.  They 
are talented, twisted, and need to be nurtured and understood for the 
relationship to be successful.  Now I have two IIgs computers, and our 
whole family loves them.  They are part of the family.  I'd sell my cats 
before I'd sell my GSes.

GEnieLamp>   Describe your current hardware setup for us.
"""""""""
       ,,,,,
      (b)-(d)
     (   _,  )        We've got two "Woz" ROM 01 IIgs computers at home.
__ooo_)_____(_ooo__   They both have RamFAST SCSI cards.  The main GS has a
"""""""""""""""""""   240MB and a 40MB hard drive, 2x CD-ROM drive, 
Bluedisk with two 1.44meg drives, one Apple 3.5 drive, one Apple IIc 5.25 
drive, extended keyboard, TurboMouse, System Saver, 4.25MB RAM, ZIP 8/64, 
Soundmeister hooked up to my stereo system, Grappler+ parallel interface 
hooked to a DeskJet 500c inkjet printer, and a 15" SVGA monitor w/Second 
Sight card.

     The other GS has a 20MB hard drive, Quickie scanner, 1.75MB RAM,1 MB 
Ramfactor, RGB monitor, standard keyboard, TurboMouse, and lots of room for 
expansion.  I'm planning on getting a Bluedisk setup for this GS, and I've 
also got my eye on one of those new Syquests.

GEnieLamp>   What do you see as the future for the Apple II and its owners?
"""""""""

Froggie>   I feel that the Apple II is a mirror of its owner.  The whole
"""""""    concept of the Apple II is adaptability, versatility, and 
expandability.  The sky was the limit and still is....  We went to the moon 
using computers less powerful than the IIgs, yet the true limits of the 
Apple II are defined by our own limitations.  I think the success/failure 
of products like Second Sight and BlueDisk will say a lot about the future 
of the Apple II.  Are we willing to take risks, adapt and find new and 
innovative uses for our computers, or do we just want to play it safe?

     To me, the Apple II is like a classic roadster.  You really need to 
know what's going on under the hood, and the local dealer isn't going to be 
much help beyond trying to sell you a new [computer].  You need to find 
fellow enthusiasts who share your interest, where you can benefit from 
others experience and likewise offer assistance.  It may not be the newest, 
the fastest, or the most expensive, but the ride is an unforgettable 
experience, the distillation of a moment in time when an assembly of parts 
becomes pure poetry in motion.  Can you imagine someone telling you to give 
up your '36 coupe and buy a new Lexus?  You might end up with both, but 
give up the coupe... never!

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   enough for many people to realize it yet.  
Right now, it's just old.  My dad still talks about the classic cars he has 
owned, wishing he had kept them.  My Apple II is one classic that isn't 
going to get away!


GEnieLamp>   Can you offer some advice about software and hardware that a
"""""""""    new Apple II user might want to invest in?  What do you have 
and use?

Froggie>   Get a hard drive, and software to manage it.  I've got
"""""""    ProSel-16, Universe Master, UtilityWorks and I also want to get 
the Salvation series by Vitesse.  One utility just can't do it all, but 
together they've saved me on countless occasions.  A modem and a GEnie 
account are a must.  I sure could have used a lot of help when I first 
started out, and all of that assistance is available right here in A2!  
System 6.0.1 is another requirement.  I would also recommend a Softdisk 
subscription, and for IIgs users a GS+ magazine/disk subscription.  A lot 
of people seem to think it's only for programmers, but they've produced 
some absolutely indispensible programs, whatever the skill level.  Oh, and 
get a fan like a Kensington System Saver to keep your system cool and 
long-lasting.  Beyond that, whatever you can afford... there is a lot of 
great stuff available, it just depends on your interests.

                 PAUG NEWSLETTER /
/////////////////////////////////
September 1995 Report
"""""""""""""""""""""
by David R. Kerwood
        [D.KERWOOD]



     The mission of the Planetary Apple User's Group (PAUG) is to serve as 
the online heart of the worldwide Apple II Community.  PAUG's goals include 
providing help and support for folks who may not have a local group nearby, 
and to create a virtual link between both the online and offline user group 
community.  PAUG sponsorship of an online user group is focused on 
promoting the fact that the Apple II is still alive, and doing very well.

     There _is_ support; PAUG can provide it, or help you find it!  We 
meet the third Sunday of every month at 7:00 P.M. Eastern in the Apple II 
RoundTable Real Time Conference area.  With no dues to pay or miles to 
drive, PAUG offers the Apple II user a friendly and comfortable association 
with others with similar computing interests, plenty of accurate 
information, hints, tips, and the security that comes with knowing that you 
have all the computing support you could possibly need right at your 
fingertips.  What could be more convenient?

THE MAIN EVENTS   In our last newsletter we briefly described the 
"""""""""""""""   history of PAUG, and some of the more significant goings 
on since this virtual user group came about.  Since that time, the Apple II 
user community has seen quite a bit of activity, with perhaps one of the 
high points being the KansasFest celebration this past July.  If you are 
able to read this newsletter, then you have probably already heard enough 
about KFest to last you till next year, so we won't rehash anything from 
that.

     Central to the philosophy of what this user group should be about 
(helping others with similar interests to get the most out of their Apple 
II computers) has been a resurgence of interest in increasing the 
capability and utility of these machines.  The online PAUG community has 
been right there in the thick of things, testing new setups, reporting 
results and, most importantly, helping others to get the most out of their 
systems.  The theme of this edition of the PAUG newsletter will be how we 
have been helping Apple II online users in upgrading, repairing, and 
enhancing their favorite machines, often at an amazingly low cost.


"YOU CAN'T DO THAT ON AN APPLE II!"?   As mentioned above, the KansasFest
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   social festivities were not the only 
thing of interest in the Apple II universe this summer.  The hottest things 
happening online have been on the hardware front, with several items of 
high interest that have sparked the online and user group communities.  
First among these was that the distribution of Sequential Systems' Second 
Sight VGA video board finally went into high gear.  Designed for use on the 
Apple IIgs or IIe, it is an expansion card that allows the use of 
relatively inexpensive VGA or Super VGA monitors, or will even accommodate 
the standard IIgs Applecolor RGB monitor up to a resolution of 640x400, 
with 256 colors.

     This card has piqued the interest of many, particularly so since many 
of the monitors originally purchased for the IIe and IIgs are nearing the 
end of their useful lives.  So it has arrived upon the scene in just the 
nick of time for many Apple II users, who were getting tired of dim and 
fuzzy displays, or who simply wanted to enhance their existing setups.  
PAUG members (if you have a GEnie account, then YOU are a member!) have 
been most active in buying, installing, testing, and critiquing the various 
ways the Second Sight card can be used.  We have forwarded our findings to 
the developers, who are working on a user-installable ROM upgrade to the 
card which will further enhance its already formidable capabilities.  Most 
importantly, we have been working with the online community in assisting 
with installation, answering questions, and otherwise providing information 
to help the Apple II user make an informed purchasing decision. 

     So, if you have a need to know anything and everything about the 
Second Sight VGA video card, then drop by during any of our Real Time 
Conferences (RTC) each evening, or read the messages in the Second Sight 
topic in the A2 Roundtable, Category 20, Topic 14 (Sequential Systems 
Online - Second Sight VGA Card).

     One other bugaboo which has frequently vexed Apple II users has been 
the question of what to do with all those disks we keep getting from AOL.  
For many Apple II'ers these disks present limited utility beyond being a 
coaster, due to the fact that they are High Density disks.  While it is 
possible to reformat these to the standard 800K floppy, differences in the 
media between regular 800K disks and the 1.44 MByte floppies add some 
additional risk, as far as the integrity of your archived data are 
concerned.

     There have been several solutions to this problem, starting with 
Apple's own high density Superdrive unit.  This drives requires an 
additional controller card, which is no longer available from Apple.  It 
was recently noted in the A2 Roundtable that another supplier may step in 
to fill this void, that being ABC Direct (800-800-3630).  PAUG members have 
been in contact with the CEO, David Hardaway (formerly with Applied 
Engineering, RIP), in an effort to get an ABC Direct presence online in the 
A2 RT.  We'll keep you informed of any progress.

     Another solution has been offered by our own Joachim Lange 
[J.LANGE7@genie.com], with his BlueDisk controller card and a 3.5" HD disk 
drive.  This supremely flexible setup not only allows you to read and write 
to high density floppy disks, but will also let you do it using inexpensive 
drives commonly used in the MS-DOS world.  Extensively tested and reported 
upon by our own Harold Hislop [HAROLD.H@genie.com], the BlueDisk setup has 
proved to be just what the doctor ordered for many Apple II users.  If you 
want to find out more, then drop by during any RTC, or read the messages in 
Category 46, Topic 12 (Independent Hardware Companies Online - BlueDisk 
Card -- ///SHH Systeme).

     In a late breaking and related development, still another solution to  
high density disk capability has been offered by our old friend Chua Lin, 
from Tulin Technology.  Some years ago, Tulin began shipping a device 
called a Floptical disk drive, a SCSI device that used 21 MByte 3.5" floppy 
disks.  As a bonus, the unit also functioned as a high density floppy drive 
as well, bringing 1.44 MByte disk capability to the Apple II.  With the 
appropriate file system translators provided in the IIgs system software, 
the Floptical drive allows the IIgs user to utilize both MSDOS and 
Macintosh-format high density disks, in addition to high density disks 
formatted for ProDOS. 

     The upside to the Floptical drive is that it gives this flexibility 
without taking up a precious slot in the computer.  The downside to the 
Floptical drive has always been that they were a bit pricey, however, 
retailing for about $400.  Tulin has rectified this handicap, when in 
August 1995 they posted an offer in the A2 Roundtable, announcing the 
availability of refurbished Floptical disk drives for $129!  For more 
information, you can contact Tulin at 408-432-9057, or email at 
T.TULIN@genie.com.

     Speaking of disk drives, PAUG members have jumped right in with two 
new affordable removable media SCSI disk drives; the Iomega "Zip" drive, an 
SCSI device that uses unique ejectable 100 MByte disks, and a similar 
device from SyQuest, the EZ 135-Drive, with 135 MByte removable disks.  The 
bottom line for both is that they cost in the $200 range, and they both 
work well as Apple II SCSI devices.  The popularity and interest in these 
units was enough that we opened a special topic for each in the A2 
Roundtable; see Category 21 (Add On II Online), Topic 13 - Iomega ZIP 
Drives, and Topic 14 - SyQuest Drives.  In addition, the Zip Drive was 
recently the topic of a Real Time Conference (RTC), and enough valuable 
information was presented that it warranted a special archive of the 
transcript of the RTC.  Just download file #25002 (IOMEGA.ZIP.BXY) for the 
whole story.  And if you're not familiar with A2 Real Time Conference 
sessions, this transcript will give you a good idea of what the RTCs are 
all about!

WHAT'S NEW IN GENIE'S A2 ROUNDTABLE?   In keeping with the theme of
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   this edition of the newsletter, we 
are proud to announce that our favorite Topic Cop, Charles Hartley 
[A2.CHARLIE@genie.com], has completed a top to bottom reorganization of the 
A2 Roundtable's buying and selling arena, Category 4 (The A2 Free Trade 
Zone).  What follows is a breakdown of the topics as they now exist, 
allowing the online Apple II user to quickly and easily find exactly what 
it is they want to buy, or a place to post what they want to sell.

     Charlie's reorganization has worked out well in bringing both sellers 
and buyers together.  Of particular interest to many are topics 36 through 
40, where the A2 Roundtable has taken the initiative in inviting our 
favorite resellers online.  This is where the announcement of Tulin 
Technology's low cost Floptical Drive offer was made, for example.  Another 
new vendor on the scene that has been active in these topics has been Tracy 
Cook of A+ Technologies, whose business is buying used Apple II hardware 
and software by the truckload (literally!), cleaning it up, making sure it 
works, and then offering it for resale to Apple II users worldwide.  He has 
been offering some fantastic bargains on hardware and software, some rare 
items, and many which have not been seen for some time.  Take a look!

IN CONCLUSION   Remember, the goal of the Planetary Apple User Group is to 
"""""""""""""   be _your_ primary Apple II resource!  If you have any 
suggestions, insights, or ways to help us help you...let us know!  Future 
plans include working with groups on the "outside" to create a stronger 
bond within the Apple II community.  Just email C.ADAMS11@genie.com or 
A2.GENA@genie.com, or if you are already online with GEnie (good move!) 
make a post in Category 3, Topic 34 (Planetary Apple Users Group) in the A2 
Roundtable Bulletin Board (m645;1).
