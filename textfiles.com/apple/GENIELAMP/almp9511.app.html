Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     I'm writing this the day after Canada's closest call (so far).  On 
October 30, 1995, the residents of Quebec voted on a sovereignty 
association with Canada (sort of like a limited "trial divorce").  When it 
was rumoured that the separatists were ahead in the poles, financial 
markets all over the world took notice.  I mention this last bit just so 
you don't think we Canadians were suffering from delusions of grandeur.

     Those of you who read my editorial regularly know I make no secret of 
the fact that I'm a Canadian.  Usually I try to make this relevant to the 
Apple II community, as in:  "If you think support for the Apple II from 
Apple Computer was bad for those of you living in the United States, try 
dealing with Apple Canada.  Or Apple Europe.  Or Apple Australia."

     This time, I'm just feeling too shaky.  The results were too 
close--the votes were almost split 50-50, with the federalists, who wanted 
to keep Canada together, getting a lead of just over 1%.  And there's 
reason to believe that we'll be going through the whole thing all over 
again before too much time has passed.

     I feel pretty strongly about the Apple II.  But I also feel strongly 
about my country.  Please forgive me, this month, if the latter has left me 
too shaken to talk about the former.  After all, sometimes it happens the 
other way around.

                                 [*][*][*]


     This month, I'd like to welcome Ray Pasold, who is taking over the 
PAUG Newsletter.  Now, this column has always been popular (see the month's 
mailbox for confirmation), but I think you'll agree that it really rocks 
with Ray in charge.  Welcome to the GEnieLamp A2 team, Ray!

     Also this month, we've had ASCII art submitted by Jason Olson.  I 
always enjoy getting submissions from new contributors... and I suspect 
they enjoy the GEnie credits we pay for submissions, too.  (If you didn't 
know that we pay in non-prime time credit hours, write me for details!)  I 
particularly enjoy the fact that the art Jason has submitted is 
GEnie-specific and Apple II-specific.  Well done, Jason!

THERE'S STILL HOPE   Attention IIgs users.  A small organization has just 
""""""""""""""""""   been born dedicated to promote Apple IIgs products and 
software.  ** M.I.S.F.I.T.S. **

     Our job is to inform IIgs users across the world where they can find 
products and software.  This organization is founded on Apple IIgs.  In 
lieu of the recent events (GS+ Magazine going under, Softdisk loses the 
G-S) I feel that not enough people know where they can find Apple IIgs 
stuff.

     Let me tell you want made me decide to start this organization.  Back 
in January 1994, I scanned Cleveland's local paper for a used computer.  In 
January I found an Apple IIgs and bought it.  Around June, I got another 
IIgs, loaded with extras for just $400.  Since that time I have called 
several leads on IIgs products.  I've called numbers that are no longer in 
service, or have been changed to a different companies.  I became upset 
that no one had IIgs stuff.  Slowly I found companies that still carry 
Apple II products.

     If any one has leads we can follow or direct contact to individuals 
or to large firms that are selling or will sell some software, please write 
me. 

     We are also taking a poll.  We'd like to count the number of IIgs 
owners out there.  Please E-mail us with the name of every IIgs user you 
know.  So that we don't count anyone twice, please give us at least the 
first name and last initial of the person and their address (city and 
state/province).  If all goes well we can force some major companies to 
recognize the IIgs and make software for us.  And if we're really 
successful, Apple will make a IIgs card for the Macintosh.  (Well maybe. 
One never knows.)

     Soon there will be a publication coming out documenting all of the 
hardware and software, and where to get it.  We will be asking for a small 
donation (to cover phone costs, paper, ink, postage, envelops, etc.) for 
the publication. 

     Please help us with this poll. If you know anyone NOT on any on-line 
service pass this onto them, or count them in or something.  We just can't 
stress how much this means to us, since we are an organization designed to 
help YOU!  We are also thinking of producing talented programers.  
Depending on the response we might go through with it.

     Thank you for your help.  APPLE II FOREVER!!

Winona Walsh
W.WALSH3


          Thanks, Winona.  It's always great to hear from those interested 
          in supporting the Apple IIgs.  Perhaps you should get together 
          with PAUG, who are also interested in supporting those who use 
          the Apple II.  And it's a pity you didn't find the A2 RoundTable 
          on GEnie earlier; they could have saved you a lot of frustration.

          You've made an error in claiming that "Softdisk loses the G-S".  
          Softdisk has recently announced the closure of their Softdisk 
          magazine on disk for all Apple II computers.  As we reported in 
          the HEY MISTER POSTMAN column in last month's issue, they intend 
          to continue publishing Softdisk G-S.

          I don't think you can "force" any publishers to produce products 
          for the Apple IIgs.  Encourage them, perhaps, but the best way to 
          do that is to buy products from existing software publishers!  
          Good luck with your resource guide.

          I hope you won't mind my advising you that you should visit the 
          A2 RoundTable, even at this late date.  The people there should 
          be able to help you define and refine your goals.  I think you 
          could use a little help.  Also, people feel more comfortable 
          doing business with people they'd had a chance to get to know a 
          little.

          Most curious of all, you never did explain what M.I.S.F.I.T.S. 
          stands for.  Have I (and by extension, GEnieLamp A2 readers) been 
          the victim of a late April Fool's joke? <grin>


KUDOS   Just like to drop you guys a line to compliment on the fine job on 
"""""   October's GEnieLamp [A2].  Very informative reading.  Downloaded 
the file to run HyperStudio stacks [mentioned in the PAUG Newsletter by 
David Kerwood].  May purchase that program to help my young one get a 
better interest in mathematics.  Keep up the good work.

Gary Ballein
G.BALLEIN

          Thanks, Gary.  The free HyperStudio runtime module is so good 
          that it's hard to believe more people don't know about it.  (Then 
          again, if everyone did know about it, we wouldn't have someone 
          delighted by the discovery every week or so, would we? <grin>)

          I'll make sure David Kerwood sees your remarks.  We do our best 
          to keep you informed; glad to hear we're achieving that goal!

PROTERM AND VT-100 EMULATION   [First section of this post omitted]
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   
     If you went to the computer store and bought an actual Digital 
Equipment Co VT-100 terminal, you would be quick to notice it only has PF1 
- PF4 keys and NOT A SINGLE Function key in sight.  How can that be, when 
the system you call, has ALL those other keys???  The answer is in the 
system designer of the system you're calling.  They are clever and 
individual and there are no standards so they just do what they see fit to 
do the job, and they find ways to "add" functions to keys where they 
normally are not.  Since there is no standard or set way protocols for them 
to follow, they get a bit artistic, and there is no way for us to make a 
"standard" emulation for ProTERM to follow.

     This is not to say you will not be able to use "Function keys," its 
just a matter of getting the "keys" to your system from whomever designed 
it.

     Example:  ProTERM is used by Congress members to get into their 
special computers, and the engineers on that system had been very 
"creative" and developed MANY "function" keys that do not exist in normal 
VT-100.  In that case, there was a need to develop a special emulation 
within ProTERM to handle that special situation (if the traffic is there, 
ProTERM can fit the needs).  In cases where there are just a few users in 
need of certain emulation, macros can ususally do the job.

     Some of the popular options emulation design options we have found:  
Use of the ESCAPE key and then the applicable number key - e.g., ESC-1, 
ESC-2 and so on. Sometimes they even include ESC- - (minus) and ESC - + 
(plus) and other keys which you may have to find out from the system's 
engineer.

     Sometimes they use a run of the alphabet something like:

     ESC-OP  ESC-OQ OR-PS  ESC-OT (UPPER CASE Ohh + P Q R S T U etc.)

     If you do find some hard sets of keystrokes to get what your after, 
this is an excellent place to make use of the System Macro sets.

     > ...connect to the server through the Apple Super Serial yet.

     Make sure the Super Serial Card is set up like the one in the 
Illustration in Appendix C.

     > Is PF1 opt-? or is it opt-! or both?

     Actually both work, but unless you have the (platinum) Apple IIe with 
a keypad, the other keys would be all over the keyboard -- less than 
convenient.

     Some IBM systems recognize ESCAPE 1 through EQUAL on the numbers key 
row and even continue with ESCAPE Q through BACKSLASH on the next row.

     Hope this helps.

     BTW - What is the lil' icon in your SIG?  ;-)

ONE MILLIONTH IIGS?   Someone asked how many machines Apple sold.
"""""""""""""""""""
     According to a briefing by Tim Swihart at KansasFest a few years ago, 
Apple sold about 1 million Apple IIGS computers.  About 2/3 of those went 
to schools, where they were predominantly used as fast Apple //es.

     I don't remember the number he mentioned for 8 bit Apples for sure, 
but I think it was around 3 million.  I've never seen that broken down by 
machine type or how many went to schools.

     That can be a probem.  Advertising on GEnie or Internet is a good 
start.  Another:  Ask me.  Send me your address, and I'll tell you how many 
people we have in our database with the same zip code.  If you live in an 
area with multiple zip codes, send me the list.  If you want to mail to 
these people, send me a bundle of stamped mailers, ready for an address 
label, and I'll mail them for you.

     It would, of course, be simpler if I just sent you the list, but 
there are too many potential ways that could be abused.  Offering to mail 
your letters of introduction for you is the next best way.  And if you send 
prestamped mailers, I won't charge you for it.  I'm only doing this to help 
you get a group started, if you're so inclined.

HELPING WITH THE QUICK CLICK CALC REVISION   I'm working on a feature 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   request for QC Calc and ran 
across an interesting design issue.  I'm hoping some of you with a European 
background can help.

     QC Calc allows displaying of numbers in the (more sensible, I think) 
contenental form, where the comma is used where Americans use a decimal 
place, and vice-versa.  So, instead of writing 1,234.56, you would write 
1.234,56.  (That makes some sense; I don't know how many math problems have 
been incorrectly solved because a tiny period was missed, when a comma 
would have been seen.  Anyway...)

     QC Calc _doesn't_ currently allow numbers to be _entered_ this way, 
which is, as you can immagine, rather frusterating for anyone used to this 
system.

     I'd like to allow entry of numbers using comma-decimal places, but 
there is a symantic conflict with the commas used in functions.  For 
example, using period-decimal places, it's clear that

        Min(1.2)          = 1.2
        Min(1,2)          = 1

     Unfortunately, with commas as decimal points, this distinction is 
lost.  This particular case is a little contrived, but the whole issue pops 
up again and again in real equations.  Using spaces doesn't help, either. 
It _can_ solve issues, but requires very precise typing, and it is very 
easy to make a mistake.

     It seems to me there ought to be some solution to this problem 
already in use, and commonly accepted, among folks who use commas for 
decimal points.  The question is:  what is the prefered solution?

     BTW, on my own, the best I could come up with is using ; instead of 
commas as function argument separators.  That would work, but why invent 
some crazy new scheme if there is already an accepted solution?  ;)

     I'd appreciate any help you folks might be able to offer.

HOW GS/OS IS BETTER THAN MAC OS   1.  ProDos will allow you to reformat a 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   defective disk.  HFS will eject it with 
an error message.  You need to load up a utility program BEFORE inserting 
the bad disk in order to fix it so that you can reformat it, and sometimes 
it can't be fixed, period.  I have (many times) taken an 800K disk that the 
Mac won't touch, reformatted it on the GS, an then was able to reformat it 
on the Mac without problems.

     2.  If you try to copy a batch of files from one directory to 
another, and there is a duplicate file, the GS Finder will allow you to 
skip that file and continue copying the rest of them without even a burp.  
The Mac Finder will only allow you to overwrite the file or cancel the 
entire operation.

     3.  GSOS allows you to drop sounds in a SOUNDS folder, the Mac forces 
you install sound files in the System file, and the size of the system file 
has a direct effect on the ammount of system resources the Mac uses, and 
how fast things run.

     4.  GSOS has both an "erase" and a "format" command for disks.  The 
Mac has only an "erase" command, which actually does a full format.

     Of course, I can list MORE items where the Mac OS is superior to 
GSOS, but I'm a chauvinist. :)

     5.  GS/OS won't open up every single font in your system when you 
boot like the Mac does.

     6.  GS/OS allows virtually unlimited amount of files to be open at 
once, while the Mac has a preset limit that either wastes memory or 
cripples your system until the limit is set higher (+ a reboot). (See #5)

     7.  GS/OS supports File System Translators (FSTs) as a fundamental 
part of its operation, while the Mac OS has to be kludgily patched by 
extensions to duplicate the same behavior.

     8.  GS/OS handles file resources faster than the Mac OS.

     In short, GS/OS is still rather impressive.

     9.  GS/OS supports multiple forms of access for programmers (inline, 
and stack based call vectors)

     A.  GS/OS loads all it's partitionable media device drivers from 
files, or uses self generated driver code to access a rom based driver, 
instead of using dedicated partitions on partitionable media as does the 
Mac OS.  This simplifies updating drivers for block devices and makes 
version checking very easy.

     And to probably knock one off Michaels additions (sorry...)

> 8.  GS/OS handles file resources faster than the Mac OS.

     Technically the IIgs resource manager (which is the only thing that's 
ever supposed to touch a resource fork, outside of a file copier) isn't 
part of GS/OS, it's a toolset.

     I don't spit any Mac code, but under GS/OS when you open a file one 
of the paramaters specifies which fork (data, resource) of the file is 
supposed to be opened.  I suspect it's much the same on the Mac.

     And to make up for knocking an item off the list, one to replace it :)

     x.  The native (boot) file system used with GS/OS (ProDOS) has a much 
more sanely designed directory structure than the Mac's native (HFS) file 
system.  This leads to faster file access and fewer occurances of damaged 
directories.

     They didn't ask for my comments this time, but I'll make 'em anyway :)

     1) This thing reeks of John Sculley, doesn't it?  Telling us they'll 
support the Apple II, then trying to sell us something else. . . 

     2) Isn't it their legal responsibility to support us until the 
computer's been out of production for seven years?

     3) The suggestion that an Apple II user go to an Apple Computer, Inc. 
dealer for support is something like telling someone who eats a Golden 
Delicious that's worm infested to go to an Apple Computer, Inc. for medical 
care.  The proper referral is to either (a) GEnie or (b) a local user 
group.

     4) I called 1-800-SOS-APPL last week, for help with my Powerbook

(Intelligent.Battery.hqx) and where to find it kinda ("on the Internet" :), 
but was stopped in her tracks by the question, "What's the URL?"

     and finally,

     5) How come Apple sent this letter to my dad instead of me? :)

STAYING IN TOUCH WITH REALITY   I have been a GS owner since 1987.  I 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   consider myself a Power User for quite some 
time now.  Each year, I spend a significant amount of money on my GS.  At 
times, I spend more than I should.  But I really like the IIgs.  So far, it 
has done everything I need it to do.

     However, it is a no-brainer to see what is happening to this great 
machine and the people who, like me, use it everyday.  The GS appears to be 
coming to an end faster than I would like it to.  And yes, I know that it 
has been on borrowed time ever since Apple dropped it from their 
production.  I can't believe I'm about to say this but Apple is not solely 
to blame for the demise of the GS.

     Look at it in the way of cars.  An auto company puts out a car.  
Then, a few years later decides to discontinue it.  Does this mean the car 
is rendered useless?  No.  You can still have the car worked on at a 
service center.  You can still buy parts for it.  There are people and 
companies that still supply those parts and accessories for it.

     I think the GS could have fallen in the same category as the above 
example.  But vendors and makers of peripherals chose not to support it. 
Yes there are many reasons for their decisions, mainly money and survival. 
But I believe, with better effort, those people who got out could have 
stayed and endured.

     I really believe that the demise of the GS began not when Apple 
dropped it, but when A+/Incider added Macintosh columns in their magazine. 
It really went down hill, when it became a subscription-only magazine.  
That is when they decided not to sell it on newsstands and in book stores.  
I think this move really left people in the dark.

     Why?  Because those people who picked it up from time to time at a 
stand or store suddenly became forgotten.  Also, they became unaware of any 
new products that came out afterwards.  Instead, the places these people 
went to buy A+/Incider were being overwhelmed with Mac and PC mags.  Their 
GS' at home were slowly beginning to sit there becoming idle. They were 
possibly influenced into purchasing a Mac and PC because, they believed, 
nothing else was out there for the GS.  They may have thought that 
companies like Sequential Systems and Seven Hills Software were not around 
because there was no magazine in a store to tell about them.

     Now I'm not saying that this is the case for everyone who has ever 
owned a GS and then bought a PC or Mac.  But I have a gut feeling this 
happened to A LOT of people.  In fact, I picked up my second GS this past 
summer. The guy I bought it from switched to a Mac Se and then to a Power 
Mac.  Anyway, the GS came with quite a bit of software.  But would you 
believe that besides the system software, there was not one piece of GS 
specific software?!  It was all Apple IIe stuff.  The GS itself had no 
memory expansion, just the basic 256k that came with the ROM 01.

     Over the last two years, I have heard at user group meetings and read 
online like AOL (when it supported the Apple II) and Genie the old and 
famous Apple II quote "support those that will support you".  Since October 
of last year, I have made the following purchases:  Spectrum 2.0 upgrade, 
Quickie Hand Scanner, Disc Quest and DQ Encyclopedia, the Second Sight, the 
Blue Disk, an upgrade to my RamFast, Lost Treasures of Infocom, 
DreamGrafix, renewed my GS+ subscription, subscribe to Genie and subscribed 
to SoftDisk GS.  I have made other purchases like my 14" inch SVGA, 3.5" 
high density drive, Apple CDSC CDROM, and an Apple extended keyboard but 
this money was not circulated back in the Apple II world like the first 
list.

     So you can see, I have spent quite a bit of money in the past year.  
But what gets me is that some of the developers of the products I purchased 
in the first list, have not informed me of any type of upgrade or any info 
about new products.  Now remember I said SOME, not all and I think these 
people should know who they are.  I am very grateful that these people 
still make quality products for my machine.  I am also thankful that they 
still support their products and the GS.  But how about letting me/us know 
about upgrades or new products via email?  I believe that this has to be 
the cheapest method of all for those of us with an email address.

     It just seems that as a registered owner, sometimes I still feel 
abandoned.  I am charged if I just want a peripheral looked at or I'm 
getting an upgrade that is a minor bug fix.  Yes I know you have mouths to 
feed.  But my point is to make me overlook that.  I mean keep me aware of 
what's going on and maybe I won't mind paying $30 or $35 to see if 
something is wrong with a board or paying $20-$25 to go from version 2.0 to 
2.01 of a product.

     Many times I find out about a product from a second or third source.  
For example, many times I'll read of an upgrade of a product I own or a new 
product from a programmer that I'm already a registered owner with, from 
GenieLamp.  While I am thankful that I get to learn of it from somewhere, I 
think I would feel better if I heard or read it straight from the company 
via email.  One reason could be that there are people on Genie who have no 
idea what GenieLamp is or how to get it.

     This isn't about just my feelings.  I believe that this is about 
survival, for companies that support the GS, and GS owners who support the 
companies.  Maybe you could ask for an email address on the registration 
card.  One factor in a company's reasoning for not having done this before, 
is time.  I don't know how time consuming it is for someone to send carbon 
copies of email to registered owners.  But if in fact it is, maybe someone 
could volunteer to help out with sending news and info online.  I would be 
glad to help anyone out in that matter.

     I believe that it was a lack of communication on both ends that has 
the GS on the end of its rope.  On the part of the owner, he/she could have 
let developers know that they will stick with the GS.  On the developers' 
side, they could have asked what people wanted to see made or what will 
people support.

     This brings me to one last item.  Developers need to get rid of the 
idea of advertising an unfinished product.  This has happened so many times 
in the past year and a half and it is putting a sense of distrust in the GS 
market.  There was the Turbo Rez, Wolfenstein 3D, Faxination, and  Second 
View.

     Developers need to faith in those who remain loyal to the GS.  By 
waiting to advertise a product that is currently being tested rather than 
being written, the buyer can be sure of a high quality full functionable 
product.

     In closing, I hope the GS can thrive for a little longer. I want to 
see a new word processor and a GS specific grammar checker.  It seems that 
the GS is the only computer platform without one.  I hope that PMP gets 
that fax software soon.  Products like these will strengthen the GS' 
longevity.  I'd hate to have to buy a Mac and start all over.

>>>>>   Sorry, guy, but you're ignoring reality
"""""
     First the simple points.  E-mail isn't a particularly effective way 
to advertise, although many people (including me) try it from time to time. 
That's why you've never heard from those companies.  Posting information is 
about as effective, and takes a lot less time.  Maintaining customer 
support areas, and posting there is even better.  (I know.  I do it.)  The 
most effective method is still bulk mail.  One of the main reasons is that 
a screen shot is worth a thousand words, to mutilate a phrase.  :)

     Second, blaming those of us who have stayed around is silly.  Blaming 
those who left is silly, too.  The problem is a simple one of numbers.  
Quite frankly, I looked seriously at doing a word processor for the GS. 
Sales of our other new programs convinced me I would be nuts to do one.  
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to put 6 months of work into a product only to 
be told by the 100 people who buy it, "Gee, I wanted Microsoft Word on a 
GS, but without all the problems it had on the Mac.  You could have _at 
least_ read Microsoft word files, Word Perfect files, AppleWorks GS files, 
MacWrite files, ..."

     I made a promise long ago that I would not abandon the GS, but that I 
would wait until the GS abandoned me.  Sounds nice.  What it meant in real 
terms is that I would wait until I started consistently loosing money on 
programs before I would quit developing for the GS.

     It's happened.

     So, if you want a word processor, or a grammer checker, or whatever, 
it's really up to you, not me.  I'm already spending all of my available 
time and money to tell people about the Apple IIGS in general, and my 
products in particular.  I'm already spending all the time I can afford 
(more, really) developing for the GS.  If you want to see me developing 
more software, you'll have to help provide an environment where the 
software can sell.

     You probably can't do that.  But here's some practical things all of  
you can do:

     1.  Find out who in your area owns an Apple IIGS, and start a small 
user's group.  A social group works better than any other kind.  Make it a 
social gathering at someone's house, not a big meeting in a rented room.  
Meet to have fun, and talk about computers as one way to have fun.

     2.  Make sure when you get a mailer that everyone you know who has a 
GS sees it.  I know we don't mail to everyone on our mailing list anymore.  
There's no percentage in it.  So pass those mailings around; even if 
someone has a companies products, they may no longer be on the active 
mailing list.

     3.  Once a year, whether you want to buy anything right then or not, 
get in touch with every Apple II company you do business with and make sure 
you are current.  We've rented mailing lists from other companies, and 
mailed to our own, but it's been a _long_ time since we mailed to someone 
who had not contacted the company on more than a year.  There's just no 
percentage in it.  As a result, many people who have our programs don't 
know about recent upgrades and products.  If they would take the time to 
tell us they are alive and still use their Apple IIGS, we would still mail 
to them.  But do some simple math:  Are we likely to send 70 cent mailings 
to a list of people who may have moved (20% per year), may not have an 
Apple IIGS, or may have died (litterally)?  Typical responses on mailings 
are 1-3%.  Do dome math, and you'll undertand.

     I am not blaming you, or anyone else, for the problems with the GS. 
OK, I lied.  I blame Apple's top brass.  But no one else.  Still, the Apple 
II companies who are still here are not to blame either.  They are doing 
their best.  If you're serious about helping, the things on this list are 
your best ways of doing it.

WARP SIX VERSION 3.0
""""""""""""""""""""
 o   Moved the assignment of variables XA and FF to LOGON from XFER.UTIL to 
     make updates a bit more painless in the future.

 o   Added some memory management to the entire BBS. It now saves a base 
     set of variables needed to operate while a user is online and if a 
     portion of the BBS creates a bunch of new variables (many games...) or 
     fills up arays (mail and forums) the BBS can now clear those from 
     memory before moving on.

 o   Users can now logon by name as well as ID#.

 o   There is now an optional guest account with a 20 minute time limit. 
     The sysop can select an unused account to be set up with security zero 
     and set the system for read only in selected forums so new users can 
     peek around before applying for an account. This cuts down on 
     validating those "one time users" looking for files or whatever...

 o   Added some intelligence to the logon procedure. It will now prompt 
     users in some cases, such as if they select the wrong ID# by mistake. 
     After trying their password 2 times, it will ask if they are "user x" 
     and if not they can re-enter their password. If their account was 
     purged for inactivity, it will notify them of the possibility and ask 
     if they wish to apply for a new account. If yes they will be sent 
     directly to ADD.USER.

 o   Added ANSI auto-detect at logon. You must still supply ANSI screens 
     and necessary basic lines for any screens you want to add yourself 
     just like with PSE. ANSI uses the PS flag. 0=no emulation, 128=ANSI, 
     255=PSE.

 o   Added a slightly longer pause before answering a call and before the 
     BBS receives control back from the modem driver. This is to fix some 
     problems "some" modems have when attempting to auto-detect PSE and 
     ANSI. It also gives any Caller ID device you have on the BBS line time 
     to receive the CID info between the first and second ring.

 o   Added a co-sysop security level (SL-8). SL-8 can now see locked files, 
     has access to sysop utilities, and each user with SL-8 has an 
     individual remote password separate from the sysop's.

 o   "Report to sysop" now supports a mutiple name list to include your 
     co-sysops.

 o   Added "sysop doing user maintenance" feature. When a user is online 
     and at the MAIN menu prompt, pressing OPTION while pressing return at 
     the local keyboard will send the sysop to the sysop utilities. While 
     there, the sysop has access to any functions in the menu plus a 
     couple. Pressing "+" or "-" with this feature will increment or 
     decrement the online user's security level by one (each time it is 
     pressed). The user is given a polite message and asked to wait. they 
     do NOT see the sysop working. The user is notified when the sysop 
     returns (quits from Sysop utilities). Real nice for instant validation 
     when you have a caller ID box on the BBS line.

 o   Added a "Locate user" function to sysop utilities. You can search on a 
     user's alias, real name (last or last and first), or partial last name 
     (contains "xxx"). Returns name, alias, and ID# for any matches.

 o   The sysop can copy a user to a new ID#. If you need this, use it with 
     caution for obvious reasons...

 o   Purge will now ignore users with security level above a selected 
     number (default=2). The sysop selects the level they wish EACH time 
     purge is used. This allows users to have permanent accounts if you 
     wish. Much less manual purging necessary.

 o   Added a file copy command to SYSOP.UTIL. It was in version 2.5 but you 
     had to chain to it using the ProDOS command. Now just select from the 
     menu. It supports BATCH copy, move, delete, lock, and unlock. Files 
     are selected by number. 20 file maximum to each batch.

 o   Moves the menu comand for SORT user list to sysop utilities where it 
     really belonged anyway. Rewrote the sort routine for more speed. It 
     now uses a SHELL sort instead of the old reliable (but S-L-O-W) BUBBLE 
     sort. User lists will be sorted alphabetically  by name or alias based 
     on the alias flag for your BBS. Real names are formatted to 2 columns. 
     Aliases are formatted to 4 columns.

 o   Added a forum queue feature. Users can select which forums they wish 
     to attend when using Quickscan or Continuous Quickscan. Users can 
     still manually enter any forum they wish regardless of their queue 
     selections. This feature works with 20 forums. If you have more forums 
     than this the BBS won't crash but the user's queues will be ignored. 
     You will be prompted when you atempt to add forum number 21.

 o   There is now an alias flag for EACH individual forum. If you run a 
     real name system, you can now include a forum that supports aliases 
     for the users to get a bit crazy in. Likewise if you have an alias 
     system, you can have a real name forum for serious discussion.

 o   User selectable screen clear (or not) between each message in the 
     forums.

 o   Fixed a bug in the forums. If a user tried to MAIL a reply from the 
     same message twice, the BBS would log them off with an error #5.

 o   Users can now send mail to another user's ID#. Much faster than 
     sending to a username.

 o   Users can now send multiple carbon copies in Email. Send carbons to 
     user names, aliases, or ID#s.

 o   Added a door game prefix to SYS.DATA and an optional door launcher 
     program will be included.

 o   Changed VALIDATION date to FIRST date on the system. This field is no 
     longer updated when a user is validated. This allows a "flag" of sorts 
     to see if a user account has been purged and taken over by a new user. 
     This was needed to reset some of the new features in version 3.0 for a 
     new user. Also good for game scores.

 o   Added some info to the caller status block at the top of the sysop's 
     screen when a user is online.

 o   Modified the "waiting for call" screen. Now shows sysop mail waiting 
     and how much new. I got tired of logging on just to check my mail... 
     <Grin>

     I was working on a feature to attach files to mail but ran into some 
problems. It will not be included in version 3.0 but MAY be in a future 
release.

     Frank Kucharski is working on the file transfer stuff and has had a 
very hectic schedule lately. It doesn't look like his changes will be done 
in time for version 3.0 but we will release a new version when he is done.

     Jim Ferr is working on the drivers and all Asembly portions of Warp 
Six. He has made quite a few changes but not a lot of it is real evident to 
the users... The biggest thing you will see is the file list in the 
transfer section. It is now displayed in 2 columns.

     Hopefully we will have this released by Christmas. I need to finish 
debugging, write an updater program, update the help files, and rewrite the 
documentation. Basically all the fun stuff...  :(

DEJA II (APPLEWORKS 5 FOR THE MAC)   IT'S SHIPPING!
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     The commercial version of Deja II is now shipping.  I spent this past 
weekend out of town and away from my trusty Apple IIgs, but I was still 
able to use AppleWorks 5.1... on my PowerBook 165 with Deja II.  It's fast 
and smooth.  At last, AppleWorks runs on a NOTEBOOK system.

     With the MAC system 7.5, AppleWorks is completely seamless.  Read and 
write AppleWorks files directly to/from Apple ProDOS disks in the MAC 
superdrive, or rewrite directly to a MAC HFS volume.  It's all the same to 
Deja II.

     I never thought I'd see the day.  THREE CHEERS FOR RANDY BRANDT!!

FUTUREVISION 4.1 STATUS UPDATE   FutureVision 4.1 is VERY close to being 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   finalized and released in less than 20 
pieces :)  I know this has been said before, but being pretty close to the 
source, I can tell you it's for real this time. :)  If for no other reason 
than the current "author/supporter" is having time constraint problems (the 
reason it's taken so long) and wants to have a final version out before he 
transfers the "authorship" to someone else.  This will most likely happen 
within a month.  (I'm hoping sooner, personally, but knowing the way this 
has been going, I'm not going to hold him to the "later this week" that he 
told me ;)

     The only major problems at this point are with the internet gateway 
software, and since there's only 3 sites using it at the moment, it 
probably won't be a big deal if it gets released with those minor bugs 
left.  (It's fully functional, it's mostly cosmetic changes related to the 
way email and news articles look when received on outside systems on the 
internet)

     One way or another, I can tell you that I will be personally 
uploading the full suite of METAL/FutureVision stuff here to A2 within the 
next three weeks, whether it's "finalized" or not. :)  This has gone on way 
too long. :)

     Just for yucks, the current version of METAL is v1.09.07, and the 
current version of FV if v4.1b5(d).  The d means there have been 4 
"package" updates to the b5 core (small archives with 2 or 3 replacement 
files).

     The Internet's become trendy, and more people than ever before are 
mucking about on it.  With easier access has come a flood of people and 
posters with little concept of discretion.  Many of these aspiring net 
personalities seem compelled to fill everyone's screens with elaborate .sig 
files that often border on the baroque.  It's always a delight when reading 
news to encounter postings that consist of 100 lines reposted verbatim, the 
profound addition "I agree!", and a closing .sig file that sometimes comes 
close to filling the screen with dippy pictures and a compendium of their 
personal witticisms.  I've noticed some common attributes to these bloated 
.sigs:

     1) Cute pictures.  Little bicycle people, roses, Amiga arrows, tire 
tracks, twinkle stars, etc.  Rest assured, they're all just as cute the 
27th time you post them.

     2) Cursive letters.  These seem to be all the rage.  It gives your 
post all the more authority if you sign it:

 _ _ _
' ) ) )               /       /
 / / / _  _,  __.  __/ . . __/ _
/ ' (_</_(_)_(_/|_(_/_(_/_(_/_</_
          /|
         |/

Extreme coolness of this magnitude proclaims, "Hey, I may only be a 12 year 
old using my Dad's America Online account, but I can ASCII upload all by 
myself!"

     3) Dippy quotes.  Impress the world with your wit and wisdom 
distilled into 4 or 5 lines (or puffed up to 9 or 10, as the case may be).  
Make these particularly profound and/or hip, so they'll still be delightful 
after 3 or 4 months of posting.  Trivial quotes of heavy metal lyrics, 
Doors/Floyd/Zeppelin songs, and Star Trek and Monty Python episodes are all 
a must.

     4) 3-D stuff.  Neato!  Nifty!  Keen!  Show your "depth" with boxes, 
shadow letters, cubes, etc.

     5) Nicknames.  Build your net persona with a catchy handle, maybe 
something like "eni?gma", "Wondrous1", "SoHot4U", or "smOOthie".  Make your 
readers wince with vicarious embarrassment.

     Well, I've combined as many of these features as I could and have 
come up with candidate for Most Annoying .Sig File.  Just edit in your name 
and login, post, and wait for the delighted responses to fill your mailbox.

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

                   >>> THE CASE OF THE WEBBED TENANT <<<
                   """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Online communication will surely be changing the way we work and live 
in the years ahead.  These changes will affect many of our social and 
business relationships.

     This past week I've been thinking about how online communication 
might affect the landlord/tenant relationship.  On its face, this 
relationship would appear to be immune to the new online world. On closer 
examination, the possibilities (and probabilities) of online communication 
between landlord and tenant begin to emerge.

     Suppose, for example, that you're the manager of a large apartment 
building.  Within the building are 80 apartment units.

     Given the mobile society we live in, chances are that this apartment 
building has a turnover of 3 to 4 tenants each month.  Your job, as manager 
of the building, is to interview new tenants for the apartments that become 
vacant each month.

     Apartment managers have one primary responsibility, namely, to screen 
out apartment applicants who appear to lack responsibility from those 
apartment applicants who appear possess responsibility.  It's a tough call 
to make when you only get 15-20 minutes to visit with the people who have 
expressed an interest in the apartments.

     Now suppose that you have a list of 12 persons who are interested in 
a certain apartment.  And further suppose that 3 out of those 12 persons 
casually mention that they have set up a personal web page for themselves. 

     What you, as a decision maker, have is an opportunity to gather 
further information without having to call the apartment applicants back 
for a second interview.  In essence, the people who have set up personal 
web pages are giving you the opportunity of learning more about them, 
without having to go through a process of interviewing them at length.

     Given the above scenario, who do you think has the better chance of 
being offered an apartment?  The folks who already have a home page have a 
greater chance of having a physical home to go with it.

     Admittedly, some people might say that it is possible to put whatever 
information you want on your home page.  You could represent yourself in a 
way that totally masks who you are as a person.

     True, such mischief could happen.  But at some point it becomes 
self-defeating to have a home page that masks your true self.  After all, 
you could be sending out misinformation to people who you have an interest 
in knowing about the real you.

     Relationships are two way things, so how would online communication 
benefit tenants?  Well, as an apartment seeker, would it not be convenient 
to be able to jot off an E-mail message to several current tenants of a 
building to hear about their view of the building's management?  You might 
feel shy about calling such people out of the blue, but you wouldn't feel 
as shy about sending them a short E-mail inquiry asking about how they feel 
about the building's management.

     If the building manager has access to your own web page, then it 
wouldn't be unnatural to ask the manager to give you the E-mail addresses 
of a few of the current tenants.

     The result of all this is that everyone is able to access more 
information about each other, enabling everyone to make more informed 
decisions.  Some might see this as yet one more in-road to personal 
privacy.  But from where I sit, I see this as a positive development.

     If I were to apply for an apartment, I would have no qualms about 
giving the apartment manager the URL of my personal web page.  The web page 
gives detailed info about my interests and work.  By definition, I'm not 
going to put something on my web page that I would not want the general 
public to know.

     If my web page can help the apartment manager make a more informed 
decision about my application, so much the better for both of us.  I take 
pride in being an upstanding, contributing member of the community.  If 
technology can help differentiate me from the less-reliable-tenant, so much 
the better.

     Each of us hungers for information that can make our life's decisions 
more informed and less risky.  Online communication helps further this goal 
in almost every type of social and business relationship.

     You may be surprised at how relationships will be changing in the 
coming years.  One thing is for sure:  Those who take time to consider the 
impending changes will be able to plan accordingly.

                  >>> INFORMATION HIGHWAY TRAVEL KIT <<<
                  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     When you visit Usenet newsgroups and the World Wide Web, you come 
across mysteries so deep that you're not sure that one is meant to solve 
them.  For example, on the newsgroup comp.binaries.apple2, you might see a 
message that begins:

FiLeStArTfIlEsTaRt
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789()
GBINSCII        AQhmAAAAA8)4MIAI02DA9ARMQEDtAQhmAIVZ
gYITA6u7xADA0MjM3YTNBlDOENkQwYURzITM2UDN5gzNDJUQGVERyEDM1QzM4cjN
CFUOFR0QxAjR0MjM3YTNBlDOENkQwAQRzITM2UDN5gzNDJUQGVERyEDM1QzM4cjN

     Or perhaps the message begins this way:

begin 666 goodluck.bxy
M4W5N3U,@4F5L96%S92 T+C$@*%-$4U0V,"D@(S@Z(%1U92!/8W0@.2 Q,CHS
M...3HT.2!%1%0@,3DY, HT

     Your first reaction might be to back away and find something more 
interesting, which isn't a bad idea.  After a while, you'll realize that 
these messages are encoded files that you can use.  Then you'll want to 
know how to decode them.

     Decoding is always easy if you have a code book.  And there are code 
books for the Apple II, even though most of the people who wrote the codes 
didn't have the Apple II in mind.  We've been fortunate enough to have 
freelance programmers provide the code books for themselves and for their 
fellows.

     You need decoders for three basic things:  pictures, sounds, and 
programs.  You're likely to run into pictures and sounds on web pages.  
Since you're limited to browsing the web with Lynx, which is text based, 
you can't see the pictures or hear the sounds as you browse.  What you can 
do is download them for later retrieval.

PICTURES   The two most popular still picture formats on the web are GIF 
""""""""   and JPEG.  There are plenty of programs for viewing GIF files on 
a IIgs and even one or two programs for viewing them on the IIe and IIc.  
In fact, there are too many GIF programs to discuss in a column like this.  
I'll just mention a couple I use regularly:

                File #23435:  SHOWME1.1.1.BXY (73984 bytes)
                '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     ShowMe by Dave Leffler is popular with IIgs users who want graphics 
viewers in a New Desk Accessory.  This makes a good quick-and-dirty viewer.  
It can also show many other picture formats, including PaintWorks 
animations, and has a "slide show" mode.

                File #23970:  IMAGEQUANT.BXY (38912 bytes)
                ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     If you want more options for viewing GIF files on your IIgs, you 
should try ImageQuant v0.3 by Tim Meekins.  Like ShowMe, ImageQuant handles 
a lot more than just GIF files, but it allows various manipulations of GIF 
images.

                                 [*][*][*]


     At least as popular as GIF are JPEG graphics.  Some compromises have 
to be made when viewing JPEG graphics, since they were designed for 
computers that have much greater resolution than even the IIgs.  (This 
sometimes happens with GIF graphics, too, but the effect is less dramatic.)

     Here, your options are more limited... and I'm afraid there's no JPEG 
viewer or converter for the Apple IIe or IIc.  If you use a IIgs, you can 
choose between a JPEG viewer and a JPEG converter:

                    File #22640:  JV.BXY (14976 bytes)
                    ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     JPEG Viewer by Ushiroda, Atsushi is a pre-release--that is, 
unfinished--program that allows you to view JPEG graphics in monochrome.  
Once you seen a thumbnail sketch of the graphic, you get to scroll the 
picture through a viewing window.  This allows you to see any part of the 
picture in detail.  There's no way to see all the picture at once except 
for that brief glimpse of the thumbnail sketch.

                 File #25931:  JPEG.V6.BXY  (414336 bytes)
                 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This utility is a JPEG converter for the IIgs.  It allows you to 
convert JPEG graphics to other formats.  For your purposes, its great value 
is that it converts from JPEG to GIF, which is well supported for the IIgs 
platform.  This converter allows color conversions, and will also let you 
scale down the graphics--by a half, a quarter, or an eighth--so that you 
can view all of it at once on the IIgs screen.  This program has a 
command-line interface and requires a shell (ORCA or GNO), which means it 
isn't for absolute beginners.

                                 [*][*][*]


     As you can see, you can view GIF and JPEG graphics once you've 
downloaed them.  Some web pages have animations attached to them as well, 
but Apple II users can't do much with the most popular kinds.  This may 
change now that the SecondSight video card is on the market.  One animation 
viewer for .DL format animations has just been updated to work with the 
SecondSight (File #25749:  VIEWDL20.BXY [18420 bytes]).  This is not a 
popular format for web pages, but it tells of things still to come!

SOUNDS   Some people attach sounds to their web pages.  These are usually 
""""""   in .WAV or .AU format, and now IIgs users can finally hear them, 
thanks to programmer Paul Creager.

                File #25825:  RSOUNDER3.BXY (342248 bytes)
                ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Creager's rSounder program has long been popular for converting sound 
files to system sounds, but v3.0 of this great program now allows you to 
hear .WAV and .AU sounds, as well as create them.

                                 [*][*][*]


PROGRAMS   You'll often be transferring programs from file areas rather 
""""""""   than "reading" files on newsgroups.  Transferring files is 
pretty painless once you get the hang of it, but when it comes time to 
unpack the files, you may find that they've been packed with something 
other than ShrinkIt.

     The most popular universal file-archiving format seems to ZIP (more 
properly PKZIP).  Apple II users have had access to these sorts of files 
for some time now.  Apple IIe and IIc users should use Angel v0.81 by Tony 
Marques:

     File #20501:  ANGEL.BXY  (29568 bytes)

...while IIgs users may prefer to use PMPunZip by Paul Parkhurst:

     File #21048:  PMPUNZIP2.0.BXY (112896 bytes)

     Another format that seems to be present on many Internet sites is 
gzip, an archiving method popular among Unix-based computers.  Files packed 
with gzip usually end with the extension .gz.  One some sites, you can have 
gzip files unpack automatically just by entering a "+" as the first 
character of your password when you log in to the site.  If that doesn't 
work, you can try:

                   File #25755:  GZ2PKZ.BXY (7680 bytes)
                   '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This utility converts gzip files for .ZIP format.  It too has a 
command-line interface and requires a shell like ORCA or GNO.  Once the 
file has been converted to .ZIP, you can use Angel or PMPunZip to unpack 
it.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Sometimes, there's another step involved in sharing files.  After 
using a program such as ShrinkIt or PKZIP to archive and compress a file or 
collection of files, you may need to convert it to a format that allows it 
to be posted on a newsgroup.

     In order to be posted on a newsgroup, a file must contain only 
printable ASCII characters such the alphabet, numerals, and punctuation 
marks.  Two methods of converting a file to printable ASCII are BinSCII and 
uuencode.  (There are also BinHex and NuFX, but you're less likely to run 
into them.)  Remember the gobbledegook at the start of this column?  A 
message that begins with "FiLeStArTfIlEsTaRt" is probably BinSCII, and a 
posting that starts with "begin 666 filename.ext" is probably uuencoded.

     If you have an Apple IIe or IIc computer, you should download:

                 File #19282:  BINSCII.UU.BXY (7424 bytes)
                 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This contains UUencode v1.1 by Andy Tefft and BinSCII v1.0.3 by David 
Whitney.  With these two utilities, you should be able to decode the 
strange messages you find on "binaries" newsgroups.

               File #23636:  GSCII.2.3.1.BXY  (64128 bytes)
               ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This one is for IIgs users.  This NDA not only handles BinSCII and 
uuencode but also BinHex.

                                 [*][*][*]


     There's one final utility I want to look at, even though it doesn't 
have anything to do with processing the pictures, sound, or programs you 
find on the Internet.  This utility lets you create things to put on the 
Internet.

     Once you've seen a few web pages, you'll notice that they share 
certain characteristics.  That's because they're documents written with a 
mark-up language called HTML.  Now there's a HyperCard stack to let you 
create your own HTML documents.

                 File #25816:  HTMLEDIT.BXY (82688 bytes)
                 ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This HTML editor, from The Nova Scotia Apple Users Group (I thought 
I'd mention that since I used to be a long-distance member), requires 
HyperCard IIgs.  It helps you create documents and helps you find errors 
but doesn't actually let you view or test the documents.

     There's no reason some intrepid soul couldn't write a similar utility 
that ran perfectly well under UltraMacros for AppleWorks.  There's nothing 
very IIgs-specific about this program, unless it's the pull-down menus.  
It's a good utility, though!  (If it let you view what you'd created, it 
would be _GREAT_!)

                                 [*][*][*]


     I haven't by any means touched on all the Internet-related files in 
the A2 RoundTable Libraries, but I think I've listed most of the ones that 
are absolutely vital.  I was most encouraged to see that Internet tools 
such as rSounder v3.0 and HTML Editor were uploaded since last month.  It 
makes me feel that the Apple II community is keeping up with the Internet!

WHAT IS PAUG?   The mission of the Planetary Apple User Group (PAUG) is to 
"""""""""""""   serve as the online heart of the worldwide Apple II 
community.  PAUG's goals include providing help and support for anyone who 
may not have a local user group nearby, and for user groups that want a 
virtual link to the Heart of the Apple II world.  Creating a link between 
PAUG and both the online and offline user group community is one of our 
priorities.  PAUG sponsorship of an online user group is focused on 
promoting the fact that the Apple II is not only still alive, but doing 
very well.


WHAT DOES PAUG DO?   There _is_ support!  PAUG will provide it, or help you 
""""""""""""""""""   find it.  We meet the third Sunday of every month at 
7:00 p.m. Eastern Time in the Apple II RoundTable (A2) Real Time Conference 
(RTC) area.  With no long miles to drive or time away from home, PAUG 
offers the Apple II user a friendly and comfortable association with others 
of similar computing interests.  There is plenty of accurate computer 
information, hints, tips, and just plain old fashioned fun conversation.  
Along with this, you also get the security of knowing that all the 
computing support you could possibly need is right at your fingertips.  
What could be more convenient?


ANNOUNCEMENTS
"""""""""""""

Two Year Anniversary!   November 1993 was the first newsletter reflecting 
'''''''''''''''''''''   the events of the October inaugural meeting of the 
WWUG (World Wide User Group, now PAUG).  Highlights included visits from 
Tom Weishaar and Bryan Pietrzak of Softdisk/Softdisk G-S.  The next issue 
of the PAUG Newsletter (December 1995, Volume III, Number 2) will spend 
some time reminiscing about the past two years.

     Yes, it has been over two years since this brain child of Lunatic 
E'Sex sprang forth that warm July night at KFest 1993!  Thank you so much 
Luny, I hope you like what you see.

New Editor   I am pleased to say that I will be writing this newsletter on 
''''''''''   a permanent basis starting this month.  I will be providing 
reports on the PAUG monthly meetings, updates on all of our projects, and 
feedback from the PAUG membership.  I will need your support.  Please send 
your comments, ideas, and PAUG news worthy items, in email to me on GEnie 
at R.PASOLD or over the Net at r.pasold@genie.com, or if you are already 
online with GEnie (good move!) make a post in Category 3, Topic 34 
(Planetary Apple User Group) in the A2 RoundTable Bulletin Board (m645;1).

     Each month I plan to keep you informed by presenting at minimum the 
following features in the PAUG Newsletter:

     o    ANNOUNCEMENTS
          Important events and news of the next meeting.

     o    THE MAIN EVENTS
          A report of what happened at the last meeting and more.

     o    QUICK PEEK INTO THE MEETING
          A small edited portion of the RTC transcript (juicy parts).

     o    THE A2 LIBRARY
          Where you can find those marvelous files.

     o    PLEASE FEED ME!
          Short excerpts of FEEDBACK from PAUG members and myself.

     o    GOOD BUY
          Leaving you with a bargain that you will want to run right out
          and buy, is just our way of saying thanks for supporting PAUG.

The Next Meeting   The next meeting of PAUG is at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on 
''''''''''''''''   Sunday, November 19.  The following Thursday is 
Thanksgiving Day.  Join us in the celebration of the beginning of our third 
year and in a great tradition, computing on the time tested Apple II.


THE MAIN EVENTS   "Play around in PAUG" was the theme for the October 
"""""""""""""""   meeting.  What are your favorite games?  The answers 
ranged from classics that used the old DOS 3.3 operating system to 
sophisticated 16-bit GS-specific games.  The Eamon text adventure games won 
hands down as the favorite DOS 3.3 games, and almost all of them, with 
exception of the three commercial versions by Softdisk, are available right 
here in the A2 RoundTable Library!  The most recent versions are in ProDOS 
8.  Before you can play the games, you must download the Master disk and 
the Main Hall disk, with versions available in both DOS 3.3 and ProDOS.  
These Eamon games are all in the public domain, and there is no shareware 
fee.

     Battle Chess and Chessmaster were not only discussed, but members 
also wanted to know how to get them.  Since they are both commercial games 
and no longer available, the best advice is to search in the Free Trade 
Zone for used copies.  Just recently, both games were advertised for sale 
by Mr. Tracy Cook of A+ Technologies.  A demo of the Battle Chess game is 
available in the A2 library.  Chessmaster 2100 comes in both 8-bit and GS 
specific versions.  The 8-bit version is copy protected and not hard drive 
installable.  There are patches and fixes in the library so that Battle 
Chess and Chessmaster GS can be run from the Finder.  The Chessmaster 
patches include a neat icon file.  If you have the Bonus Icons file from 
Scantron Quality Computers, it includes an awesome Battle Chess icon.

     Another chess game mentioned was Sargon III.  Sargon III is only 
available for the Apple in DOS 3.3, but it is a powerful game!  You can use 
the mouse and play at level 9, however; waiting for a reply at that level 
can take over one hour on an accelerated Apple II!  This is usually not a 
problem, since most amateur players (like me) have a hard time beating 
level 2 (there are nine levels), which provides almost instant response.  
This disk is copy protected and not hard drive installable.

     All three of these chess machines are rated by the U.S. Chess 
Federation and can play you at Master Play levels.  They all provide 
tutorial games and instruction.  In Chessmaster 2100 GS, there is even the 
ability to play Speed Chess!  You can pick from 1 minute to 99 minute games 
(5 minutes is the norm), and if your clock runs to zero, Chessmaster 
promptly announces, "Your time has run out. You lose."  Amazing!


QUICK PEEK INTO THE MEETING   Let's take a quick peek into the meeting and 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   see what happened.  Of course, this is edited 
for content and confidential, so don't tell anyone!


     Notice on door: Join us and "Play around in PAUG."  What are your
     favorite games?  Do you have any good tips?  Have you downloaded a
     good game lately?  Let's talk about playing around.

     <Cindy> Hi!  Welcome to PAUG!  [Cindy is the PAUG RTC leader]

     ** <Eamon Zealot> is here.

     <Eamon Zealot> yo.

     <PATZ.PIX> howdy again, Tom.

     <Cindy> Hi Tom, Welcome to PAUG

     <Ron> Hi Tom

     <Ron> Hi John

     <Cindy> If anyone has anything to say about games - just speak up!

     <Cindy> I have an idea what Tom plays.

     <Eamon Zealot> This is where we talk about collecting pogs, right?

     <Cindy> LOL  [This means "laughing out loud"]

     <Ron> LOL!

     <Ron> Okay, Eamon games...never have tried them.

     <Cindy> Tell us a little about Eamons

     <Ron> Yeah, give us the FAQs, okay? (hehehehe)

     <Eamon Zealot> Ron, if you like text adventuring, you'll probably like
     Eamon. If not, you won't.

     <Cindy> What is Text adventuring?

     <Eamon Zealot> Text adventuring is a style of gaming in which the
     computer tells you what you see, and you type in commands to move
     about and act on objects and creatures.  The original Adventure by
     Crowther and Woods is the classic example.  The Infocom series of
     games are text adventures.

     <Ron> Like the Zork games and the old Infocom stuff, then.

     <Eamon Zealot> Yes, Ron.  Exactly.

     <Cindy> Do you have to be a rocket scientist to play them? <g>

     <Eamon Zealot> No, Cindy, you don't need to be a rocket scientist.

     <Eamon Zealot> Eamons are NOT commercial.  It's all public-domain,
     with the exception of three that were published in Softdisk.  The
     other 236 Eamons were written by ordinary people.  About half of them
     aren't so good, but the top 50 or 60 are very good.

     <Ron> I'd say one of the things that got me into computing was the
     Infocom games. I was really fascinated with them.

     <Eamon Zealot> Me too, Ron. I wasted about a year of my life playing
     every Infocom game I could afford.  I played the =original= Zork on a
     DEC PDP-11/34 back when all you could get on personal computers was
     Zork I.  The original encompassed all three Zorks.

     <Bill> Don't mean to change the subject, but does anyone know where to
     get a good chess game for the IIGS?

     <Eamon Zealot> Feel free to change the subject, Bill!  I don't know
     of any chess games for the GS.

     The conversation then went on about the chess games.  This is just an 
example of the fun and top notch information you will get when you attend a 
PAUG meeting.  Don't you wish you would have been there?


THE LIBRARY   Great games are to be found in the A2 Library.  Here's where 
"""""""""""   to get them.

     ProDOS 8:    Library 33

PLEASE FEED ME!   This is where I give a brief synopsis of all the letters

something!

     Comment on this idea.  We want to make PAUG a _membership_ user 
group.  Anyone can attend PAUG meetings and get the benefits of PAUG, but 
only official members would get things like User Group Discounts, special 
admission prices to KFest, discounts on Apple T-shirts and other products.  
The only requirement is to fill out a small form and get on our "Official 
PAUG Membership List."


NAME..................ADDRESS.......................................

TYPE OF APPLE II:...................................................

HEARD ABOUT PAUG FROM...............................................

               SIGNATURE........................DATE................


     That is all there would be.  Would you be willing to fill out the 
form and attend at least one RTC for these added benefits?  Let me know!  
There is nothing official about this and it may never happen, but we would 
like to know what you feel about it.


GOOD BUY   Willis Poole (W.POOLE) mentioned that he was seeing the new Zip 
""""""""   Drive at Direct Ware (1-800-490-WARE) for $189.  That makes this 
popular removable hard drive even more of a bargain!  If you have been 
thinking Zip, now may be the time to buy.  Thanks Willis!

[Note:  The Zip Drive was recently the topic of a Real Time Conference 
(RTC), and enough valuable information was presented that it warranted a 
special archive of the transcript.  Download file #25002 (IOMEGA.ZIP.BXY)
