Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""

    [EDITOR.A2]



                           >>> SPARED CHANGE <<<
                           """""""""""""""""""""

     Since we were last together, GEnie has shed its upper case E and 
transformed into Genie.  General Electric Information Services, Inc.
sold our host online service to Yovelle Renaissance Corp. (whoever they may 
be when they're at home).  So GEnieLamp A2 has become GenieLamp A2, much to 
the relief of hundreds of readers who hated that upper case E in the first 
place.

     There have been other changes at Genie.

     An immediate change that has caused many a voice to rise and many a 
door to be slammed is the new fee structure.  The monthly minimum of $8.95 
has been replaced by $18.95... and that's just for old-timers.  New Genie 
customers are charged $23.95/month.  The number of free non-prime time 
hours has increased from 4 to 9, and extra non-prime time hours cost $2.75, 
not $3.00.

     GenieLamp exists to promote Genie.  Nevertheless, I have to report 
that the new rates have meant several departures, from the A2 RoundTable 
and elsewhere, because customers cannot afford the $120/year increase.  I 
can't blame them, and I doubt that the majority will ever be back.  ("You 
want to come back?  Sure.  That'll be an extra $5/month for the rest of 
your stay on Genie.")  Winning back a disgruntled customer is harder even 
than finding new customers.

     This immediate change in the rates has rankled, but if the new 
management can be persuaded to offer a more affordable option, then the new 
changes will be the saving--or perhaps making--of Genie.

     Genie is a great service, and is still _the_ place to be if you own 
an Apple II.  Nevertheless, before the sale of Genie, some of us were 
worried about its future.  Genie was maintaining where it needed to grow.  
Now, Yovelle plans to carry Genie into the future.  That's fantastic news.

     If Genie is allowed to continue--if it doesn't suffer a mass exodus 
in protest at new, higher minimum fee--it will be an industry leader again.  
To achieve that, however, it must find a way of keeping its old users and 
attracting new ones.  The current fee structure is not a way of doing 
either.

     Let's hope the new management realizes it, and implements a new fee 
structure before it's too late.  If it doesn't, I may end up writing next 
month's editorial for an audience of two.

                                 [*][*][*]


     As always, my timing is impeccable--impeccably dreadful, that is.  
Last month, I urged you to write for GenieLamp A2, and dangled free Genie 
credits in front of your eyes.  One of the results of the management 
changeover is that credits are suspended until further notice.  I'm still 
eager for contributions; I simply can't pay for them, that's all.

     Two closing statements:  The PAUG Newsletter has not yet returned.  I 
don't know why (as I hoped I would when I wrote last month's editorial).

Letters To The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""



MEGADEMO FOLLOW-UP #1   You said in your February editorial:
"""""""""""""""""""""

     "So what's a major gaffe?  Assuming that Canadians and Americans are 
'the same thing'.  Assuming that Austrians and Germans are the same.  
Assuming that New Zealanders and Australians are the same.  And not knowing 
the difference between a gaffe and a faux pas. <grin>"

     I sometimes wish that Austrians and German were the same... 
Schwarzenegger being an Austrian is a major blow to my nationalist pride 
;-).  As for Kiwis and Aussies:  They talk the same, don't they, and 
anyway, where's the difference, save a few thousand miles. *ahem*

     Anyway, the reason to write (apart from sending silly comments about 
Austrian hollywood stars) is your mini-flame-fest with NinjaForce.  IMVHO, 
that piece was just a tad too long.  The original letter by NinjaForce, 
your original reply, and then maybe a short paragraph mentioning that it 
developed into a sneering match that you'll spare the reader would have 
been quite enough, I think.

     Maybe I'm oversensitive due to bad experiences on the Internet 
newsgroup csa2.  Anything that even hints at a flame gets me a bit jumpy. I 
can ignore it on csa2, it's part of the game there, but GEnie was always 
the "kinder, gentler" online service, and I would hate to see that attitude 
being undermined.  Not that your piece did a lot of mining, mind you, but 
it kind of nibbled at the edges, I think.

Cheers
Soenke Behrens
sbehrens@contech.demon.co.uk

          Yes, possibly I overreacted slightly.  I have a pronounced 
          dislike both of being told what/how I think and of being unjustly 
          accused.  My apologies to those who would rather have not 
          witnessed the exchange.--DGC


MEGADEMO FOLLOW-UP #2   I haven't finished reading the latest GEnieLamp 
"""""""""""""""""""""   yet, but want to respond to the issue of the 
MegaDemo.  I agree with you wholeheartedly!  :)

     The funny thing is that a while back I got involved in a conversation 
about this w/the author(s) on csa2.  I forget how it started, but it came 
down to me voicing my opinion that while demos are OK the first time 
around, they just aren't that useful.  I was attacked by "NinjaForce" much 
the same way you were.

     Just thought I'd give you a little moral support.  :)

Wily
P.CREAGER

          Thanks for the support, Wily.  I got letters from both sides on 
          the MegaDemo question.  That's better than apathy, as I've said 
          before.  Still, let's hope it doesn't develop into a schism.--DGC


POSSIBLE NEW APPLE II PUBLICATION   Hello World!
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     Well yes, there is another Apple II publication around.  It is called 
"Dark Castle Magazine" and is published quarterly.  We wanted to tell about 
our magazine during the fall of 1995, but it just didn't happen :-).  Maybe 
we should tell something about DDC Magazine.

     In the beginning we started a bulletin board system (a BBS) with the 
name "Deep Dark Castle", but we finally left "Deep" away.  It runs METAL/ 
FutureVision and joins the Futurenet network.

     After a few months we realized that not every Apple II owner has a 
modem and could join our BBS and participate in any discussion or read 
about 'things going on in Apple II-land'.  So we started publishing a disk 
with software that had been uploaded to the BBS or had been sent in by 
mail.  We found that this wasn't enough, so we started publishing a 
magazine AND a disk.

     So far so good, but this was all in Dutch and we got requests from 
foreign people to send them a copy.  Because of several people there was no 
reason to switch to the English language, but more requests started coming 
in.  This made us think.  Why not publish in English?  GS+ had gone, 
Softdisk Apple II and others also.

     But, we weren't the only ones who thought this:  Juiced-GS, The 
AppleWorks Gazette and Apple Blossom hit the scene.  This made us think 
again:  is it needed to bring another publication?  Well, we finally made 
up our decision:  it is up to you.

     Would YOU like to see another publication for the Apple II only?  
Would YOU like to subscribe?  Maybe some information about Dark Castle 
Magazine will interest you.

Dark Castle Magazine   Published quarterly, currently in Dutch.  If enough 
''''''''''''''''''''   requests come in, the June '96 issue will be 
published in English (and the next ones too, of course).

     What is covered in each issue depends on what is sent in, or what we 
wrote during the last quarter.  However, in each issue we discuss a column 
called 'modem talk'.  It contains information about the use of modems and 
telecommunication on your Apple II.  A pending item is the Video Grabber.  
This is a new card for the Apple IIgs that will grab video frames in real 
time (in the background) while running GS/OS.

     On the disk you will find self written programs, self made sounds, 
midi files, pictures and other (interesting) software.  These disks are 
available on the ftp site Caltech (ftp.cco.caltech.edu) in the 
pub/apple2/incoming directory.  [Editor's note:  This address was accurate 
when this letter was written, but may not be accurate by the time you read 
this.]  The files are called ddc01.shk through ddc05.shk.  DDC06 will be 
put online at the end of March 1996 when it's finished.  So you can check 
them out yourself.  Of course we can send you one or more disks by mail, 
but you pay the shipping :-)

     There is a lot more to tell you about, but we have no international 
information sheet ready yet.  It will soon be requestable by email.

     If YOU are interested, please email us!  We will mail you more 
information back including subscription ratings (including shipping).  When 
we switch to English, the disks won't be put on Caltech anymore because 
they are part of the magazine.

APPLECOLOR RGB MONITOR FIXES   Several Quick and Simple fixes for 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   AppleColor RGB monitor problems

     Notice:  All of these repairs require removing the back case of the 
monitor, and some amount of soldering.  If you are not confident of your 
abilities to handle this enviroment have someone else who is confident and 
qualified perform the needed repairs.

     There are potentially lethal shock hazards exposed during these 
procedures, as well as CRT implosion hazards.  Proper safety procedures 
should be followed.  These instructions are presented here as reference 
materials for properly qualified service technicians to make use of.  I 
shall NOT, in ANY MANER, be liable, or held liable, for any injuries, to 
anyone, or any piece of equipment, occuring while following these 
directions.
==========================================================================

Symptom:  The entire screen lights up with one color.

Fix:  Obtain three 10uh (10 micro henry) inductors (Radio Shack often has 
these available, usually less than $5.00 for all three).  Use these to 
replace L6R2, L6G2, and L6B2, all three of which are found on the PC board 
that is mounted to the neck of the CRT.  (No adjustments of anything should 
be required)  All three should be replaced at the same time, as field 
reports indicate that once one has burned out, the other two aren't far 
behind.

Note:  These three inductors are used in series with the collector load 
resistor on the three gun driver output transistors, they simply perform 
power supply decoupling between the colors.  When one of these inductors 
opens up, the collector of the associated gun driver transistor is no 
longer connected to it's source of power, causing the transistor's bias to 
go nuts (due to electron impingment on the grid)  This causes the one color 
that has to open inductor to become biased full-on.  This CAN CAUSE 
PERMENENT DAMAGE the CRT, do NOT leave the power on for longer than needed 
to observe the symptom.

     Also note that it is normal for the PC board near these inductors to 
be somewhat discolored from heat (being dissipated by the noted collector 
load resistors)
===============

Symptom:  The entire screen slowly fades to black, sometimes comes back 
          (full or partially) when the case is slapped.  [In some cases the 
          screen may never show anything at all, but if one checks with the 
          back of the hand it will be noted that there is a considerable 
          static charge on the face of the CRT]

Fix #1:  After unplugging the PC board from the neck of the CRT (slicing 
thru the blob of silicone rubber if present) clean the pins of the CRT with 
a tarnish removal chemical such as Tarn-X.  Reassemble and test after 
drying.

Note #1:  While I have not seen this procedure needed on the AppleColor RGB 
monitor, I have done this to fix several "fishtank" style Macs as well as 
televisions.  It's a cheap longshot that can save a LOT of time and effort 
when it does work.  Call it Majik and bill accordingly ;-)

Fix #2:  After unplugging the PC board from the neck of the CRT (slicing 
thru the blob of silicone rubber if present) inspect and resolder every pin 
on the CRT socket where it connects to the PC board, also resolder both 
ends of R636.  DO NOT try resoldering these connections with the board 
still plugged onto the CRT as the heat conducted into the CRT along the 
pins may cause it to implode, causing severe injury!

Note#2:  The solder joints on the pins of the CRT socket sometimes crack, 
causing poor / intermitent contact and operation.  Usually caused by 
blocked cooling and excessive operating temperature

Fix#3:  After unplugging the PC board from the neck of the CRT (slicing 
thru the blob of silicone rubber if present) test R636 with an ohm meter.  
This is a 1.2 ohm, 2 watt ceramic / sand resistor, which is in series with 
the CRT's filiment.  If it is open, replace it with a like part.  Be 
certain to mount the replacement away from the board, for proper heat 
disipation.

Note#3:  This resistor fails due to excessive heat, and normal thermal 
cycling over a long period of time (many on/off cycles)

Fix #4:  Locate the horizontal output transformer (flyback) and resolder 
all of it's pins on the bottom of the lower PC board, paying particular 
attention to pins 6 and 9 (these provide filiment voltage to the CRT)

Note#4:  The solder joints on the pins of the horizontal output transformer 
sometimes crack, causing poor / intermitent contact and operation.  Usually 
caused by blocked cooling and excessive operating temperature, but can also 
be agravated by magneticly induced motion (on a micro scale) which is 
directly related to the horizontal output frequency of 15.750Khz.  This 
problem is also prevalent on many other monitors, TV sets, and in 
particular, the older "fishtank style" Macs.

Overall Note:  If you sliced thru the blob of silicone rubber that keeps 
the board attached to the CRT, it is a good idea to re-glue things with a 
fresh blob of silicone rubber, as was done originally.  This will keep the 
board in place when the monitor is moved or shipped.  (A good grade of RTV 
or 100% silicone rubber bathtub caulk is desirable)
===========

Symptom:  Monitor appears to be totally dead.  No power light, no "thump" 
          at turn-on, no static charge noted on face of CRT.

Caution:  This procedure involves working in an area of the monitor that is 
          NOT isolated from the power line.  Be CERTAIN to unplug the 
          monitor EVERY time prior to putting even one hand into these 
          areas!

Fix:  Check the internally mounted power line fuse located on the lower 
board near where the power cord enters.  If it is bad try a replacement of 
the same current and voltage ratings.  If the replacement fuse blows almost 
immediately:

     a) Locate the connector for the auto degausing coil (near front edge 
        of lower board, same side as fuse) and unplug it.  Retest with a 
        new fuse.  If all is now well the degausing coil should be replaced 
        as it's shorted.

     b) Desolder and remove RP901 (near front of monitor, same side as 
        fuse), and retest with a new fuse installed.  If all is now well, 
        RP901 needs to be replaced (it's a glowbar / thermistor which 
        controls current thru the automatic CRT degausing coil at turn on, 
        these are rather generic and readily available at many TV repair 
        shops)

     If removal of RP901 did not eliminate fuse blowing, then reinstall 
it, as it's probably Ok.  The problems lie elsewhere and will require 
further diagnostic skills on your part.  (Checking all components in the 
power supply, especially electrolytic capacitors will likely reveal the 
problem. Also check the horizontal output transistor for shorts)
==========

Symptom:  Single horizontal or vertical line line on screen

Fix #1:  Check the connector between the deflection yoke and the lower PC 
board.  Also check the bottom of the board around this connector for 
cracked solder joints, resoldering as needed.

Fix#2:  If the line is horizontal, and you have been working inside the 
monitor, check the Service Switch, which is located on the PC board on the 
neck of the CRT, middle of the edge directly over the power cord.  It is 
very easy to bump this switch accidentally.  This is a three position 
switch, it should be in the middle position for normal use.

FREEWARE/SHAREWARE CATALOG   Well, in a very round about way, I've just had 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   a solution of sorts handed to me concerning 
SSII's lack of having any sort of printed catalog of freeware/shareware 
software.

     SSII is going to take over the entire BRCC library of 
freeware/shareware.  For years, BRCC has had a real nice looking catalog of 
those library disks.  So, BRCC is also planning to send me a printed master 
of that catalog, with all references about BRCC removed.  I'll be able to 
add a new cover with SSII ordering info, and presto...SSII will have a 
massive freeware/ shareware printed catalog.

     Although it's certainly not going to be a complete catalog of disks 
available from SSII, it'll be a heckuva good start.

     I like word-around solutions <grin>.  Hmmm...this is a work-around 
shareware solution. That has a certain ring to it...

STAR TREK RSOUNDS UPDATE   Someone recently reported here that EGO Systems

     Firstly, they no longer offer the Star Trek sounds for the GS _or_ the
MAC...only for Windows.  This is due to the 'rights' having been pulled 
from them.  This won't prevent one from buying the Windows version and 
having someone with Windows to run the dedicated application that 
uncompresses them to a .BMP format, and then bringing them over to the GS.

     Secondly, they have _lots_ of stuff, both for the MAC and Windows.  
The sound oriented stuff includes...

          Star Trek "Virtual Reality" Audioclips
          Star Trek Motion Picture Audioclips
          Star Trek: TNG "Virtual Reality" Audioclips

APPLE II CODENAME HISTORY LESSON   Actually, Cortland was the code name, or 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   internal name, for the Apple IIGS.  It 
was one of many (like Gumby, for example).  It was imortalized by the 
simple coincidence that it was the code name when some enterprising person 
at Apple decided to have some labels made up to replace the standard 
"Apple" name that appears imbedded in the lid of an Apple //e.  These 
labels were used on the covers for the very early prototype Apple IIGS 
computers that were mounted in Apple //e case tops--the back and bottom was 
changed.

     Later prototype models used a standard Apple //e lid, going back to 
the original top label for security reasons.  After all, when it's off, an 
Apple IIGS motherboard mounted in an Apple //e case looks just like an 
Apple //e-- from the front, at least.

     Perhaps because of it's ensrinement in hardware, Cortlan stuck around 
for a long time as a code name.  The original versions of ORCA for the 
Apple IIGS that Apple published under their label were known as CPW, for 
Cortland Programmer's Workshop.  There was a bitter debate at Apple before 
the final name was changed to APW.  Why?  Cortland fanatics, you suppose?  
Nope.  The MPW team (Macintosh Programmer's Workshop) didn't want an Apple 
][ product to carry the "company" name! Sensibility and the fact that the 
_computer_ was called Apple won the day.  :)

     By the time the Apple IIGS was in an Apple IIGS, the name Apple IIGS 
was decided for sure.  The initial ROM 00 Apple IIGS computers were not 
called Cortland, which, after all, was never intended to be anything but a 
code name.

     As an aside, though, Macintosh was also a code name.  The name stuck 
(along with the mispelling) because so much had leaked about the new 
"Macintosh" computer that Apple didn't want to loose the name recognition!

RAMFAST IIe   I've had my RamFAST IIe for several weeks now.  Here are a 
"""""""""""   few observations.

     1.  It works well in a ROM3 GS.

     2.  It works well in an enhanced //e _without_ a ZIP8.

     3.  It doesn't work in an enhanced //e with a ZIP8.  Yup, I've tried 
five different //e's (various vintages) and five different Zips (various 
vintages).  If the Zip is in the machine (fast or slow) the system hangs.  
And it hangs well, too.  Even if you reset out of the hang, and attempt to 
boot from a floppy, it crashes to the monitor.  Take out the Zip, and all 
is well.

     Number 3 is especially disappointing, as I have several Zipped II'e 
at work that could really use a RamFAST.  SS told me they thought it would 
work.  They have been aware of the problem for about 3 weeks, but I'm 
beginning to believe that they aren't going to be able to fix it.  I even 
offered to send them one of my spare Zip Chips.

     Oh well.  I'm sure glad it works in a GS, albeit at slightly higher 
power consumption.

     BTW, you guys were right.  The difference between the HS SCSI and the 
RamFAST, especially under P8, is amazing.  Really amazing.

RETURN OF THE CALTECH APPLE II ARCHIVE   Found this on 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Usenet.comp.sys.apple2 today:

Sat Feb 24 09:10:18 1996
Message : #39728534    From: Daniel Zimmerman

Group   : Usenet.comp.sys.apple2
Subject : Return of the Caltech Apple II Archive!

Org.  : California Institute of Technology, Pasadena

     The Caltech Apple II Archive is back!  I have taken the archive and 
given it a new home on my own machine, with the help of EGO Systems (who 
graciously donated a copy of their "Shrink II" Macintosh application so I 
could use it for file validation and maintenance)...  Space on the archive 
is no longer at a premium, so the submission rules have changed somewhat 
(they're in README.UPLOADS)...  Also, a couple of niceties have been added 
(one of them being that the server will warn you if it thinks you uploading 
_or_ downloading in the wrong transfer mode)...

     The archive's new address is "apple2.caltech.edu" (this is an alias 
which currently points to my machine, but which will, in the future, follow 
the archive around).  I am running both an ftp and a gopher server, so 
either can be used to access the archive (I don't expect a whole lot of 
gopher users, but I figured, hey, it's no extra work on my part :)... WWW 
access to the archive may also be available in the future.

     Currently, there is a limit of 15 simultaneous users on the server.  
This is because, in addition to serving the Apple II Archive, my machine is 
also serving RealAudio for the Roxette Home Page, and I want to go easy at 
first to see how it handles the extra load.  I will increase the limit if I 
see that it isn't a problem.

     Thanks to everybody who sent me e-mail asking for the archive's 
return - that's the main thing that finally convinced me to do it... :)

     Enjoy, and please e-mail any comments/questions/problems to me...

NEW GENIE RATES   I had a conversation with one of my regular e-mail 
"""""""""""""""   friends tonight.  He has canceled his GEnie account and 
had a difficult time doing it too.

     He only used his GEnie account for a few hours a month, never quite 
going over his allotted free time and he doesn't see ever using nine hours 
a month.  He called GEnie client services and was told that this month the 
cost would go up to $18.95/month, then in March it would go up to about 
$29/month.  This would be with the nine hours free time.  But for a user 
that only needed a few hours a month, this is no longer a good deal, and my 
friend and many other GEnie users, from what he was told by the gentleman 
taking the calls from Rochester, NY, are canceling their accounts.

     My friend liked GEnie because he wasn't forced to use a graphic 
interface, the reason was simple, my friend is visually impaired, and he 
can format his text display to suit his visual needs, he cannot use the 
typical graphical interface used for a lot of internet access because it 
isn't scalable like his text screen, he also can't track an arrow to point 
and click on a menu that is spread around various points on the screen.

     He can still use a lot of local BBSs, but they don't have the mail 
capabilities that GEnie had, which was his primary use.  He can get local 
unlimited Internet access for a little as 10/month here, he doesn't want to 
since he can't see the screens well enough to make good use of them, but 
GEnie's restructuring of their prices has forced him off the system.

     We also discussed the new Telecommunications bill and our increasing 
cable rates (with decreasing service)........but I won't go into that...:)

     Fortunately I use enough GEnie time to make the price hike less 
painful than it will be for a lot of folks, so it's not going to change my 
use much.  But then, I just bought a Mac LC used (as a peripheral for my 
//gs and Newton ;)

PREMIERE ISSUE OF JUICED.GS   I am pleased to announce that the premier
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   issue of Juiced.GS was mailed to subscribers 
early Monday afternoon.  It will soon be arriving in a mail box near you.

     I encountered a production delay late last week when Murphy's Law 
kicked in.  First, the FedEx overnight package from Lincoln, Nebraska, 
containing the master pages took three days to arrive. :(  Heavy fog in the 
Midwest apparently kept air-cargo planes from making their appointed 
rounds.  When the package finally arrived, I discovered that the HP 
DeskWriter 550C on which the master pages were created performed some 
unforeseen modifications to the text.  The biggest problems occurred with 
formatted text (bold face, italics, centering, right justification, etc).  
It took some tedious cutting and pasting to correct the more obvious flaws.

     Now I'm ready to forget all that, and I hope the first issue of 
Juiced.GS meets with everyone's satisfaction.  :)

     I'll be looking forward to lots and lots of feedback.  Let me know 
what you think, what's good, what's not, and what you'd like to see covered 
in future issues.

     For those who have not yet subscribed but would like to, I remind you 
that a special charter subscription rate of $12 in the U.S. and Canada and 
$18 elsewhere for the four 1996 issues is available to Genie A2 members 
until March 15.  After that, the regular subscription rate of $14 ($20

<<<<<   Following is a detailed list of the differences between
"""""   GraphicWriter III version 1.1 and version 2.0.

General   GraphicWriter III version 2.0 requires System 6.
'''''''
     The GraphicWriter III application icon is now contains everything you 
need--the separate "GW.Resources" file can be deleted.

     Most of GraphicWriter III's dialog boxes are now "moveable, modal" 
dialog boxes, meaning you can move them around the screen.

     Dialog boxes can be navigated using the keyboard.  Return or Enter is 
a shortcut for clicking the button with the extra ring around it.  Escape 
or Command-Period is a shortcut for clicking the Cancel button.

     The horizontal and vertical rulers now show marks every 1/16th inch 
instead of every 1/10th inch.

     Dragging out a new guide while the screen is updating used to cause 
the guide to be offset from the mouse position; now it stays under the 
mouse.

     Select portions of code were re-written or optimized, squeaking out 
some extra speed for certain operations.

     Much of GraphicWriter III was rewritten to use newer System features 
(such as the Resource Manager), resulting in a smaller program on disk.

     When you double-click a GraphicWriter III document in the Finder, 
GraphicWriter III is launched and the document is opened.

Apple Menu
''''''''''
-=> Help

     New feature!  Choosing Help from the Apple menu opens a window that 
displays help topics for GraphicWriter III.  Select a topic from the popup 
menu to read more about that topic.

File Menu
'''''''''
-=> Close

     This menu item now responds to the standard Command-W shortcut key 
(previously Command-W changed the View to Fit In Window...now use Command-0 
(zero) to choose Fit In Window).

     The "save changes" dialog box is redesigned.

-=> Export / Import

     When beginning an export or import, GraphicWriter III plays the sound 
associated with the "beginning long operation" event.  When the process is 
complete the "operation complete" event sound is played.

-=> Print

     You are now notified if an error occurs while printing.

     While printing, GraphicWriter III tells Twilight II to use background 
(i.e. friendly) blanking if it decides to blank.

Edit Menu   The standard system clipboard is now supported, so you can Copy 
'''''''''   and Paste text and graphics between GraphicWriter III and other 
applications or desk accessories!

-=> Paste

     If the system clipboard contains text, Paste lets you paste that text 
into any typing frame (just as if you had copied the text from within 
GraphicWriter III).

     If the system clipboard contains a IIGS PICTure (e.g. while in 
Platinum Paint you copied an image to the clipboard, then you launched 
GraphicWriter III) Paste inserts a new "picture" object into the document.  
This picture object can be resized without losing any of its original 
quality.

     TIP:  After copying a picture in Platinum Paint, paste it into 
GraphicWriter III.  While the new picture object is selected choose Object 
Specs from the Object menu, then click the 1/2 or 1/4 button to reduce the 
picture to exactly 1/2 or 1/4 its original size.  This will yield 
exceptional print quality from high quality printers.

     Currently there is no way to directly create or import a Picture 
object in GraphicWriter III.  To create a picture object you must copy a 
picture from Platinum Paint, then Paste that picture into GraphicWriter 
III.

-=> Spelling

     The dialog box has been changed to provide a much larger area in 
which to display the context of the spelling error.

     Most of the spelling code has been rewritten, and we believe the 
infamous "Possible Choices" bug has finally been squashed!

     Curly apostrophes are handled correctly.  Previously don't (with a 
straight apostrophe) would not be shown as a suspect word, but don't (with 
a curly apostrophe) would be.

     The spell checker recognizes foreign characters and special symbols 
correctly.

-=> Preferences

     The "Show Frames" option (checked by default) now shows dotted lines 
around painting frames, as well as typing frames.  With this change, new 
painting frames now start with the Pen color set to None (i.e. no border 
will be visible unless you select the Arrow tool, click on the painting 
frame, then choose a Pen color).

     Preferences are now stored in the "*:System:Preferences:" folder, or 
in the user's folder if using AppleShare.

Font Menu   The Font menu is now "standard" so it will work with utilities 
'''''''''   such as our nifty "Super Menu Pack"!

     All the fonts available in your system are listed alphabetically on 
the Font menu.  The menu will be scrollable if you have more fonts than 
will fit on the screen.

-=> Choose Font

     This option presents the standard Choose Font dialog box, where you 
can select a Font, Style, and Size all in one step!

Object Menu
'''''''''''
-=> Object Specs

     This new feature lets you position and size an object by exact 
numbers! Common reductions (1/2 and 1/4) and common enlargements (2x and 
4x) are provided just by clicking a button.

Page Menu
'''''''''
-=> Snap To Guides

     The snapping code was greatly improved so that objects will snap to 
the same position even if they are slightly left/right or above/below the 
guide being snapped to.

-=> Insert Pages

     In the document window, clicking "+" in the "- Page +" area moves to 
the next page (as it did before).  What's new:  If the last page of the 
document is currently being shown, the "Insert Pages" dialog box appears 
automatically so you can insert new pages.

-=> Copy Master Guides

     This new feature erases all the guides on the current page, and 
replaces them with an exact copy of all the guides from the appropriate 
master page (see Master Pages in the original manual's index).

Extras Menu   This menu is new, and only appears if there are GraphicWriter 
'''''''''''   III extras installed that ask to be added to this menu.

     Currently there are no extras available, but the capability now 
exists to extend GraphicWriter III's functionality without having to 
release a whole new version.

APPLE COMPUTER ON RECENT MEDIA REPORTS AND SECOND-QUARTER OUTLOOK
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     CUPERTINO, California--February 8, 1996--In response to recent media 
reports, Apple Computer, Inc. today stated that it is not currently in 
merger discussions with any party. 

     The company stated: "It has been our long-standing policy not to 
comment on rumor and speculation, and that continues to be the case. 
Because of the destabilizing effect recent rumors and speculation have had 
on our business and our organization, we have decided in this one instance, 
however, to make an exception to our policy."

     Apple reported that as a result of the adverse impact of such rumors 
and speculation on customer buying decisions, as well as other market 
factors, the company expects to report an operating loss for its second 
quarter that will significantly exceed its first-quarter operating loss of 
$69 million. In addition, the company stated that it expects to record 
certain second-quarter charges related to its previously announced business 
restructuring program, and other charges related to inventory adjustments, 
as it continues to take the steps necessary to position itself for a return 
to profitability and for long-term business success. 

     Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio, Apple chairman and chief executive officer, 
said: "I want to emphasize my strong belief, despite the obvious 
disappointment of our performance in the first and second quarters, that 
the foundations of our business are sound, and that Apple Computer has the 
ability, determination and staying power to deal with current challenges 
and to move forward with confidence into the future. 

     "In order to remain competitive at all levels while retaining our 
ability to develop and bring to market leading-edge technologies, 
particularly in the areas of multimedia, Internet, graphics and 
ease-of-use, we will continue building our strengths in the education, 
home, business, and other market segments. 

     "I am confident that the actions we will be taking in the weeks and 
months ahead will result in increasing profitability in those markets where 
we already excel, and significantly improve our overall business 
proposition going forward.  I fully expect that our customers' 
grandchildren will be buying Apple products," Amelio said. 

     Last Friday, Apple announced that its Board of Directors had put in 
place new management leadership, appointing Dr. Amelio, an Apple board 
member and previously chairman, president and chief executive officer of 
National Semiconductor Corporation, as chairman and chief executive officer 
of Apple. 

     The statements herein concerning second-quarter results are 
preliminary and are based on partial information and management 
assumptions.  The company will announce its actual results for the second 
quarter in April. 

     Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters 
discussed in this news release are forward-looking statements that involve 
risks and uncertainties.  Potential risks and uncertainties include without 
limitation continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the effect 
any reaction to such competitive pressures has on inventory valuations; the 
effect of any further adverse publicity; and the need for and any effect of 
any business restructuring actions.  Further information on potential 
factors that could affect the company's financial results will be included 
in the company's Form 10-Q for its 1996 first quarter, to be filed with the 
SEC.

WEB BROWSER FOR THE IIGS   I got to talking with Derek Tauber today on the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   undernet irc, and he asked me to 'publicize' the 
following on GEnie.  I decided to post here first...1) to see what topic

     If you could spread this around genie, I'd be most thankful!

--------8<--------8<--------8<--------

     Very good news for those interested in TCP/IP access for the Apple 
IIgs.  I have just completed an initial port of CERN's LineMode Web Browser 
to the IIgs, and it is functional!  The LineMode Browser is a simple text 
based browser based on CERN's WWW Library.  Using the LineMode browser, 
information can be retrieved via many protocols such as http, ftp, gopher, 
and nntp.

     My port of the WWW Library (almost 40,000 lines of C code) in 
cooperation with GS/TCP and GNO will make it feasible for a graphical based 
web browser to be written for the Apple IIgs.

     In addition, I have also completed an initial port of the public PPP 
package to run under GS/TCP.  It is still in the testing phase, but I have 
been able to establish a connection and use GS/TCP utilities such as ftp 
over the connection.

     I apologize that the work I have done is not yet available to the 
public.  I am very busy finishing up my Master's degree, and will work on 
GS/TCP whenever I get a chance.  I am very close!

     All of this information and links at:

WEB BROWSER FOR 8-BIT APPLES?   Well, actually, I AM working on getting a 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   text based web browser for the IIe.  
(Anything that runs a 6502, actually.)  I say "working on getting" because 
_I_ (obviously :) am not the one doing it, and, further, it is being 
developed by someone outside the Apple II community.

     I'm being mysterious here, and I hate it when other people do that, 
but in this case, I don't have any real choice.  I'm not exactly sworn to 
secrecy, but I don't actually HAVE details.  I was approached by someone 
that I know and trust to see if there would be sufficient interest to 
justify a port.  I responded enthusiastically.  I was advised that I would 
be told more when it was appropriate to let me know. 

     BUT, this is definitely in the works at this time.  If I understand 
it correctly, this will be 6502 machine code that handles TCP/IP protocols.

     Again, we're talking text mode only.

BRUTAL DELUXE ON THE MOVE   For those of you who prefer to do your Internet 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   downloading using lynx...I've just updated my 
homepage links so you can now download from the new caltech archive. 
http://www.crl.com/~joko

     On another subject, Olivier Zardini of Brutal Deluxe will be arriving 
at the Shareware Solutions II Worldwide Headquarters sometime on Thursday.  
Since he does not have access to GEnie from France, the first thing I'd 
like to do with him is set up a time for an RTC.

     I've already spoke to A2.Gena about it, and she says that the more 
notice I can give, the better it will be.  So on Thursday, I hope to nail 
down a convenient time with Olivier and will immediately contact A2.Gena so 
she can set up the appropriate banners.

     In any case, whether it's a "formal" RTC, or an impromptu one, Brutal 
Deluxe will be here on A2 to chat with you sometime during the next 2 
weeks.

     FYI, Brutal Deluxe has just released a brand new Apple IIGS CD-ROM, 
which is currently for sale only in France, as all the information on it is 
in French.  We'll be discussing the best way to make that CD available to 
people outside of France.  Additionally, I look forward to seeing their 
latest game, which is nearing completion.

MORE INTERNATIONAL RUMOURS   [Olivier Zardini]'ll be in the San Francisco 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Bay Area for about 2 weeks.  But, the details 
that came through in e-mail were just a little sketchy.  I believe he'll be 
here until March 10th.

     So if anyone has any technical questions about Convert 3200, or about 
the source code, or about Brutal Deluxe's new CD-ROM, now would be a great 
time to ask them.

     Speaking of International Apple II news, I received some outstanding 
news today.  MS-DOS Utilities will be available in a few months as a New 
Desk Accessory.

Joe  
                  (JOE.KOHN, CAT28, TOP4, MSG:59/M645;1)


BALLOON UPDATE?   OK, I spent a couple of hours today looking into the 
"""""""""""""""   possibility of a Balloon update.  Joe had already been 
working on this when the end came, and it's actually in pretty good shape.  
He had fixed a couple of bugs, and added one or two  small new features, 
and I just fixed another bug myself....

     So, what I'm getting at is:  Should I release just this bug fix 
version, or should I spend a couple of weeks putting in some new features?  
Either way, I'll have to charge for it.  If it's just the bug fix, it'll be 
less than $10 but if I put in the new features, it'll be at least $10 for 
the update.

     Specifically, the new features I want to put in are:

          1) Encode/Decode BinSCII
          2) Support for Disk Archives
          3) Support for other Apple II archive formats

     Basically, I want to bring the feature set up to par with the 
features in Shrink II.... (minus the apple events of course :-) )

     Oh, yeah, someone once reported a problem with scripting Balloon from 
Spectrum (I THINK it was a problem with Adding files to archives via a 
script), but I've lost the bug report.  If you've had this problem, or 
you're the person that reported it, PLEASE send me details so that I can 
investigate and hopefully fix it.

Message 275       Sun Feb 04, 1996
M.WADE7 [Mark]               at 13:31 EST
 
     I acquired my first computer, an unenhanced Apple //e, in August, 
1992. 128k, 80 columns, 2 Disk II drives, and an Apple DMP printer, with a 
box of diskettes, all pirated.  The disk drives had a problem and erased 
most of those disks (poetic justice I guess).  I had a local Apple dealer 
repair the drive to the tune of about $300 for what I think was just a bad 
cable, cause when they demoed the repair it erased his disk :)  They then 
replaced the ribbon cable for a mere $40.  Thus the beginning of my 
computer learning experience.

     I took out what the library had to offer, took a subscription to 
Incider/A+, and found a fairly local user group that I joined.  I found an 
ad in Incider/A+ for Resource Central offering books so I bought the 8 bit 
ref. manuals and subscribed to A2 Central and bought all their back issues.  
There I learned of GEnie's A2 RT and was told that was where I should be, 
so I bought a Super Serial Card clone and a refurbished 2400 baud modem 
from Alltech and signed on somewhere around December, 1992.

     I have learned more from the A2 RT than any other source that I dug, 
scratched and clawed for these past 3+ years ( I can't believe it's been 
that long).  I can't imagine using my II's without the A2 RT.

     When I first signed on here, with the old pricing structure and a 
2400 baud modem, my bills were typically between $25 and $35.  More 
recently, with the previous pricing and a 14.4k modem, I vary from about 
$10 to about $15.  The savings were nice but I'm certainly not going to 
drop my account because things are back to where they were a year or so 
ago, and believe me, my finances right now are pretty p*ss poor.  Where 
would I go?  CSA2 ?  Please, that's an added distraction but certainly 
would never replace GEnie's A2 RT.

     BTW  I've bought new from vendors where possible and used here from 
GEnie and the //e is now enhanced with 1mb Qram, Grappler+, Super Serial 
Card, Seq Sys bit mouse, Vtech Universal Disk Controller, Apple HS SCSI 
connected to a CMS 20mb hard drive, and a 20mb Focus IDE Hard Card along 
with a fairly impressive bit of software I think, and, oh yeah, an 8mhz Zip 
Chip. :)  But my real prize is a Rom 1 IIgs with 12/64 ZipGSX, Grappler+, 
AST VisionPlus, Quickie scanner, Audio Animator, RamFAST, 8mb RAM, 170mb 
LaCie, Apple CD150, and an Iomega Zip100, oh yeah, and an Apple MIDI 
interface.  Of course all my clothes have holes in them but I have to keep 
my priorities straight :)

     I have a complete set of reference manuals, 2 assemblers and a C 
compiler and as long I can keep it all running I'll be hobbying with it. I 
can't think of a better place to help me do that than here.

     P.S.  Froggie,  I quit smoking cigarettes years ago.  Please don't 
say I have to cut back on the beer.  NAHH!

>>> INCLUDING NURSING HOMES IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE <<<
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Last weekend I went to visit my aunt who lives in a nursing home 
about 120 miles from me.  I went to sing songs with her because music is 
the one thing she still takes a great deal of joy in.  At the age of 65, 
ten years ago, she took up the guitar and became a real fan of 1960s folk 
songs.  She learned almost every Woody Guthrie, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and 
Malvina Reynolds song ever written.  She sang them all with great gusto at 
family gatherings.

     Now her Alzheimer's leaves her too frail to pick up a guitar, yet she 
sings along with the same enthusiasm when I sit beside her and strum.  I 
thought that an hour's worth of singing might be too much for her, so I 
regularly asked her if she was feeling too tired.  "Not too tired," she 
would faintly reply each time I asked her.  I looked over at her tired 
visage to check to see that she wasn't just being polite.  Assured that I 
wasn't taxing her energies too much, I continued on through the song book.

     After an hour and a half of singing we reached the African spiritual 
"Kumbaya."  We started singing the song together, but I noticed that her 
voice trailed off with each passing chorus.  By the end of the song I 
looked over at her and noticed she was sleeping.

     As the rest of the country focuses its energies on hooking up schools 
and libraries to the Internet, I do hope that decision makers consider the 
importance of hooking up nursing homes, too.  What does it mean for a 
nursing home to have a high-speed Internet connection?  It means that a 
nephew in Washington DC can sing songs to an aunt in Philadelphia via a 
videoconference connection.  It means that a day filled with loneliness and 
boredom is filled with less loneliness and less boredom.

     Currently I visit my aunt no more than two or three times per year.  
If I could, I would visit with her two or three times per week.  As 
inexpensive videoconferencing become more and more affordable, the latter 
option becomes more and more feasible.  But in our rush to wire schools and 
libraries, our society may be overlooking a segment of the population that 
stands to benefit immeasurably by a high-speed Internet connection.

     I'm not only talking about the residents of nursing home.  I'm 
talking about their families and friends and the courageous workers at 
nursing homes and anyone else who takes an interest in the well-being of 
the frail elderly.  This is not to say that a videoconferenced visit offers 
as much joy and emotional-nourishment as an in-person visit.  But 
videoconferencing offers the hope of more frequent visits, and the 
frequency of visits is emotional currency to people in nursing homes.

     With my aunt sleeping peacefully in her bed I leaned her guitar 
against the wall at the foot of her bed, put on my jacket, and quietly 
closed the door behind me.  Walking down the hallway outside her room the 
melody of Kumbaya circled around in my head.  And so did the thought that 
in wiring our country we need to do far more to take the lyrics of this 
song to heart.  "Come by here, my lord. Come by here."

/////////////////////////////////
Premiere Issue of The AppleWorks Gazette
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     Christian Serreau of France and Howard Katz of Illinois, U.S.A. have 
launched _The AppleWorks Gazette_, an AppleWorks magazine on disk.  The 
premiere issue appeared in January 1996.

     Last year was not a great year for AppleWorks newsletters.  Both 
_TimeOut-Central_ and the National AppleWorks User Group's _AppleWorks 
Forum_ ceased publication in 1995.  Serreau and Katz are doing their part 
to make 1996 look brighter.

     There are three parts to the first issue of the Gazette:  the 
newsletter itself, software, and data.  You can easily read the 
newsletter--which is, naturally, an AppleWorks word processor file--either 
with AppleWorks 5.x or with the enclosed QuickView program.  If you choose 
to read the file from within AppleWorks 5.x, there's a browser that you can 
launch from your TimeOut menu.

NEWSLETTER   Here are the contents of the first issue: 
""""""""""
     1.  Welcome to the AppleWorks Gazette! [introduction to the magazine]
     2.  The Main Menu [introduction to the disk and its contents]
     3.  The NewsReel
     4.  Duplicate Zapping Made Easy: a Review of TO.DupeFinder
     5.  Software Preview: Deja ][
     6.  Twelve Features I Wish I Had in AppleWorks 5.1
     7.  Two CD ROMS for the Apple II
     8.  How to reach us
     9.  Subscription information

     My favorite article is Serreau's wish list of features for 
AppleWorks.  It required some thought on the part of the author, and it's 
something you won't find in every other Apple II journal.  I also admired 
the preview of Deja ][ for its in-depth, nuts-and-bolt approach.

     The NewsReel presents news from the Apple II world, with the 
AppleWorks-related news given prominence.  This item and the review of the 
Digisoft Golden Orchard CD-ROM and AUGE CD #1 bored me just a little, since 
I'd already gone into most of this information elsewhere.

     The Gazette is clearly aimed at the up-to-date and fairly 
knowledgeable AppleWorks user.  The word processor file will load into 
AppleWorks 3.0 and 4.3, but not without a few cosmetic glitches.  Serreau 
and Katz use inverse in their titles--to good effect!--but the upper case 
inverse characters won't look nice unless you're using AppleWorks 5.x.  If 
you're not up to date with AppleWorks, you show use the supplied QuickView 
program instead.  The supplied browser also assumes AppleWorks 5.x.  It 
won't crash if you try to use it with AppleWorks 4.x--for which the editors 
are to be commended--but it won't work, either.

     If you don't have MouseText in your Apple IIe, you won't find the 
Gazette attractive.  Now that it's easy to use inverse and MouseText 
characters in AppleWorks word processor documents, one can design documents 
to look more attractive than was previously possible.  Serreau and Katz 
have done so here.  They're obviously assuming that readers will read the 
Gazette onscreen, and not want to print them out.

     The newsletter was cut shorter than the editors meant in this first 
issue, as there was a need to include certain tools on the first issue.  I 
look forward to the editors having more room to move next time out!


ON THE DISK   The software on the first issue actually has a slightly
"""""""""""   sparse feel, due to the necessity to supply the AppleWorks 
5.1 update on the first issue.  (The editors not only believe it is the 
reader's duty to keep up to date, but it is the Gazette's duty to help the 
reader stay current!)  The 5.1 update consumes also 40% of the disk space.  
Presumably later issues, freed from this restriction, will be meatier.

     The software contents break down as follows:

     1.  The official AppleWorks 5.1 update
     2.  Macros from Roy Barrows
     3.  DupeFinder, the macro reviewed in the newsletter
     4.  An unofficial upgrade for TimeOut DirecTree
     5.  19 new dot-commands for UltraMacros programmers
     6.  ShrinkIt 3.4 (necessary to unpack the software)

     The 5.1 update and ShrinkIt are unexciting, but the editors were 
duty-bound to include them.  DupeFinder, reviewed in the newsletter, is 
hardly an exclusive either, but it's well worth a look.  Don't confuse it 
with DuplicateFinder, included with AppleWorks 5.x--Joe Walters' DupeFinder 
is more flexible and useful.

     The macro and macro-writing tools--about 25 of 'em--from Roy Barrows 
are useful, but not polished.  I get the impression that they're more 
geared toward to AppleWorks programmer than the AppleWorks user.  Still, 
there are some gems here that you'll clasp to your bosom, even if you never 
program.

     The upgrade for TimeOut DirecTree is exciting, since it expands on 
the capabilities of DirecTree--with this patch, DirecTree lists text files 
as being AppleWorks compatible, and can load them.  You'll need to own 
DirecTree (available as part of TimeOut DeskTools IV) in order to apply the 
patches.

     Even more exciting are the 19 dot commands:  .Accent, .ChngChar, 
.FillBlock, .FillStrng, .FindChar, .FlipChar, .FlipStrng, .SC, .SCPrompt, 
.Sub, .Super, .StoreChar, .TabFill, .ZapCR, .GetLine, .PutLine, .Write, 
.PickStrng, and .PutStrng.  (These have also appeared on Texas II.)  The 
commands are all intended for use in the word processor, and make life 
easier for the UltraMacros programmer who wants to manipulate word 
processor files.


DATA   Also on the Gazette disk is the complete text--in AppleWorks word
""""   processor format, natch--of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes 
novel, _The Sign of Four_.  (Conan Doyle's copyright has lapsed, and this 
work is now in the public domain.)  Each of the 12 chapters is in its own 
word processor file.  The file have all been compacted with ShrinkIt.

     Personally, I found the inclusion of this item a little odd--your 
mileage may vary.  I like Sherlock Holmes stories, but I don't like reading 
books with my computer.  I'm all for having certain books on disk so that I 
can use the computer to search them, but not Conan Doyle's work.  Getting 
an entire book on a disk is a nice little treat, but somehow it feels out 
of place to me on an AppleWorks disk--almost like filler.  Perhaps if it 
hadn't happened on a month when the editors were cutting back their 
newsletter--?  I'm always more interested in original material than 
reprints.

     I'd like to underline that this is a personal, subjective reaction.  
It left me cold, but you may be delighted to with the lagniappe.  It's 
certainly an excellent book!


SUMMARY   There's room for improvement here, but the glitches are all
"""""""   minor.  The supplied browser provided no way of quitting, and 
have any labels in the macro menu.  Once or twice the formatting goes 
slightly awry, and since English is not his _langue de preference_, Serreau 
should consider asking Katz to edit his pieces for an English-speaking 
audience.

     The editors have had the good sense not to use ShrinkIt to compress 
the newsletter itself.  Presumably owners of TimeOut ShrinkIt will get the 
most out of the Gazette, since they can unpack the software and data 
without leaving AppleWorks.  (I predict the Gazette will help sell copies 
of TimeOut ShrinkIt, in fact.)

     The AppleWorks Gazette will be published bi-monthly, six times a 
year, and costs $35 for a one-year, six-issue subscription.  You should 
subscribe from the editor nearest you:

           Christian Serreau            Howard Katz
           12, rue de la Censerie       1104 Lorlyn Circle #2D
           49100 Angers                 Batavia, IL  60510
           France                       U.S.A.

           100316.14@compuserve.com     h.katz@genie.com

     At approximately $5.80 a disk, the Gazette seems to me a fair enough 
deal as it is.  If subsequent issues give more space to original material, 
then Serreau and Katz will have a winner here.

Top 10 Files for January
""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     This feature lists the ten most popular files for the month.  To give 
files a chance to seek their own levels, no files will be added to the list 
until they've been in place at least a month.  This month, we look at the 
files uploaded 1-31 January 1996.

     This isn't the Academy Awards ceremony, folks; it's more like the 
People's Choice Awards (both of which are trademarked, by the way).  The 
Top 10 doesn't necessarily tell you what's new and interesting--what files 
_you_ might find interesting--it simply tells you what files have been 
downloaded a lot--what other people found interesting!

A2.DOM.9601.BXY   The A2 RoundTable Disk of the Month continues to be a 
"""""""""""""""   favorite download.  It contains two newsletters-- 
GEnieLamp A2 and one edition of the weekly II Something--plus a collection 
of simple but entertaining BASIC games from Charlie Hartley.  For IIgs 
users, there are a set of SHR calendars for 1996, Jawaid Bazyar's HFS 
Patch, which fixes a bug in the HFS.FST partition, so that you can use 
Macintosh partitions and disks without fear, the prototype edition of Max 
Jones' Juiced.GS (requires AppleWorks GS), John Wrenholt's Print 3200 and 
an index of ShareWare Solutions II in a New Desk Accessory.

ROM4SHR.BXY   This collection of 14 SuperHiRes graphics of the fabled ROM 4 
"""""""""""   IIgs were taken by Joe Walters at a Apple user's group 
meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 6 January 1996.  See Jim Pittman and 
Byte Works' Mike Westerfield puzzle over the intricacies of this 
thought-to-be-legendary machine, code-named "Mark Twain".

ROM4PICS.TXT   This text file explains just what the heck is going on not 
""""""""""""   only in the 14 SHR graphics in ROM4SHR.BXY (above), but 
three hi-resolution GIF files too (TWAINHR1.GIF, TWAINHR2.GIF, and 
TWAINHR3.GIF).  The GIF files are available for download separately in the 
A2 RoundTable library.

DESKPLAY201.BXY   DeskPlay is really two programs in one, designed to play 
"""""""""""""""   MOD sound/music files.  The archive contains ShellPlay by 
Brian C. Bening, which allows MODs to be play from a shell environment such 
as GNO/ME.  For those intimidated by shells, or who just like New Desk 
Accessories, Ninjaforce had written DeskPlay, which interfaces seamlessly 
with ShellPlay.  Install both utilities and you'll be able to play MODs as 
you work on the IIgs desktop.  DeskPlay has a very attractive interface--if 
you can operate a CD player, you'll love it--but ShellPlay crashes when you 
try to run 8-bit applications.

DOS33.LNCHR.BXY   This program lets you install DOS 3.3 programs--or entire 
"""""""""""""""   disks--on your ProDOS hard disk or on 3.5-inch disks.  
You can then launch these DOS 3.3 programs via your favourite program 
launcher.  This unofficial release (v2.1) supposedly supports networks.  
Daniel Pfarrer assembled this version from the remains of the source code 
on programmer John MacLean's hard disk.

TWAINHR3.GIF   This high-resolution (1520x756x256) GIF format graphic shows 
""""""""""""   an overhead view of the motherboard of the "Mark Twain" ROM 
4 IIgs.  Visible are two SIMM slots, the battery, the sound transducer, the 
five slots, and various other details.  This is GIF89a format graphic, and 
some GIF viewers may not be able to handle it.  ShowMe! is one program that 
definitely can handle it.

GS.PLUS.ADB.BXY   An AppleWorks 3.0 database file of the programs that 
"""""""""""""""   appeared in _GS+ Magazine_ over the years.  Handy--since 
back issues are still available from EGO Systems!--for exploring what 
programs are available and for checking that you have the most recent 
version.  This file lists the first appearance of a program, the last 
appearance, and the current version number.  

CALENDAR96.BXY   A 1996 calendar in AppleWorks GS format, from Max Jones.  
""""""""""""""   Customizable.  Includes bitmap and TrueType versions of 
the New York font.  (Sorry, folks--this description is brief because I 
don't own AppleWorks GS and therefore can't examine the file.)

GLAMPA29602.BXY   The February 1996 issue of GEnieLamp A2, the only 
"""""""""""""""   remaining monthly Apple II publication.  Highlights of 
this issue include a profile of Max Jones, publisher of _Juiced.GS_, three 
different views on the educational game "Where In Hell Is Carmen 
Santiago?", and Jay Curtis' look at the speed of Deja II (AppleWorks 5 on 
the Mac).  If you're a regular reader of GEnieLamp A2, you won't be 
surprised to learn that it's one of the top 10 download, but you might be 
surprised to find the February issue listed as a top download for January!  
The explanation is simple:  GEnieLamp A2 is usually uploaded on the last 
day of the previous month.

AW1040.95.BXY   An Appleworks 3.0 spreadsheet template of form 1040 to do 
"""""""""""""   your 1995 U.S. income tax.  Selects tax tables or tax 
schedule as appropriate.  Uses lower alternative capital gains rate if 
applicable.  Calculates limitations on exemptions and deductions for high 
income people.  Does form 2210 penalty and alternative minimum tax if 
applicable.  From Maxwell Campbell.

     Did you know that Genie's A2 RoundTable takes an archival approach?  
The library doesn't just contain the favorite files nor the recent ones, 
the way sound services do--it prides itself on its archival library.  The 
same is true of the A2 Bulletin Board--the messages don't just scroll off 
into the ether, like on other Computer Services; they are archived and kept 
in the file library.

                             """""""""""""""""
           ~ Steve Cavanaugh, publisher of _The Apple Blossom_ ~

     Steve Cavanaugh had been providing his newsletter _The Apple 
Blossom_, absolutely free, to anyone who cared to download it and print a 
copy.  It was well received right from the start, and "subscribers" began 
to tell Steve that he should be charging for such a quality publication.  
That's the kind of advice you'd be foolish to ignore, so Steve Cavanaugh 
took it.  The first subscription issue of _The Apple Blossom_ was posted 
just before GenieLamp A2 went to press.  We managed to buttonhole the 
exhausted publisher/editor for this month's profile....

                                 [*][*][*]


GenieLamp>   Are computers a part of your daytime job?  Please tell us a
"""""""""    little about what you do between 9 and 5.

Steve>   Computers _are_ my daytime job.  Since last June I've been working
"""""    for Mosby-Year Book, a medical publisher.  I use a PowerMac to 
layout books in Quark XPress, doing manuscript corrections and coding in 
ClarisWorks and occasionally WordPerfect Mac.  I also have the unofficial 
position of office geek, and all the questions about PCs or Macs usually 
come to me.  For the three years before that I was a computer teacher in an 
elementary parochial school.


GenieLamp>   How and why did you begin _The Apple Blossom_ as a free
"""""""""    electronically-distributed but paper-based publication?

Steve>   When I was teaching I used to host a monthly get-together for the
"""""    other computer teachers in the diocese to pass along shareware and 
system updates and to discuss teaching strategies and field how-to 
questions.  The newsletter was originally conceived as a way of sharing 
that info with teachers who couldn't make the meetings.  Then I decided to 
upload it to Genie in case anyone else was interested, and it kind of took 
on a life of its own from that point.


GenieLamp>   What problems arose with this method of distribution?
"""""""""    Did any of them influence your decision to go commercial?

Steve>   The only real problem was that some folks had trouble printing the
"""""    copies I uploaded.  That ended up being a real education about the 
differences in the way the page setup for a Harmonie-driven DeskJet and a 
LaserWriter do their work.  (However, as a side bonus, I learned how to get 
a DeskWriter 310 working with a IIgs, so I can occasionally print out some 
very nice graphics.)  It also pointed out how different versions of the 
same font can have very different effects.  Trying to make it as easy for 
other folks to print and get at led me to upload 4 different versions of 
the last [freeware] edition.


GenieLamp>   Please tell us about what your decision to go commercial
"""""""""    was based on, and how you arrived at it.

Steve>   Basically, the newsletter had gotten so popular that I couldn't
"""""    afford to do it out-of-pocket any longer.  I distribute it via AOL 
and my Web page, as well as on Genie and through mailings, and the total 
distribution had reached about 450.  The last issue cost me around $200, 
and I can't keep that kind of spending up.


GenieLamp>   How often will you publish?
"""""""""
Steve>   Last year I published 4 issues.  This year I plan on publishing 6
"""""    issues (every 2 months).  If a lot of people subscribe, to the 
point where it is feasible to have other people working on the newsletter 
part-time, then more frequent publication is possible.  But I don't foresee 
that for this year.


GenieLamp>   How much will a subscription be?
"""""""""
Steve>   $12 per year.  I plan on a subscription plan like Joe Kohn uses
"""""    for Shareware Solutions II.  If someone subscribes after two 
issues have already gone out, then I'll send the new subscriber the first 
two issues as well.  I think that was a great concept that Joe came up 
with.  And since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...


GenieLamp>   Would you tell us how you first became interested in the
"""""""""    Apple II?  Was it your first computer?

Steve>   Actually, no, the first computer we had was a TRS-80.  It was a
"""""    hand-me-down from my younger brother.  We got it so that my son, 
who was two years old at the time, could practice writing.  He knew his 
letters, but didn't have the hand coordination to write them out.  He took 
to the computer like he was born for it.  By the way, the first word he 
could spell was "RUN" (for BASIC).

     I was actually very hesitant to get a computer.  My one and only 
computer class in college was a dismal failure.  After 4 weeks of trying to 
get 4 lines to print out using a COBOL program I decided to drop the course 
and avoid computers.  I even quit one job in part because it was being 
computerized.

     However, when I went back to school to get my teaching credentials, 
word processing was required.  I started out on a Zenith PC, but once I 
learned how to use an Apple IIgs at a school I worked at, I decided that I 
preferred Apples to IBM clones.


GenieLamp>   At what point did you realize that your casual hobby (of
"""""""""    computing) had evolved into something more than a "casual 
hobby"?

Steve>   That would probably be when I started staying at school until
"""""    1 a.m. muttering about Autoexec.bat files and trying to make 
backups of copy protected software with Copy II Plus.


GenieLamp>   What do you see as the focus of _The Apple Blossom_?
"""""""""
Steve>   Last year it was mostly reviews and announcements.  This year I'd
"""""    like to shift the focus more to "how to" articles.  The HyperCard, 
AppleWorks and Cross-Platform departments will focus on that type of 
article.  But reviews (more in-depth, I'm planning) will continue, as will 
announcements.


GenieLamp>   What hardware and software are you using to produce the
"""""""""    newsletter?  How about the printer you intend to use to create 
the master?

Steve>   I write most of the articles in Hermes/ShadowWrite or in
"""""    Clarisworks on my PowerBook while I'm taking the train back and 
forth to work in Philadelphia.  I lay out the articles in GraphicWriter 
III, and use SuperConvert, Prism, Convert 3200 and DreamGraphix to work on 
graphics.  I purchased an Apple LaserWriter Select 360 last year and I use 
that to create the masters.


GenieLamp>   Is _The Apple Blossom_ going to be a one-man operation?
"""""""""
Steve>   For the time being.  I am printing articles written by other
"""""    folks, however.  I'm hoping to have someone else write articles on 
AppleWorks and telecommunications, as those aren't areas I can write about 
with a great deal of expertise.  But I plan on writing the articles on 
HyperCard, reviews, etc.  And of course, keeping records, doing promotions, 
"constructing" the Web site, etc.


GenieLamp>   Do you think the Apple II world is still large enough to
"""""""""    support competing magazines and newsletters?

Steve>   Well, the Apple II world probably has 20 million or more users if
"""""    you think of all the school kids using them.  There ought to be 
enough room for several newsletters.  One thing that I'm planning in the 
second edition this year is a two page insert aimed especially at kids.  
I'm hoping that that will eventually become a disk-based subscription, with 
art, templates, simple BASIC programs, tutorials and writing and artwork by 
kids.  My own three kids are pretty eager to help with this.


GenieLamp>   What do you consider your most proud accomplishment?
"""""""""
Steve>   Kind of a tricky question... sometimes I wonder if I've
"""""    accomplished anything....  The thing I'm most glad about is 
marrying the girl I did...  It took eight years to get my wife to agree to 
marry me, and I'm glad I didn't lose heart.


GenieLamp>   Who do you look up to as your mentors?
"""""""""
Steve>   In computers?  Well, I've been really inspired by Auri
"""""    Rahimzadeh's PowerGS--that was an excellent magazine, and I hope 
he gets to return to it.  In the wider realm, I used to think my Dad's 
emphasis on getting everything perfect was excessive--but as I get older 
I'm coming to appreciate the craftsmanship he was able to bring to things 
like carpentry, building fishing rods, etc.


GenieLamp>   Where do you see the future of telecommunications moving in
"""""""""    the next five to ten years?

Steve>   I'm afraid that it's heading toward distributed computing.  Sort
"""""    of like the dumb terminals that were used to connect to mainframes 
back in the late 60s and early 70s.  Of course, the programs will be a heck 
of a lot more interesting and colorful than the command lines of that time, 
but the control will be in network admin hands, not in the hands of the 
user.  I'm not very happy about this trend at all.  It's as though we have 
found that it's difficult to teach people how to use computers, and 
difficult to create software that doesn't require a college degree to 
operate, and we're just giving up and feeding the public pretty pictures 
and sounds, but taking the control away.  I hope that I'm wrong.


GenieLamp>   What sorts of things do you like to do for fun (i.e.
"""""""""    non-computer hobbies)?

Steve>   What do you mean, non-computer?  Is that a trick question? 
"""""    Seriously, I've been very focused on stack writing and writing 
_The Apple Blossom_ for the past 6 months.  However, for those few minutes 
per day when I'm not using a computer, I strum the guitar, bake bread or 
pizza, read sci-fi, or read with my kids.


GenieLamp>   How did you get involved in telecommunications?
"""""""""
Steve>   In Vermont, where I began teaching, we had a statewide BBS for the
"""""    schools called Winternet.  I used that and the Fidonet forums it 
carried to communicate with folks throughout the state and world.  I was 
hooked at once!


GenieLamp>   How long have you been a member of Genie?  What new
"""""""""    services do you think Genie should provide its subscribers?

Steve>   I joined GEnie in March 1993... but I found the interface so
"""""    daunting that I logged on very seldom.  There were a couple of 
months when I didn't even log a single call into GEnie.  It wasn't until 
America Online gave Apple II users the boot and folks started talking about 
the great Apple II forums on GEnie that I really gave it a good try.  Now I 
log on every day.  As far as new services, I'm somewhat concerned about the 
new directions that Genie is taking under its new ownership.  However, I 
can see the value of having a faster connection that can be accessed from 
anywhere in the country, via Genie.  I just hope that the jump in price 
doesn't cause too many people to leave.


GenieLamp>   What one piece of advice would you pass along to a new
"""""""""    Apple II telecommunications enthusiast?

Steve>   ...Visit my website?
"""""
     Really, though, the best advice for anyone just beginning to use a 
modem is to get the advice of someone with experience.  I found 
telecommunications software pretty difficult to understand when I first 
started out, having a non-technical background.  Being able to ask 
questions of folks who knew more was the best thing to help me out.
