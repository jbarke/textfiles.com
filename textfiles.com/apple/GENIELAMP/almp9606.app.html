Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     A few months ago, I was stolen from.  Sadly, I've been through this 
before.  What bothered me this time was that the perpetrator was from our 
own community.  A significant portion of an article I had written for an 
Apple II magazine turned up on someone's web page.  I wrote the owner of 
the web page, informing him that he was infringing my copyright, and asking 
that he cease.

     Did I get an apology and prompt action?  No, I did not.  I got an 
argument, a request for permission, and an attempt at a guilt trip.  As the 
saying goes, some people would not hesitate to drive up to the gates of 
Heaven and honk.

     This person's argument was he had only copied part of my article.  
This, he said, came under the "fair use" provision.  Many people do not 
understand the fair use clause.  It was meant to make life easier for 
academics--to permit them to quote authorities in their original work--not 
to make life easier for those who do not understand the concept of 
intellectual property.

     (I am not trying to shame anyone.  If you don't understand copyright 
or intellectual property, you need not hang your head.  What you should do 
is learn about it.  You could begin teaching yourself about copyright by 
reading Brad Templeton's document, "10 Big Myths about copyright explained" 
[http://www.clari.net/brad/copymyths.html].  You can also get quite a good 
layman's overview of copyright from _The Chicago Manual of Style_.  This 
classic work stresses that quotations must not be so long that they 
represent a significant portion of the original work: "to quote five 
hundred words from an essay of five thousand is bound to be more serious 
than to quote the same number of words from a work of fifty thousand".  
[13th ed., p. 123])

     Only after the person who had violated my copyright had argued with 
me, presumably in an attempt to cow me, did he ask permission to use my 
material.  Even then he wasn't done.  He implied that I owed him permission 
because I had uploaded his freeware to Genie.  (In fact, I had not.  But if 
I had, how is that relevant?  His material was freeware.  Mine is not.)

     I consider myself pretty easy to get along with, but I could not find 
it in my heart to grant permission to anyone while they were actually in 
the act of violating my copyright.  I asked the miscreant to remove the 
material while I decided.  He complied.  Still no apology.  (Don't hold 
your breath waiting for one... he still has not apologized.)

     What followed?  He removed one piece of my copyright material from 
his web page, and substituted another!  The next time I visited his page, 
my E-mail to him about copyright violation was there.  Not everyone 
realizes that private correspondence is also copyright material, and cannot 
be reproduced without permission.  So I didn't go ballistic.  I wrote 
granting permission for him to use the original excerpt if he attributed it 
correctly and affixed a copyright notice.  I also pointed out that he 
really should ask permission before reproducing E-mail.

     He thanked me, and affixed a copyright notice.  We are not talking 
about an evil person here... merely a discourteous and uninformed one.  I 
hope.  But I confess that if someone told me that I had done something 
wrong without meaning to, I would try to make amends.  In my case, this 
hasn't happened.

     Uninformed people don't worry me.  Ignorant people do.  (They're easy 
to spot... they insist on remaining uninformed.)

     With the popularity of web pages, everyone is now his or her own 
publisher.  The problem is, most people want the power without the 
responsibility.  Heck, they don't even know that as a publisher, one HAS 
responsibilities.  Desktop publishing is actually a serious misnomer.  A 
layout program doesn't teach you how to publish.

     Only the ADVANCED "publishers" realize that you must correctly 
attribute copyright material... but they think that their job ends there.  
It doesn't.  After attribution, you still have to get permission.  If you 
make your own copy of my copyright material, it's NOT enough to tell 
everyone that I own it.  Too many people think permission isn't necessary 
if the work is attributed.  This is false.

     I'm familiar with Stewart's Law of Retraction:  "It is easier to get 
forgiveness than permission."  The thing is, folks, these "laws", like 
Murphy's Law, were meant to be laughed at, not followed.  Stewart's Law of 
Retraction is laughing at people who order their lives this way.  Since the 
desktop publishing revolution began, the joke isn't as funny.  Desktop 
publishers actually obey Stewart's Law.  The mind boggles.

     Or maybe it's just my mind that's boggling.  But then, my mind is the 
kind that has never understood litterbugs.  I cannot for one moment 
conceive that my immediate convenience is more important that litter-free 
neighborhoods.  So I carry the sticky ice cream wrapper for ten blocks.  
Others think that the world revolves not merely around their needs--that 
was bad enough--but around their CONVENIENCE.  Too many desktop publishers 
and too many web pagers seem to think that their instant gratification is 
embodied in the constitution.

     I'm not a law'n'order kind of guy, but I have to tell you that I am 
annoyed by what happened to me.  When I stood up for my rights, I got an 
argument.  When I was easy to get along with, I let a thief walk away with 
the perception that he had done nothing wrong.  And this happened right 
here in the Apple II community.  That's discouraging.

     My great regret is that I cannot afford to attend KansasFest this 
year.  KFest would take this bad taste out of my mouth in the first two 
minutes.  At KansasFest, you get a chance to be reminded that the Apple II 
community really is a community.  You may arrive feeling like a nobody, but 
you'll go home feeling like one of the family.  I urge you to attend if you 
possibly can.

YOUR GUIDE TO TESTING SCSI TERMINATION   A short note on testing SCSI 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   termination resistor arrays (in 
particular, the resistor arrays used for internal termination)

     When 'Gremlins' invade ones SCSI setup, and all the usual means have 
been exhausted in trying to get rid of them without success, it is quite 
possible that a terminator resistor has failed.  Without proper termination 
a SCSI chain simply will not work properly and reliably.  (Symptoms may 
range from random crashes and lockups to total corruption of files on any 
or all devices on the SCSI chain)

     The typical resistor array used for terminating a SCSI chain is a 
Single Inline Package (SIP) device, with eight pins.  These consist 
(internally) of an array of resistors as follows:

1    220 ohm     2    330 ohm     8 (10)
|----v^v^v^v^----|----v^v^v^v^----|
|                                 |
|                3                |
|----v^v^v^v^----|----v^v^v^v^----|
|                                 |
|                4                |
|----v^v^v^v^----|----v^v^v^v^----|
|                                 |
|                5                |
|----v^v^v^v^----|----v^v^v^v^----|
|                                 |
|                6                |
|----v^v^v^v^----|----v^v^v^v^----|
|                                 |
|                7                |
|----v^v^v^v^----|----v^v^v^v^----|
|                                 |
|               (8)               |  <- these two apply only to 10 pin
|----v^v^v^v^----|----v^v^v^v^----|     termination arrays
|                                 |
|               (9)               |
|----v^v^v^v^----|----v^v^v^v^----|

     [Note: The numbers above that are in parenthesis apply only to 10 pin 
termination resistor arrays (some drives (and the RamFast) use two of 
these, instead of three of the eight pin arrays)]

     Note:  Pin 1 on all these devices is noted in some manner on the 
device itself.  Usually it will have a small dot next to it, or there will 
be a notch in the body of the device adjacent to pin #1

     At first it may appear that an ohm meter can be used to test these 
arrays, but upon closer inspection it should become apparent that there is 
no way to isolate either end of any one resistor... which means that one is 
faced with a complex array. Not conducive to ohm meter testing at all.

     There is however an easy way to test these.  Apply +5 to pin #8 and 
ground pin #1.  Now measure the voltage developed between ground and pins 
2-6, as well as the voltage between +5 and pins 2-6.

     If any pin (2-6 or 2-9 for 10 pin devices) reads almost a full five 
volts vs ground, then that terminator array is bad (one of the 330 ohm 
resistors is open, or one of the 220 ohm resistors is shorted)

     If any pin (2-6 or 2-9 for 10 pin devices) reads almost zero volts vs 
+5, then that terminator array is bad (one of the 220 ohm resistors is 
open, or one of the 330 ohm resistors is shorted)

     (The exact voltage isn't that critical, what is critical is that all 
the measurements are very close to one another.  With the typical resistor 
array, there will be less than 1% variance, as these arrays are made using 
thick film technology, and all the resistors of each value are made at the 
same time)

"MY IIGS IS NOW CALLER ID EQUIPPED"   > Is Art Coughlin still out there?

     Yup.....waaaay out there. :)    Present and almost accounted for.

     > Is there a simple step by step process one should follow?

     I believe there is an X-10 FAQ in the A2 lib (uploaded courtesy of 
Goose).

     If you have access to back issues of II Alive, there was a fairly 
lucid article on X-10 in the May-June '94 issue.

     While I'm here, I'd like to announce that my IIgs is now Caller ID 
equipped :)

     A couple of years ago, I picked up a Caller ID decoder board that was 
meant to be plugged into the serial port on a WinTel machine.  Since Caller 
ID went nation-wide this year, I decided to subscribe and dug the board out 
of the closet.  A little tinkering with my home control program and it's 
working.

PERILS OF BASIC IN A CDA   I couldn't find a better place to put this, so 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   here it is :)

     BUG ALERT!!!

     If you have Dave Lyon's 'BasicCDA' (also known as the 'Visit 
Applesoft' CDA) and use it, you should reboot right after each use of it.

     In the course of an unrelated (well, only distantly related) 
programming project, I had cause to disassemble Dave's CDA... Part of it's 
setup (and exit) routines deal with saving (restoring) several sets of 
vectors from page three.  Unfortunetly there is a bit of a bug in the code 
that saves these vectors, such that several of them get overwritten.  When 
these corrupted vectors are restored the machine is in a delicate state, 
and a crash, lockup, or other undesirable action is eventually inevitable.

     (Greg T, Sheppy - Should either of you wish to verify my findings, 
let me know, and I'll email you the related files (all pseudo source is in 
Merlin format) Dave messed up and used the wrong label for one of the save 
loops, this causes the data saved to be placed in the same area that some 
previously saved data was occupying.  The restore loops are fine, which 
means the wrong data gets restored to some of the vectors)

     If anyone has a current email address for Dave Lyons, I'd appreciate 
it being either posted or emailed to me.  (I wish to secure his permision 
to correct the problem and re-release his CDA in a fixed version)

     Well, it seems that only a few days are left over for me until I have 
to leave GEnie (Genie).  The number of our products, the support we gave 
(and would further give) to the Apple II community, and the products we are 
still planning to develop and to release, all these things seem to be not 
enough for the Genie admins that they give _us_ enough support that we 
would be able to continue our support here in the A2 Bulletin Board.  Since 
there is a new pricing scheme for all users of Genie, the costs for 
overseas users drastically will go up to a level that is not affordable 
anymore.

     So we have no choice other than leaving Genie or paying _much_ money 
for being present on Genie in the future.  However, the low level of Apple

WHITE ON BLACK IN GRAPHICWRITER III   I just printed white text in a black 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   box from GW III :)  Here's what I 
did.  First, I created a text frame and typed in some text in Avant Garde, 
at 18 points, and then set the style to bold and outline.  I then selected 
the text, and set the Pen color to white.  Next I selected the text frame 
with the arrow tool, and set the Fill color to black.  Then I printed, to 
an Appletalk Laserwriter using Apple's printer driver.  It came out a nice 
black box with the white text in it.  Note:  the screen presentation did 
not show me white text on a black box.  It showed me a black box; but when 
scrolling up or down I could see the text kind of jumping in behind, so I 
knew it was still there.  I also tried this with a grey and yellow fill, 
and it worked fine, except the fill was then more of a pattern.  Hope this 
works for you.  Oh, one more thing.  I did not check the screen 
presentation in "Actual Size" only in "Tall Text"...perhaps "Actual Size" 
shows the box and text correctly...too late to check tonight though!  Ciao!

"""""
     Early today (Monday), I drove 2 1/2 hours from my home in Sullivan, 
Indiana, to Champaign, Illinois, where I spent almost fours hours with 
Derek Taubert, author of GS/TCP, the software that will team up with GNO/ME 
2.0.6 to allow IIGS users to connect directly to the Internet via SLIP, 
PPP, etc.

     Derek is an =extremely= interesting young man with great knowledge of 
the inner workings of the IIGS and some great ideas for future 
telecommunications products.  The only thing standing in the way of his 
moving forward right now is his Master's thesis, which he must complete by 
late July, when he is scheduled to move to San Jose, California, and begin 
a job with Cisco Systems, which specializes these days in Internet routers.

     When his thesis is complete and he gets settled into the Silicon 
Valley, he says he will then begin pulling together the final pieces of 
GS/TCP and make a decision on how the product will be packaged and sold.  
(He is also the programmer who is developing GNO/ME 2.0.6, which GS/TCP 
requires.)

     Derek suspects it will be August before he can again turn his full 
attention to the project.  The software development is essentially 
complete.  What remains to be done is documentation and preparations for 
distribution.

     It was a thrill to see GS/TCP in action.  Among other exercises in 
'Net surfing, we FTPed into Cal Tech and downloaded a small file directly 
to his hard drive.

     And to top it all off, he fired up GS Web, his graphical web browser 
that is in early development.  Much work remains to do in the web browser, 
but we moved around the Web, stopping at familiar sites such as the GS/TCP 
web page, the Shareware Solutions II home page, the Cal Tech A2 page, and 
we even dropped in on the comp.sys.apple2 Usenet newsgroup.

     It was awesome.  The words "You can't do that on an Apple 2" kept 
running through my mind.  I had to smile. :)

     Hope no one minds this long post.  I just thought I'd share a little 
of what I learned with the folks here in A2.  Meanwhile, I have about two 
hours of tape to transcribe from my interview, and then I will begin 
writing an article about Derek, his work, and what it means to the Apple 
IIGS community.

     Oh, by the way, work on the spring edition of Juiced.GS is well under 
way.  It is scheduled to be published late this month.

     Anyone care to hazard a guess what the cover story will be?  :-)

>>>>>   Glad to hear folks are eager to hear more about Derek Taubert's
"""""   development of GS/TCP.

     One of the most interesting things to me is the great potential 
GS/TCP holds for sparking development of new software for the IIGS.  Once 
GS/TCP is on the market, independent developers can then produce 
complementary products such as a graphical Internet relay chat application, 
a full-featured news reader, graphical telnet, mail reader, and, of course, 
a web browser.  In fact, Derek tells me some of his testers =are= working 
on some of these products.

     During the GS/TCP demonstration, Derek fired up a new application by 
James Brooks of Procyon fame that is in the final phase of development.  
It's known as GS Mail (an old news release about it appeared on the last 
issue of Softdisk GS).  The pre-release version I saw in action, however, 
went by the name of "Metaphor" and is a slick piece of work.  Nice 
interface, cool icons, and apparently loads of mail-reading and handling 
features.  Derek explained that that's the sort of program that could work 
well with GS/TCP.

     Derek said GS Mail is not yet ready for distribution, but there's not 
a lot of work remaining.  He doesn't know when James plans to finish, but 
Derek intends to encourage completion so it will be ready when GS/TCP hits 
the market.

"""""   that he is aware that Apple II users continue to dwindle, but he

reason he feels no pressure is because he's not doing this for the money.  
In fact, he said he expects to make very little money, certainly nothing 
near worth the time and effort he put into it.  His motivation seems to 
come from inner forces, not market forces.

     I'll share one quote from Derek on this subject.  He says he is 
developing something that is "purely a work of art rather than something 
that is just a commercial product."

     For myself, I also wish we could have this product right now.  
Unfortunately, however, it's going to be a while.  Having seen GS/TCP, GS

APPLEWORKS GS TRANSLATOR FOR GRAPHICWRITER III!   May 8, 1996 -- EGO 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Systems is pleased to 
announce the upcoming release of a new AppleWorks GS Translator module for 
Seven Hills Software's GraphicWriter III page layout program.

     Over the years, AppleWorks GS (AWGS) has become a "de-facto" standard 
for word processing on the Apple IIGS.  Unfortunately, while the AWGS word 
processor is quite usable, it's page layout capabilities leave a lot to be 
desired.  That's where the AWGS Translator for GraphicWriter III comes in.

     The AWGS Translator for GraphicWriter III allows you to take 
AppleWorks GS word processor files and import them into your GraphicWriter 
III page layouts with all of the font, size, and style (and more!) 
information intact!  You can then use GraphicWriter III's superior 
page-layout tools to give your text those extra-special touches.

     When you import an AppleWorks GS file into GraphicWriter III, here's 
what the translator pulls out of the file for you:

 -*- Font Information:  Typeface (Times, Helvetica, etc), size (10 point, 
24 point, etc.) and style (bold, superscript, etc.) information is all 
preserved!

 -*- Text Colors:  Colored text in your AppleWorks GS file is automatically 
given the correct color in GraphicWriter III!

 -*- Paragraph Justification:  Was that paragraph originally centered?  Or 
was it right justified?  No need to guess, the AWGS Translator figures it 
out for you!

 -*- Paragraph Indentation:  Each paragraph's indentation is recreated in

TIMEOUT DATABASE DISKSEARCH   Some here might be interested to learn about 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   a new TimeOut accessory written by Randy 
Brandt.  TO.DB DiskSearch searches a data base ON DISK for an exact match 
of criteria that you enter.  It is available exclusively from TEXAS II (see 
below).

     The search is very fast, and would be used to search a large data 
base without taking the time to load it to the desktop first.  It returns 
the contents of all categories, up to 80 characters onscreen.  The 
remaining data can be seen in Debug (OA-Ctrl-X) in variables $20 to $79.  
Thus, the contents of the entire record are available for use within custom 
macros.

     The search data can be entered in upper or lower case, but it must 
match a complete category string; for example, Brandt not Brand or Bran.

     TimeOut DB DiskSearch can be found in the /FRIENDS directory of TEXAS 
II on Disk vol.20, along with a custom macro for its use.  Questions about 
the availability, use and performance of TimeOut DBDisk Search and 
accompanying macros should be addressed _only_ to the TEXAS II Mail Group 
at 75757.3722@compuserve.com.

     TEXAS II also offers an update for TimeOut File Search (found on the 
DeskTools IV disk from Scantron Quality Computers).  File Search will 
perform partial matches, and also searches WP and SS files.

APPLE II LAPTOP (SORT OF)   I tried the Tiger Learning Computer briefly at 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""   the Electronic Entertainment Expo last week in 
Los Angeles.  It looks almost identical on-screen to a regular IIe.  There 
are .SYSTEM files launched from ProDOS, and Applesoft programs seem to run 
as always.  ("I'm just fooling around." "I wish you wouldn't." - my 
encounter with a Tiger product rep :)

     It looks like a laptop, but where the screen would be is where up to 
six cartridge-based softwares are installed.  The keyboard's buttons are 
very flat, and have very little "clickability."  The layout has changed, as 
well.  There seemed to be Internet support, but whether it was disabled for 
the show or permanently, I couldn't tell.

     Read more about it in Volume 2 Issue 2 of The Apple Blossom.

ADDRESSED FOR SUCCESS AND BULK MAIL   Well, I just got back from the local 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Post Office where I attended a "Mail 
Classification Reform" training class.  The upshot of this  meeting was 
that bulk mailing procedures are about to change  DRAMATICALLY.  These 
changes will probably make Addressed For  Success' Bulk Sortation and bar 
code options, um, obsolete.

     I'm going to look into what needs to be done to update AFS to  
conform with the new standards, but I'd like to know how much of an update 
you guys are willing to pay for.

     At this point, I don't know EXACTLY what's going to be required to 
bring AFS in line with the new standards, so I can't really  give any 
specifics.  I do know however that It WON'T be a small amount of work.  
We're talking a v2.0 or even 3.0 level revision here.  If these revisions 
happen, it'll not only be an expensive  update, the base cost of the 
product will go up too (well, probably).

     So, how much is too much?  Does ANYBODY use the bulk mail or bar 
codes?  Should I just rip em out, CUT the price and just position it as an 
Address manager and label printer?

Message 111       Mon May 27, 1996
GARY.UTTER [Dispatcher]      at 14:46 EDT
 
     When viewing GIFs on either a IIc or a IIe it is well to bear in mind 
that neithier computer was designed with any intention of being able to 
HANDLE graphics at this level.  These computers were designed to work in 
text, and deal with the very SIMPLE graphics of the time.

     NO personal computer of the same design generation as the IIe and IIc 
is capable of doing a better job wihtout significant modifications 
(including running later generation software, hardware and monitors).

     The IIc is nothing more than a slightly modified IIe, and the IIe is 
nothing more than a slightly updated II+, which, in turn is a slightly 
updated II.

     The technology, in other words is approximately 15 years old.  The 
initial designe was a very GOOD design and required relatively minor 
updates to produce a computer that is STILL highly usable in this day and 
age.  But attempting to view these high quality graphics on such a machine 
should be considered an interesting experiment in how far the basic design 
can be pushed rather than something that SHOULD be doable as well on a IIc 
as on a IIgs.

     The IIgs itself, much as I love it, requires SERIOUS hardware 
"intervention" in order to display these graphics as well as more current 
platforms can do.

     The Ford Model T was an incredible vehicle for its time, and has 
capabilities that modern vehicles, for the most part, simply cannot 
emulate.  The Model T can handle "off road" conditions that would require a 
"full tilt" off road 4WD vehicle today (this WITHOUT 4WD, or even fat 
tires), and can be maintained and repaired with simple hand tools (and 
perhaps a bit of bailing wire).  It will run on fuel that a modern vehicle 
will choke and die on.

     The Model T was a simple, elegant and extremely effective machine for 
the purpose for which it was designed.  While I would not want to 
characterize the IIe and IIc as "Model T" computers (they are much more 
than that), there ARE some strong paralells.  The II series (even the GS) 
are simple and elegant machines that can perform the tasks they were 
designed for (IMO) much better than more modern machines can perform those 
same tasks.  But there are limits to the performance levels they can 
acheive.

     This is not to say that you shouldn't attempt to display GIFs on a 
IIc, by any means, but (like the dancing bear) the marvel is not how WELL 
it can be done, but that it can be done at ALL.

     This whole message may be inappropriate for this topic, and meat for 
a different sort of discussion. :)

Free Disks, Just By Not Signing Up!

                       >>> FREE DISKS = BIG $$$$ <<<
                       """""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Just recently, I had been following a thread of tongue in cheek 
comments made on Genie A2 concening the plethora of free disks being mailed 
by Americal Oline (AOL).  The thread concerned junk mail as finally having 
some value--a reformattable floppy disk.  While musing these comments, I 
happened on an article illuminating the results of this advertising scheme.

According to an Associated Press article in the Phoenix Republic newspaper 
Monday 5/13/96:

   "AOL's 1 million subscribers in 1995 increased to 5 million in 1996."

     While AOL may be the world's largest free disk supplier, with their 
present level of 5 million customers, they also now claim title to the 
world's largest subscriber service.  They, along with the other "free disk 
supplier," CompuServe who with 2 million subscribers in 1995 and twice as 
big as AOL, is now second to AOL with their 1996 level of 4 million 
subscribers.  Neither service seem to be worried that a few of their disks 
are used to level tables or are erased for personal use, and were last 
reported as being seen in private boothes at the bank where they sip caf`e 
au lait and watch large forklifts stack their money.

     Meanwhile, Prodigy, who AOL management helped to get online in the 
late '80s and early '90's, was sold to its most present management, 
allowing IBM and Sears to stop pouring large sums of money into a poorly 
managed "black hole."  IBM and Sears have been seeking relief from the 
giant sucking sound that Prodigy was making as it dined on their cash 
reserves.

     GEnie, who has sent out a least one free (IBM) based disk with a 
really ugly label (I have that disk ;-), and Delphi, who's management not 
only does not send out free disks, they never return phone calls nor reply 
to email requests, did not even receive honorable mention in the Associated 
Press report.

     eWorld, another free disk supplier, (we all have lots of those disks 
too :-), was digested and flushed, and reportedly last seen passing through 
a treatment plant somewhere in California.  Its interesting to note, that 
like Prodigy, eWorld was also assisted by AOL as it emerged as Apple 
Computer's disastrous attempt to do battle for the higly competitive 
subscriber service.

FROM THE AUTHOR   SOUNDS OF HISTORY... consists of people and events in
"""""""""""""""   history.  Most everyone can read about a certain person 
or event that is mentioned in this stack.  Why not hear what they sounded 
like or hear the event as it actually happened?  All of these events 
occurred before the age of television.  So what was the mode of 
communication?  Phonographs and radio, live radio in fact....

     Some technical notes.  My school recently purchased a Quickie hand 
scanner with which I am most impressed with.  All of the graphics except 
the HyperStudio "logo" were scanned with it.  Having this scanner allows 
great leeway in developing stacks when for instance, a photograph would fit 
the bill.  As with most things, you can always scan it just a little better 
if I did it one more time, but I had to draw the line somewhere.  I might 
also note that pictures of some of the people in this stack were hard, if 
not impossible to get from my resources.  I had to make do with what I 
could find.  The sound files came from some old records of famous events in 
history I have.  Keep in mind that these are live radio recordings as the 
quality made leave a lot to be desired.  Also, I have an old amp and some 
speakers hooked up to my GS so I have to make allowances on the volume of 
the sound files.  Hopefully, I didn't record the sound files at too low a 
volume.  

     This idea for this stack should sound similar to some old Edward R. 
Murrow records called "Hear it Now".  It is based on the same idea.  All of 
the pictures were scanned from various magazines and books.

PD_Q COMMENTS   A week is a long time in politics, as Sir Harold Wilson
"""""""""""""   once said.  Similarly, a second is a long time when it 
comes to sound files.  Each second of sound can take up to 10,000 bytes on 
disk, which means close to a minute of downloading time at 2400 baud.  Even 
at 9600 baud, to download the complete soundtrack of your average feature 
film would take over a day.

     The relevance of the above statistical trivia is that all three of 
Joel Helton's "Sound of History" stacks rely heavily on sound.  The stacks 
range in size between 350 and 500K.  The first stack has about 50 seconds 
of sound, the second about 48, and the third stack about 27 seconds.

     Each stack has a page devoted to a person or event, and most have an 
appropriate picture.  You can read a little background about the person or 
event, and you can heard a related voice.  As the title indicates, the 
sounds are really the focus of each stack.  Here are the sound clips in the 
three stacks (all times approximate):

     I. Before the Second World War
          A. King Edward III of England abdicates the throne, 1936 
             [13 sec.]
          B. Thomas Edison speaks into his own recording device, 1912 
             [2 sec.]
          C. the explosion of the _Hindenburg_ dirigible at Lakehurst, 
             N.J. as reported by Herb Morrison on station WLS, 1937 
             [15 sec.]
          D. Charles Lindbergh addresses New Yorkers on his return to the 
             United States after his solo non-stop flight across the 
             Atlantic, 1927 [8 sec.]
          E. world-famous tenor Enrico Caruso sings "Over There", a song 
             of the first World War (1914-1918) [12 sec.]

     II.  The Second World War
          A. Great Britain's prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, 
             announces his country's declaration of war, September 1939 
             [4 sec.]
          B. part of Prime Minister Winston Churchill's "this was their 
             finest hour" speech, 1940 [10 sec.]
          C. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower announces results of D-Day, June 1944 
             [7 sec.]
          D. United States president Harry Truman
               1. German surrender, May 1945 [9 sec.]
               2. atomic bomb dropped, August 1945 [4 sec.]
          E. Gen. Douglas MacArthur's farewell to Congress, 1951 [6 sec.]
          F. The space shuttle _Challenger_ disaster, January 1986 [8 sec.]

III.  Sports
          A. Farewells from baseball greats
               1. Lou Gehrig, 1939 [5 sec.]
               2. Babe Ruth, 1947 [5 sec.]
          B. 1951 World Series [7 sec.]
          C. 1956 World Series; Yankee pitcher Don Larson has a perfect 
             game [5 sec.]

     I've already confessed my love for programs that use audio well, so I 
expected to like these stacks quite a lot.  In fact, they don't have much 
going for them.  Part of this is undoubtedly due to their age.  All three 
were created in June 1990, when most HyperStudio stacks were still 
relatively primitive.  Regrettably, these three stacks fall into that 
category.  The first two seem like first drafts, and the third seems like 
notes for a stack.

     The layout of these stacks is neither attractive nor consistent.  
They are not logically organized, either.  The sounds in the first stack 
are not in chronological order, nor in any order than I could determine.  
The second stack is largely about the second World War, which is easier to 
take, but adds two later pages--one about the U.S. General Douglas 
MacArthur and one about the space shuttle _Columbia_.  The third stack is 
labelled "sports", but is in fact entirely about baseball.  Even given the 
American nature of the stack, I understand that there are sports played in 
the U.S. other than the "national pastime".

     The scanned photographs and drawings are adequate at best; they are 
sometimes high-contrast reproductions that use no grays.  Twice in the 
short sports stack, illustrations have been used that have nothing to do 
with the event being discussed.  It might have been more sensible to 
construct these pages without photos.  In no case does the photograph make 
its presence felt.

     The accompanying text is often painfully short.  It serves as a 
reminder to someone who already knows about the event or person, but is 
virtually useless as an introduction.  The page about the _Hindenburg_ 
disaster, for instance, does not mention that the _Hindenburg_ was a 
dirigible nor that it exploded.  (Sadly, this text seems even shorter than 
the author intended, because he created a scrolling text field but forgot 
to give the user a chance to scroll it!)  Similarly, the page about the 
_Columbia_ does not even mention the date of the catastrophe, let alone the 
people who died in it.

     The most sensible thing to do may be to keep the disk-based sounds 
and throw away the stacks themselves.  Even then, watch what you keep.  
Copyright questions aside, the snippet of Abbott & Costello's "Who's On 
First?" routine that's attached to the sports stack is so poorly edited 
that the comic timing is mangled.  I also found myself wondering if Lou 
Gehrig's famous farewell was the actual Lou Gehrig or Gary Cooper playing 
him in the 1942 film _The Pride of the Yankees_.

     Still, some sounds are fun.  It's nice to hear what Edison sounded 
like, and I have to admit that Lindbergh and Truman sound very different 
from the way I imagined.  In a few cases, the words being spoken are 
interesting, moving, or justly famous, as in the case of Churchill's 
speech, Edward VIII's abdication, and MacArthur's farewell.  Even 
consequential phrases are interesting, such as when Herb Morrison 
interrupts his remarks to the radio audience to tell a fellow witness to 
"Get out of the way, please."  Anyone who hates overacting as much as I do 
will notice the quiet horror of the final "Oh my God" that finishes the 
_Columbia_ sound clip.

     The idea behind these Sound of History stacks was sound.  
Unfortunately, the execution of that idea is not up to standard of the 
original concept.

Top 10 Files for April
""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     This feature lists the ten most popular files for the month.  To give 
files a chance to seek their own levels, no files will be added to the list 
until they've been in place at least a month.  This month, we look at the 
files uploaded 1-30 April 1996.

     This isn't the Academy Awards ceremony, folks; it's more like the 
People's Choice Awards (both of which are trademarked, by the way).  The 
Top 10 doesn't necessarily tell you what's new and interesting--what files 
_you_ might find interesting--it simply tells you what files have been 
downloaded a lot--what other people found interesting!

     Once again, I'm pleased to find that four different editions of 
GenieLamp A2 occupy four spots in the Top 10 (three April issues, one May 
issue--which was uploaded on the last day of April).  Since the purpose of 
the Top 10 is to keep track of popular files, not just file names, I've add 
two files to the list to make up for the two duplicate GenieLamps.

Review:  Convert 3200
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     PROGRAM:  Convert 3200
     VERSION:  1.0
      AUTHOR:  Brutal Deluxe Software
   PUBLISHER:  Joe Kohn, 166 Alpine Street, San Rafael, CA 94901-1008  USA
       PRICE:  $15
REQUIREMENTS:  Apple IIgs, System 6, 700K of _free_ RAM (not total RAM!)
               4 megabytes RAM, hard disk drive, accelerator all 
               recommended

                                 [*][*][*]


     Convert 3200 is a graphic conversion utility from Brutal Deluxe, the 
French programming team that brought games such as The Tinies to the Apple 
IIgs.  Convert 3200 began life a programmer's utility, so that Brutal 
Deluxe could grab the graphics used in other versions of the game.  Because 
of its origins, Convert 3200 is powerful and it's fast.  Because it's been 
released as a commercial product, it's much easier to use.

     Still, don't assume that Convert 3200 has been designed for ease of 
use.  It's been designed for power and for speed, and has add a "Conversion 
for Clots" interface grafted onto it.  In fact, if you only retain one 
thing from this review, try to make it this:  reading the documentation is 
not optional.  You won't believe me until you try fiddling with the program 
first, but it's for your own good.

     Installing and launching the program are a snap, and the main menu 
screen looks invitingly simple.  After that, things get weird, and fast.

     Convert 3200 has to be told what kind of graphic you're trying to 
load; it doesn't automatically detect graphic type.  Unless you set the 
load type correctly, you're going to see this:

                                A L E R T !

                              LOAD CANCELLED

                              UNKNOWN GRAPHIC
                               FILE FORMAT.

                             CLICK TO CONTINUE

Unknown graphic file format?  Well, that message is misleading.  Convert 
3200 supports a lot of formats:  all the Apple IIgs formats, including 256- 
and 3200-color pictures, plus Compuserve GIF, TIFF, Windows/OS2 BMP, Amiga 
.IFF/ PC .LBM, and Paintbrush PCX.  So Convert 3200 probably does support 
the type of picture you're trying to load.  But if you try to load a GIF 
picture with the load type set to "Apple", then you're going to get the 
"unknown graphic format" error.

     (Because you're naturally cautious the first time you use a program, 
you probably won't commit the above sin.  But I guarantee you that you will 
eventually.  And it will scare the willies out of you.)

     Once you correctly select a graphic for loading, you are going to be 
blown away at how quickly Convert 3200 loads it.  Particularly if you're 
loading from a RAM disk or fast hard drive.  Zowie!

     But then Convert 3200 just sits there.  It doesn't show you what it's 
loaded.  So you click on a few buttons, and you see your graphic--in 
monochrome.  If you haven't read the documentation, or a review like this 
one, you're going to be slightly put off.  Not to worry, you just have to 
visit the conversion screen.  Wear your racing scarf--the conversion speed 
is almost as zippy as the loading speed.  Once the conversion is done, 
Convert 3200 doesn't show you the graphic--you have to click on the "view" 
button.  Then you can save the graphic (3200, 256, 16, 16 grey, or Print 
Shop colors) in a variety of formats (alas, NOT including GIF).

     Does this sound complicated?  Well, it is, a little.  But it's not as 
complicated as it sounds, and you get the hang of it pretty quickly anyway.  
Plus you can automate the whole procedure to automatically convert a whole 
disk full of graphics in one go.  Still, there's no doubt that this program 
reflects its programmers' idiosynchrasies.  It will take you a little while 
to learn how to use the program.  The tutorial will take you through the 
basic process.  You follow the tutorial, then read the main documentation 
file at least as far as the explanation of the shortcut keys.

     Power users will want to read on.  There's a lot of information in 
Chapter XV (How Does It Work?) that can help you to fine-tune your 
conversions.  In fact, there's even a hidden function that lets you mess 
with Convert 3200's conversion rules.

     Convert 3200 does all its conversions in 320 mode.  That can be a 
pain sometimes, particularly with 640-mode GIF graphics.  It imposes 
limitations that are fussy to circumvent.  Also, Convert 3200 doesn't load 
JPEG graphics.

     In a few cases, I got better results using Jonah Stich's 1990 
program, GIF 3200, than with Convert 3200.  This may be due to a limitation 
in me, not in Brutal Deluxe's program, but this is still relevant 
information for newbies.  Mind you, to get that marginally better result, I 
had to wait something like 15 minutes for GIF 3200, as opposed to 15 
seconds for Convert 3200.

     Until now, SuperConvert has been the standard graphic conversion 
program for the Apple IIgs, with the persistent falling back on New 
Concepts' Prism.  (No one seems to remember The Graphics Exchange, for 
which I have a soft spot.)  Convert 3200 may not supplant SuperConvert, but 
it will still probably get used _first_, and get used more often.  Let's 
face it; most of us load a graphics once and then throw it away.  That 
means we want a speedy program, and there's nothing faster than Convert 
3200.  I can't say it's the one to own if you're only buying one, but you 
should definitely buy it.  It's only $15--commercial software for less than 
many shareware products!  If you're serious about graphics conversion, 
you'll want to keep SuperConvert (and The Graphics Exchange and Prism) in 
your arsenal too.  But buy Convert 3200 for sure.
