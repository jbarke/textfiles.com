                               >>> AMEN <<<
                               """"""""""""

     I've been away from home for what seems like a long time.  It's been 
just five years--five hard years.  Ever since I left my home town, my 
parents have always given me the same Christmas present--two plane tickets 
back home for the holidays.  I could wish for nothing finer.

     This year is no exception, yet this year may be an exception.  Don't 
bother re-reading it; I'll explain:  This year's tickets are for a Canadian 
Airlines flight, and that airline is teetering on the brink of collapse.  
I've got the tickets, but I may not get home.  Perhaps a flight home will 
be our Christmas miracle for 1996.

     We had a (minor) Christmas miracle last year, almost exactly a year 
ago today.  My wife Tara and I visited a gift shop that had a display of 
Christmas ornaments.  At the back of the shop, some of the ornaments were 
displayed on a small tree, about knee-high, made of twigs and bare 
branches.  If it sounds downright ugly, blame it on my weak powers of 
description.  That little tree looked mighty good to us.

     Because we fly home for Christmas, my wife and I don't have a 
full-fledged Christmas tree, so we thought this little tree would be our 
chance to start our very own Christmas tradition.  (That's how you can tell 
when you've really left home--you and your partner establish your own 
holiday traditions.)  There was no price tag on it, so we asked the 
saleslady about it.  To our disappointment, the tree was not for sale--it 
was for display purposes only.

     Over the weeks that followed, we searched for a similar tree.  The 
full tale of that search would be tedious to relate, but not half as 
tedious as it was to undergo.  We found endless foot-high trees, visited 
countless stores that had had them the previous year, and in one case, 
arrived just as their last tree was being sold.

     A week before Christmas, we happened to pass the first gift shop.  
Sitting on the floor, stripped of all its ornaments and rather the worse 
for the wear, was our little tree.  We pounced on it before anyone else 
could.  This time, there was a price tag on it.  We bought it and took it 
home.  That was our Christmas miracle for 1995.

     Of course, the story comes with an epilogue.  Two days after buying 
our little tree, they suddenly became available in shops everywhere.  There 
were a scraggly lot--not the same class at all--but there they were, large 
as life and quite as natural.  Have you ever experienced the sensation that 
some force, somewhere, is playing with you, trying to irritate you?  It 
feels darned good to duck such a force; to maintain both your serenity and 
the smile on your face.  Christmas miracles will do that.

                                 [*][*][*]


     One Christmas tradition I've developed as editor of GenieLamp A2 is 
to put the January issue to bed before I leave for Christmas.  That way, I 
get to spend the holiday with no deadline lurking at the back of my mind, 
spoiling the fun.  Last year, I had to start the new year by editing the 
January issue, and you, with your pure mind, would not credit just how 
grouchy it made me.  Just ask Tara sometime.

     This year, I won't have to worry about the January issue, since this 
Christmas issue is my last as editor.  Ryan Suenaga takes over as editor of 
GenieLamp A2 in 1997.  I'll still be submitting an occasional article to 
the new editor.  In fact, I have two SOFTVIEW A2 columns started, and two 
more sketched out.  All I need is time to complete them.

     In 1997, I won't have as much time for editing and writing.  Tara and 
I are moving back to Atlantic Canada soon.  Jobs are scarce there, and I'll 
have to spend the lion's share of my time looking for work.

     Another person who currently has little time for writing is fellow 
Canadian Peter Brickell, who's been writing the REAL WORLD APPLE column.  
There's no installment of that column in this issue, because Peter is out 
in the real world.  The last time I heard from him, he was writing from 
Korea, en route to New Zealand.  He's promised to deliver some material in 
1997, but expect the schedule for Peter's column to be a trifle erratic.

     GenieLamp A2 is almost five years old, and has had just three 
editors.  Next month, you'll meet the fourth.  Most of you probably already 
know Ryan Suenaga from other Apple II journals--he's written for _GS+ 
Magazine_, _The Apple Blossom_, _Juiced.GS_, and the _The AppleWorks 
Gazette_.  If you do know Ryan, you'll recognize that I'm leaving you in 
good hands.

     Thanks, folks.  It's been a wonderful 40 issues.  God bless us, every 
one.

Letters To The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""



OPERATION LAMBDA NOT MISLEADING   In the previous issue of GenieLamp, a 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   letter from Mitchell Spector was 
published that attacked the originality and authenticity of some of my 
programming projects.  I would like to offer this rebuttal.

     First, Mr. Spector claims that many of the "concepts and ideas" in 
Lambda were "borrowed" from another game called Rescue Rover.  All I can 
say in my defense is that I have never played Rescue Rover.  All ideas 
behind Operation Lambda were developed by me, completely from scratch, 
during a rather grueling period this summer in which I racked my brains for 
an original game idea, and, to the extent of my knowledge, successfully 
found one.  As far as I know, no one who has played the full version of 
Lambda has been disappointed.

     Second, Mr. Spector brings up the game PuyoPuyo, which I programmed 
last year and distributed as freeware.  A quick look at the game and docs 
will show that not only did I not claim to do any more than the programming 
(the game itself simply says "Apple IIgs version by Slixter"), my real name 
appears nowhere, and there is no copyright message.  I think it would be 
difficult to claim that I was trying to take credit for other's ideas in a 
release that was intended to be almost anonymous.  Perhaps Mr. Spector's 
"disappointment" would be better targeted at the author of the Mac version, 
who not only "borrowed" the game play, graphics, music, and sound effects 
directly from the SuperFamicon version of the game (without attributing 
credit), but also requested a shareware fee.

     My goal in publishing PuyoPuyo was to simply bring this immensely fun 
and addictive game to the Apple IIgs community.  I did this at some legal 
risk to myself (which may help to explain the anonymity and lack of proper 
credit), but from what I've heard about the enjoyment people have gotten 
from the game, it was worth it.

     My goal in publishing Operation Lambda was to write an exciting, 
original game for the Apple IIgs, and to help pay for college.  A massive 
amount of work went into Lambda's creation, and I am offended that my 
integrity would be attacked simply because there exists some other computer 
game dealing with mirrors and lasers.

COOL SPECTRUM TRICKS   I realised of course we were talking about your 
""""""""""""""""""""   scripts, so I phrased my reply carefully... I could 
have just said the script was bad! :)

     We all learn tricks as we go along, and often projects evolve greatly 
with time.  The CoPilot scripts were of course originally written for TIC 
which only had 8 variables and would limit the use of prefix variables in 
this way.  Spectrum 2.0 and later has no such limitations, other than 
system memory!

     Dave Hecker showed us a neat trick a few days ago for some scripts we 
are writing using the WindowMgr.  The WindowMgr returns resource ID's for 
control hits.  The initial script was:

----
Ext WindowMgr 3 $GenPrefs ReportedHit HitDetails
Match String "ReportedHit" $$0000000A $$00000013 $$00000032 $$000000B9
If Failed Then....
On $Matched GotoNext One, Two, Three, Four
----

     To optimize this he used one of SP's cool tricks:

----
Ext WindowMgr 3 $GenPrefs ReportedHit HitDetails
GotoNext HIT$ReportedHit

        > [ BTW, the first one I found scared me a little. :)  ]

     As far as I know, there are seven Easter Eggs in Convert 3200.  I 
guess you could say that they are all of the 'hidden message' type of 
Easter Egg.  There are six that can be accessed from the main menu screen.

     Hint for Easter Egg hunters:  since Terrell is a "man of God," he 
should be able to locate the seventh Egg fairly easily.

     Let me guess what scared you..."Convert 3200 - The new French bomb."

     Keep in mind that when Brutal Deluxe was working on Convert 3200, the 
French were conducting a number of atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific.  
Although much of the rest of the world was upset about those tests, the 
French thought of them as necessary, and I believe, even felt some 
nationalistic pride about them.

     So, that message refers to the pride that Brutal Deluxe feels for 
Convert 3200.

     In any case, before the program was released, I wrote to Olivier to 
try to explain to him that in US slang, when we call something "a bomb," 
it's not exactly a complimentary term ;-)

     Well, I know that "I believe in God" can be checked, but does it do 
anything beyond that?

     Nope.  The one that said something about "If you want to see me

     I've asked Brutal Deluxe several times what the "I believe in God" 
option does, and have never gotten a serious response.  I'll be honest...I 
have absolutely no idea what clicking on that option does or doesn't 
do...at least in regards to converting graphics.

     That message was a not-so-oblique reference to "Brutal Deluxe's 
LemminGS," and I believe that it also served as an anti-piracy message.

     Of course _you_ bought Convert 3200, but as I so rudely learned this 
week, not everyone who uses Convert 3200 did.  Unfortunately, as I just 
discovered, piracy is still alive in the Apple II world...not 2-3 days ago, 
I downloaded Convert 3200 from the world wide web :-(

     (I'm sorry if any of the above sounds weird...I'm very upset at the

     Neither Brutal Deluxe nor I care to have any kind of copy protection

     The truth of the matter is that 99.9999% of Apple II users are fine 
and upstanding and honest folks.  It's the very rare "bad apple" that can 
cause problems.  But, we don't want the actions of 1 or 2 "bad apples" to 
effect anyone else.

     For me personally, I've been horribly upset these past 6 days.  I 
know that getting as upset as I've been certainly isn't going to do me any 
good, so I need to calm down a little bit more and discuss things further 
with Brutal Deluxe...before deciding what additional action to take.

PeeCees in the catalog for display, they had quite a few macs, a fair 
amount of GSs and a //e!

     They sell some units that accomodate up to 6 "stock" GSs with only a 
few external devices with overhead tables for a printer.  

     I assume becuase they show these machines, they could be of some 
assistance in picking out the right desk for your CPU

     They sell the desk systems that APS sells, (at least they look the 
same) and a wide variety of other items.  

     They look like they have some nice stuff, and aren't afraid of 
throwing some II's and Macs in the catalog.

TWEAKING POSTSCRIPT WITH PUBLISH IT!   Lately, I haven't been able to work 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   on the other two patches to PI that 
we discussed earlier.  (e.g. External font specification from within 
AppleWorks and Symbol/Dingbat Postscript font substitution.)

     I do still plan to work on them, though the latter of the two seems 
much easier to do than the former.

     If anyone _really_ needs info on the first two completed patches 
(external number space specification and the removal of octal character 
trapping), please let me know. I'd prefer to upload all four patches with 
docs at one time, however.

     OTHER TRIVIA:

     It has been asked here (by Jim, I believe) what PI sends to the 
PostScript printer _prior_ to sending the Laserprep file.  I've located the 
following:

     First, it sends

     /md where {/md get / av get cvi 68 eq {(1)}{(2)} ifelse} {(0)} 
ifelse} = flush

     This searches for the existance of Laserprep (md), and returns a '1' 
if the version is 68, and a '2' if the version is other than 68. It returns 
a '0' if 'md' has not been found at all.

     If '0' then, it sends:

     serverdict begin exitserver

     which sets up Laserprep to be 'persistently downloaded', or available 
until the printer is powered down.

     If '2', PI tells you that the LW was intialized with a version other 
than 68, and asks you if you want to reinitialize the printer.

     If '1', PI does _not_ need to intialize the printer (i.e. send 
Laserprep) and begins sending the job.

     Along the way, PI apparently sends numerous status requests, which 
slows things down a bit.  I haven't found this code yet.

<<<<<   FINALLY
"""""
     It appears we have solved the problem with the lack of 
transportability of PublishIt! PostScript Print-to-Disk generated files.

     And, it only takes three lines of code additions to the LASERPREP 
file supplied with PI, which is AKA version 68 of the Laserwriter Driver.

     As you know, even though PI4 provides a print-to-disk option, few of 
us have had any luck getting those _print-to-disk_ PI files to print on 
other systems, or even with our Apple II's connected to Laser printers.  
Jim Goodman came up with one Apple II based workaround by first 
initializing his printer with a PI4 blank page, and then sending his 
print-to-disk files from ProTerm3.  His questions of 'What else must PI4 be 
sending?' got me to looking into the internals of PI.

     So...

     To make this work, rename your 'LASERPREP' file from the PI disk as 
'PRINT.LASERPREP' and name a _copy_ of it 'LASERPREP'.

     Then use a text editor (e.g. ProTerm or AppleWorks 5.x {it deals with 
TXT files much better than 3.0 does, and has capability for _very_ large 
file sizes}) to add the following two lines to the _start_ of the copied 
LASERPREP file:

          systemdict
          serverdict begin exitserver

     Then, to the _end_ of the LASERPREP file, embed a CTRL-D (ascii 13). 
Do this in the ProTerm editor with the 'CTRL-P'  'D' sequence, or from 
within AppleWorks with the .storechar dot command from within a macro. {I 
haven't tried this with a High ASCII CTRL-D, or the CTRL-T change type key 
sequence might work.}  Some of the low-ASCII cntrl characters will cause 
weird screen effects in AppleWorks, though.

     Save the changes to the LASERPREP file.  That's it.  Now, when you 
print to disk and use the file elsewhere, it should print.  For normal 
direct printing with PI, though, be sure and use the original LASERPREP 
file, not the modified copy. (Though I haven't tried it otherwise. It may 
not hurt to use it, except for memory wasting.)

     What I _think_ this does is first place the system dictionary on top 
of the stack {systemdict} (as opposed to the user dictionary), then set up 
'md' (LASERPREP) to be persistently downloaded {serverdict begin 
exitserver}.

     The CTRL-D is the postscript end-of-file character, and signals the 
end of the persistant download.  The actual PI4 file then immediately calls 
up the 'md' dictionary that was just persistantly downloaded and begins to 
reference it.  Without the CTRL-D, the PI4 file never gets executed on its 
own.  Plus, I _think_ some code in the LASERPREP file may flush to the end 
of the file if it discovers it is already present.  This would flush the 
PI4 file component too if the CTRL-D end-of-file character weren't present.

     If you do use ProTerm to send these files, remember that LASERPREP 
sets a fairly long end-of-job timeout.  So, you may want to send a 'quit' 
or another CTRL-D at the end of your transmission, if you plan to send 
another file soon.

     I don't have a MAC.  If calling the systemdict might mess something 
up, you can try deleting the first line given above, and replacing the 
second line with:

          serverdict begin 0 exitserver

     This also prints on an Apple II.  Notice the addition of the '0'.  
The first method, however, is how PI4 sends the file.

     BTW, if you think this was a rambling explanation, I agree. <g>  I'll 
clean it up when the other patches are ready for uploading.

"""""

     I've noticed that the dictionary in the 6.0.1 Laserwriter driver is 
called 'GSd'.  PublishIt! expects to see 'md'.

     If you have a hacker spirit, you may try changing the Laserwriter 
driver - (on a _copy_ only) to 'md' and then see what happens.

     If it works, I imagine that PI could be changed to reference 'GSd' 
instead of 'md', but doggoneit, it could be 'fun' to squeeze in that extra 
byte without the source code.

LEMMINGS--LATEST   It looks like Brutal Deluxe's LemminGS is getting close

     I just downloaded the latest 20 levels, so 80 of the 90 planned 
levels now appear to be completed.  But, I guess I won't be able to 
personally confirm that until I finally figure out how to get past Level 49 
;-)

     Actually, Olivier says that there will be 92 levels, but I'm just not 
sure yet if those final 2 levels will be Easter Eggs or what.  Apparently, 
Level 91 will be dedicated to the beta test team, and Level 92 will be 
designed by Olivier.  He says now that Level 92 will only look impossible 
to complete.

     The biggest surprise found in his note to the beta test team was that 
Brutal Deluxe plans to complete the game by early December.  Of 1996, that 
is.

     Will they, or won't they?  Stay tuned for details.

SOME OLD APPLE IIE/IIC BACK "IN PRINT"?   In regards to those 8 bit games 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   that I purchased from BRCC...I 
have to admit that I get a real kick out of offering Apple II software for 
unbelievable pricing.  And, it's obvious to me now that when it comes to 
older software, people will only purchase it for "unbelievable pricing."

     After all, I've had boxes and boxes of software taking up room in the 
SSII warehouses, and it was only after I offered 15+ boxes of software for 
$50 that it started to sell.

     In an attempt to put together yet another low cost "entertainment 
bundle," it looks like I'll be able to do that again...but on a somewhat 
limited basis.  I located a few more IIe/IIc games that are out of print, 
so maybe in a week or two, I'll be able to offer the "That's Entertainment" 
bundle.

     Because some of the titles will still be available in only limited 
quantities, I think I'll make that package available only to Genie 
subscribers.  That way, it'll be easy for folks to check on availability.

     Stay tuned for details.

Lordlings of Yore
"""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
       [D.CUFF]



     _Lordlings of Yore_ (subtitled "The Game of Knights, Knaves and 
Necromancers") is a strategy game set sometime around Britain's 12th 
century, give or take a century.  The game is designed for four players, 
but the computer will stand in for any absentees, so you can play all by 
your lonesome.  You battle the three other lordlings in an attempt to mass 
the biggest armies and control the most peasants.  You can use magic to 
accomplish what brute force cannot.

     The game includes a 24-page manual packed with information.  You 
should at least glance at it before playing--this isn't the sort of game 
you pick up as go along.

     All you need to run this game is an Apple II with 48K, a 5.25" disk 
drive, and a monitor.  A printer is optional, but a good idea if you have a 
printer compatible with the game.  If you have an Apple II with lower case, 
be sure to keep the Caps Lock key down throughout.

CHOOSING YOUR GAME   The game opens with a visual pun--a scrolling 
""""""""""""""""""   animation technique used to open a scroll (as 
"medieval" music plays).  You begin by starting a new game or loading an 
old one.

     You start a new game by choosing the number of human players, plus a 
name, a password, and a level for each.  Your name can be anything you 
want--but be advised that "Lord Tom" looks really incongruous to anyone who 
knows anything about the nobility.  (If your name is Clarence Threepwood, 
you're probably not Lord Threepwood either.  You're Lord Emsworth--your 
title doesn't necessarily have anything to do with your name.)  I mention 
this only because the computer will be choosing more authentic-looking 
names, and your "Lord Tom" might look odd alongside them.  You can change 
your name in the middle of the game if you don't like it.

     You can have a password that's 1-4 characters long, or you can just 
press Return, which effectively ignores the password feature.  Your 
password can also be changed in the middle of a game.

     The level (1-4) merely refers to the troops and gold that each player 
starts with.  Buried in the middle of the manual is the suggestion that new 
human players be given the maximum gold and troops and computer players be 
given the minimum.  It's good advice.  There will always be four players, 
and the computer will play any roles not selected by a human.  Don't be so 
soft-hearted as to give the computer players an even break.

     The final opportunity to customize your game comes with the terrain 
modifiers.  If you like, you can have more mountains, more forests, and 
more swamps, or any combination thereof.  When you're learning the game, 
it's better to keep the terrain as uncomplicated as possible.

THE GAME BEGINS   Once your Apple II has sorted out the four players, it 
"""""""""""""""   randomly assigns each of you to one of the four shires.  
(Unfortunately, it doesn't give you a list of the players and their 
respective shires.  And player numbers are important.)  Each shire has a 
map of 49 squares (7x7) and has a home castle in one square.  The other 48 
squares may be a certain type of terrain, which affects battle outcome, or 
hold groups of 100-400 peasants (for a total of 5000 peasants), all of 
which you get to tax.  As long as the other players don't occupy the 
squares with those peasants.  Squares can also be occupied by fog, 
maelstroms, and dragons--magic conjured by one of the four necromancers.

     Each turn in _Lordlings of Yore_ has six phases.  For your first 
turn, only four of the six phases are available.  The first phase concerns 
the Necromancer.  You can have your necromancer cast a spell.  Two spells 
are free--the rest have to be requested and paid for on your previous turn.  
You'll already appreciate that this game requires planning and forethought!  
Spells require either a map coordinate (A-1 through N-14) or a unit number 
(1-A through 4-Z).  Frankly, this is every bit as confusing as it sounds, 
and there's no chance to glance at the map at this stage.  Often, there's 
no graceful way to back out of a spell if you've chosen it before you know 
the correct coordinate or number.  There's little your Necromancer can 
accomplish on your first turn.  Your Necromancer can be killed; if he is, 
this phase of the game disappears.

     The second phase of a game is the Treasury phase.  You can spend your 
gold on knights, men at arms (footsoldiers), appeasement (give the peasants 
some return on their taxes or they'll get rambunctious), spells from your 
necromancer, bribery, and intelligence.  You'll probably find knights, men 
at arms, and spells vital, but don't neglect appeasement nor overlook the 
value of intelligence.  Bribery has no guaranteed value--players can accept 
your bribes and then ignore your requests without penalty.

     The third phase of a game is Deployment.  You get to move knights and 
men from your castle in units.  You can have 26 units active at a time, 
though you'll usually have significantly less.  You assign each unit a 
letter to identify it.

     The fourth phase is Movement.  This phase is not available on your 
first turn.  You cannot move a unit that you've just deployed--and since, 
on your first turn, the only units that exist are ones that have just been 
deployed, there's nothing to move!  Units can move north, south, east, or 
west, one square at a time.  In the movement phase, for each unit, you can 
choose to hold where you are, deploy the unit (split into other units), 
plus get a roster of your units, and a few other options.

     The fifth phase is Combat.  This phase is also not available on your 
first turn.  When one of your units runs into an enemy unit, battle 
results, and the outcome turns on how strong each unit is.  You can advance 
or retreat... or have your unit wiped out (that is, all knights and men are 
killed).

     The sixth phase is the Options phase, which lets you perform some 
housekeeping, like changing your name or password, saving a game, resigning 
from the game, sending a message to another player, or printing a map or 
roster.  Unfortunately, printing doesn't work on my Apple IIgs.  Oddly, 
when I try to print, the game boots my GS from slot 7 (even when that's not 
the boot slot).  Of course, the programmer couldn't foresee the standard 
Apple IIgs set-up in 1985, but it would have been nicer if he had allowed 
players to tell the program what slot the printer was in.

PLAYING THE GAME   Because strategy games have never appealed to me, I 
""""""""""""""""   wasn't prepared to enjoy this game, but I did.  The game 
involves you--at least, I found myself drawn into it.

     _Lordlings of Yore_ is very easy to play, but not at all easy to win. 
 Heck, it's not even easy to finish.  This is not a quick game.  I hate 
reviews from reviewers who have barely glanced at a product, so I allowed 
muself over a month to review _Lordlings of Yore_.  (Incidentally, this 
explains why it is that you're unlikely to see the first review of a 
commercial product in GenieLamp A2.)

     Normally, over a month would be ample time to review a game, but each 
game of _Lordlings of Yore_ takes a long time to play out--three or four 
hours of play at a time, and even then you won't finish in one sitting.  
With a game taking something like 90 turns, you're going to need that saved 
game feature.  After agreeing to help in the review by providing a second 
human player, my wife advised that players to "bring a novel".  We were two 
humans playing against two computer opponents, and each time the computer 
took a turn, it wasn't quick, even though the computer is lots quicker than 
a human player and even though we weren't shown any of the six phases.

     During another player's turn, you're supposed to walk away from the 
screen if it's a human player.  If it's a computer player, all that happens 
is that the name of the computer player is shown while the dirty work takes 
place.  If there's a combat phase during a computer player's turn, you're 
informed of that, and each skirmish is accompanied by a few noises from the 
speaker (which quickly become irritating).

     The fact that you don't get to see what's happening during other 
players' turns means that this isn't a game for woolgatherers.  By the time 
you regain control of the keyboard, you may find that two of your units 
have disappeared--but you're not notified of this in any way.  It's up to 
you notice it when you look at the map or at the roster.  Same thing if 
you've lost knights or men from a unit during a battle.

     There's an awful lot to keep track of, and the game isn't designed to 
be of as much help as it should be.  When you're asked which unit you want 
to spy on, or which square you want to land a dragon in, there's no chance 
to refresh your memory with a quick glance at the map.  You'd better have a 
phenomenal memory, a printer that works with _Lordlings of Yore_, or a pad 
of graph paper.

     The most discouraging part of the game is that the computer players 
are so much darned better.  Why shouldn't they be?  They understand every 
possible nuance of play, and they can keep track of more than most humans 
can.

     You don't have to be a practised strategy gamer to enjoy Lordlings of 
Yore, but on the other hand, I wouldn't try to play it with anyone who had 
never played any sort of computer game before.  You need some understanding 
of the vagaries of computers to tackle _Lordlings of Yore_, but don't worry 
too much about it.  If you've cut your teeth on Raster Blaster and 
Milestones 2000, you're ready to become a lordling.

     The use of animation on the maps is a nice small touch.  When fog or 
a dragon have been conjured to pester you, instead of a simple little icon 
on the hi-res screen, there's a short animation.

     Not every attempt to make the game attractive works.  The game uses 
two custom hi-res fonts, and both are more irritating than they are 
legible.  (The font in the manual, also meant to lend a period feel, was 
also a mistake.)  This illegibility matters most when trying to read the 
letters of enemy units.  If you don't know whether the "Olde English" font 
is display an C, E, or F, it's going to be impossible to get information on 
it.  The cursor for both the large and small font is a coat of arms.  This 
cutesy feature doesn't get in the way of the game, but it doesn't add 
anything either.

STEPPING BACK IN TIME   When I received my review copy of _Lordlings of 
"""""""""""""""""""""   Yore_, I felt for a moment as though I had been 
transported back in time.  Fresh in its shrink-wrapped package was a game 
with a 1985 copyright date.

     (I asked John Hudson of Hudson's Hobby Games, who supply the game, 
about this.  Had he uncovered a motherlode of old Apple II games?  No, Mr 
Hudson is a friend of Jon Baxley, the designer of the game.)

     There are minor irritations due to the game's age.  Apart from not 
being able to print using an Apple IIgs and an ImageWriter II attached to 
the printer port, there's no support for the delete key.  The game 
sometimes recognizes lower-case key pressed, but other times does not--it's 
better to keep your Caps Lock key on at all times.  There's no reason NOT 
to keep Caps Lock depressed, because there's no real support for lower case 
input.  If you type your name as "Ickenham", the game will address you 
throughout as "Lord ICKENHAM".  This also gets a bit irritating when 
receiving messages from other human players.  A second 5.25" drive is not 
supported--when saving games, you must swap your program disk and your 
saved game disk.  

     All these are fairly minor irritations.  On the whole, the game holds 
up pretty well considering it's at least 11 years old.  The game's age also 
means that it's available at a bargain price--$10!  And that includes 
shipping inside the United States.  (Outside the U.S., add $5.)

SUMMARY   _Lordlings of Yore_ is never likely to become a classic nor a 
"""""""   crowd pleaser, but anyone who has a bit of time to invest in 
games-playing will enjoy this game, even if she or he is not experienced 
with strategy games.  The complexity level of this game is about 
medium--too involved to merely dabble in, but not so complicated that you 
have be Nikola Tesla just to survive three moves.  The design of the game 
is not great--it doesn't use the abilities of a computer to its full 
advantage--but it is good enough that it hardly shows its age, a decade 
after it was conceived.  The bargain price of $10 should help sales.

Top 10 Files for October
""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
       [D.CUFF]



     This feature lists the ten most popular files for the month.  To give 
files a chance to seek their own levels, no files will be added to the list 
until they've been in place at least a month.  This month, we look at the 
files uploaded 1-31 October 1996.

     This isn't the Academy Awards ceremony, folks; it's more like the 
People's Choice Awards (both of which are trademarked, by the way).  The 
Top 10 doesn't necessarily tell you what's new and interesting--what files 
_you_ might find interesting--it simply tells you what files have been 
downloaded a lot--what other people found interesting!

     This month, the October and November issues of GenieLamp A2 occupy a 
total of eight spots on the list (five and three, respectively), but we're 
just counting each issue as one file each.  We hope this explains why there 
are 17 files on the Top 10 list.

JPEGS.1.1.BXY   jpeGS v1.1 by Mark Marr-Lyon lets you view JPEG graphics 
"""""""""""""   (so popular on the World Wide Web).  It will take advantage 
of a SecondSight video card, but will work without one.  Its preview, 
grayscale, and ratio controls help speed up the viewing of each graphic.  
This new version is faster than the previous one.  Freeware.

A2.DOM.9610.BXY   marks the return of the Genie A2 RoundTable disk of the 
"""""""""""""""   month.  (The disk did not appear for three months, July 
through September.)  In addition to the July and October issues of 
GenieLamp A2, the October disk features Computer Keyboarding by Charlie 
Hartley (now freeware), PUFF by Craig Peterson--a collection of ampersand 
enhancements for Applesoft BASIC, Scavenger Hunt USA by Charlie Hartley 
(also now freeware), and SWAPSCSI by Craig Peterson, an added BASIC command 
for users of the Apple Rev. C SCSI card.  All these can be used on an Apple 
II.  For Apple IIgs users, there's CoolWriter GS v3.0 by Rolf Braun, a 
stand-alone text editor/word processor.

ALMP9610.BXY   All five editions of the October issue of GenieLamp A2 make 
""""""""""""   it into the most popular files this month.  Features include 
the second installment of Peter Brickell's REAL WORLD APPLE column, an 
APPLE ANECDOTE about personal programming highlights from editor Doug Cuff, 
a song parody from unofficial Apple II historian Steve Weyhrich, and three 
gems from the library.  In order of popularity:  the packed text version, 
the AppleWorks word processor version, the HyperStudio version, the 
unpacked text version, and the HyperCard version.

SORRY.BXY   Sorry by Russ Nielson is a word game with a certain resemblance 
"""""""""   to Hangman.  The implementation is terrifically attractive.  
There are plenty of word lists, and a program to help you add your own.  
For more details, see last month's PD_QUICKVIEW column.  Freeware.

ALMP9611.BXY   Three editions of the November issue of GenieLamp A2 make it 
""""""""""""   into the most popular files this month.  Features include 
the third installment of Peter Brickell's REAL WORLD APPLE column, a look 
at Russ Nielson's word game Sorry, a chart of GenieLamp A2 back issues, and 
a brief history of GenieLamp.  In order of popularity:  the packed text 
version, the HyperStudio version, and the AppleWorks word processor 
version.  (This makes the first time that the HyperStudio version has been 
#2!)

PT3.1INET.BXY   Three ProTERM A2 v3.1 Genie Internet Macros by Art 
"""""""""""""   Coughlin.  The first macro loads your bookmark file into 
the ProTERM editor, sets VT100 emulation and full duplex, and takes you 
through Genie's Internet gateway to Lynx.  The second returns from Genie's 
Internet gateway, emulation and duplex, and logs you off.  The third macro 
pastes a URL from the bookmark file to the modem.  There is also a bonus 
macro--you'll have to download the file to find out what it is.  Freeware.

NOV96.DESK.BXY   These 42 files from Pat Kern are .INI format, meaning they 
""""""""""""""   can be used to create new background for IIgs desktop 
programs.  All freeware.

     o  APPLE96.INI:  a red apple with a green leaf still attached, and a 
        November 1996 calendar.

     o  BIRTHDAY.INI:  a round two-layer cake with white icing and seven 
        purple candles on a light blue background.

     o  BUBBLES3.INI:  3x5 grid of bubbles; each large bubble is 
        surrounded by five smaller bubbles.

     o  CIRCLE.INI:  5x6 grid of white circles with red outlines on a dark 
        blue background.

     o  DISK1A1.INI:  5x6 grid of blue 3.5" disks with labels on a white 
        background.

     o  DISK1A2.INI:  same as DISK1A1.INI (above), but with a light blue 
        background.

     o  DISK2.INI:  the reverse side of one large 3.5" disk--the side with 
        the hub and write protect tab, not the label--on a light blue 
        background.

     o  DOWNOUT96.INI:  a frazzled cartoon figure lies prone on the ground 
        over the legend:  "If at first you don't succeed... / call it 
        version 1.0".  There is also a November 19965 calendar.

     o  FROGG.INI:  a nice drawing of a small frog clutching a branch or 
        reed, on a white background.  In my opinion, one of the three best 
        in this archive.

     o  FROGGY.INI:  same as FROGG.INI (above), but on a green background.

     o  HIBISCUS2.INI:  a large hibicus on a white background and a large 
        pink border.

     o  HIBISCUS3.INI:  same as HIBISCUS2.INI, but with a white border.

     o  HIBSCUS1.INI:  same as HIBISCUS2.INI, but with a black background.

     o  HRN.PLNT96.INI:  a colorful cornucopia (horn of plenty) on a white 
        background, with a November 1996 calendar.

     o  HRN.PLNTA.INI:  same as HRN.PLNT96.INI (above), but shifted 
        slightly up and to the left, and no calendar.

     o  HRN.PLNTB.INI:  same as HRN.PLNTA.INI (above), but with a black 
        background.

     o  LOOPSA.INI:  ~6x10 grid of color red/yellow/orange loops on a blue 
        background.

     o  LOOPSBB.INI:  ~4x6 grid of loops--similar to those in LOOPSA.INI 
        but larger--on a blue background.

     o  MOUSEWRTR96.INI:  a mouse with a bottle of ink and a piece of 
        paper is writing a letter, using his tail as the quill!  Also a 
        November 1996 calendar, on a pink background.

     o  NORODENT.INI:  stylized drawing of a mouse (the kind that eats 
        cheese, not the computer input device) and a red Euroslash on a 
        blue background.  In my opinion, one of the three best in this 
        archive.

     o  NOUVEA1.INI:  an ornate drawing which includes a classically 
        dressed young female, on a yellow background.

     o  PERIODIC.INI:  a periodic table of elements on a dark blue 
        background--alas, there's not enough resolution to be able to read 
        all the data in the table.

     o  PHSNT.INI:  a colorful drawing of a pheasant in the woods.

     o  PHSNT96.INI:  same as PHSNT.INI (above), but with a November 1996 
        calendar.

     o  POPPY96.INI:  colored line drawing of a poppy, with a November 
        1996 calendar, on a blue background.

     o  SAFETY.INI:  colorful drawing of confetti and streamers on a black 
        background, with the legend "The designated driver is the life of 
        the party."  In my opinion, one of the three best in this archive.  
        Possibly I'm biased here, since I don't drink and am usually the 
        designated driver at family gatherings.

     o  SNOW.INI:  blue and white snow stretches to the horizon.

     o  SNOW96.INI:  same as SNOW.INI (above), but with a November 1996

        (yellow?) background.

        image inverted laterally (a mirror image) and a black background.

        November 1996 calendar.

        giving thanks for their bowls of soup.  The legend reads:  "Thank 
        you, Lord, for everything."

     o  THANK.YOU96.INI:  similar to THANK.YOU.INI, except the graphic has 
        been moved right of center and a November 1996 calendar has been 
        place left.

     o  THANKSGIVIN.INI:  a large, more realistically rendered cornucopia 
        (horn of plenty).

     o  TILEA.INI:  diamond tiles, subtly shaded with gray on gray.

     o  TILEB.INI:  as above, but with green/gray.

     o  TILEC.INI:  as above, but with black/pink.

     o  VETERANS.INI:  an American flag and text on a blue background.  
        The text reads:  "In honor of our trues heroes / This Veteran's Day 
        / Take time to remember our heroic veterans / To those who have 
        served / to protect our great nation, / let us salute them in our 
        memories and thoughts / with heartfelt gratitude."

     o  WTR.LILY.INI:  a water lily on a white background.

        (above).

     o  WTR.LILYB.INI:  same as WTR.LILYA.INI (above), but with a black 
        background.

desktop programs.  All freeware.

     o  CATMC.INI:  a night scene featuring and a black cat and a bat 
        flying in front of the moon--also in the sky is a "collision" of

     o  DEVILA.INI:  silhouettes of eight devils (four large, four small) 
        on a red background.

     o  FLAMSKUL.INI:  a large grinning death's head in the centre of a 
        flame.

     o  GHOSTA.INI:  a simple, scary rendition of a ghost on an orange

        one of the five best in this archive.

     o  HALLOW.INI:  a haunted tower and a dead tree--HAPPY HALLOWEEN also 
        appears

     o  HALLOWEEB.INI:  a checkerboard pattern featuring small

        best in this archive.

     o  HALLOWN.INI:  in the foreground, a large cheerful jack-o-lantern 
        sitting on the pavement; in the background a row of houses... and a 
        couple of ghosts.

     o  HLWEEN2.INI:  a young, attractive with on a broomstick flying in 
        front of the moon, with the legend:  HALLOWEEN... WITCHES... BOO

     o  PUMKFACE.INI:  just the carved eyes, nose, mouth, and scar of a 
        jack-o-lantern's face; yellow (green?) on white.

        cat; resolution not so good.

     o  PUMPKN2.INI:  cheerful, goofy drawing of a one-toothed 
        jack-o-lantern.

        legend HAPPY HALLOWEEN.

        archive.

FROM THE AUTHOR   You are B. J. Blazkowicz, the greatest spy and biggest 
"""""""""""""""   risk-taker the Allied forces have ever known.  The Second 
World War has been raging for two years, and your mission was to infiltrate 
the Nazi fortress Castle Hollehammer and retrieve Hitler's twisted plans 
for building the perfect army.  Rumors have it that one of Hitler's most 
maniacal scientists, Dr. Schabbs, has perfected a technique for building 
fierce armies from the bodies of the dead.  As bizarre and unreal as it 
sounds, you were sent to investigate.

     You failed.  Captured as you attempted to grab the plans, you were 
taken to the Nazi prison, Castle Wolfenstein, for questioning and certain 
execution.  You've been held here for twelve long days, deep in the 
dungeons beneath the castle.  Just beyond your cell door sits a single 
brutish Nazi guard, who helped torture you a few hours ago with a cattle 
prod.

     You can't take it anymore!  Quivering pathetically in the corner, you 
beg for medical care in exchange for information.  The guard smugly grins 
and reaches for his keys.  He opens the cell door, the tumblers in the lock 
grinding noisily, the sound echoing down the dark corridors.  The door 
squeaks open... the guard comes through...

     A quick blow to the knee takes him down.  You grab his knife and 
finish him quietly.  Standing over him, you quickly take his gun.  Trapped 
in the bowels of the Nazi prison, you must escape.  If you fail, you will 
surely die.

PD_Q COMMENTS   It took a long time, but Castle Wolfenstein is once again 
"""""""""""""   available for the Apple II, the computer platform that 
started it all.  MUSE Software released Castle Wolfenstein for the Apple II 
in the early 1980s, and followed it up with Beyond Castle Wolfenstein.  In 
the first game, you had to escape the prison.  In the second, you had to 
plant a bomb to assassinate Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, and then get out, 
preferably before the bomb detonated.

     Those early MUSE game were fun to play.  They were two of the few to 
use digitized voices--the German guards and S.S. officers calling to me to 
pay attention or follow them always managed to make me jump.  Both games 
had a few irritating aspects, however.  The machinations one had to go 
through in order to move your character and/or point a weapon were tortuous 
beyond the telling.  The maps of the castle were just a little crude.

     Long after MUSE Software had lost the source code to these two games, 
three-dimensional versions of Castle Wolfenstein began showing up on other 
computers--Macintosh and IBM compatibles--but not for the Apple II.  
Wolfenstein 3-D showed you the rooms and hallways you travelled from the 
player's point of view.  DOOM is essentially Wolfenstein 3-D that allows 
for multiple players.  In all incarnations, the point of this game is the 
same:  run around and shoot everything that moves and pick up everything 
that doesn't.

     If you found the history of Castle Wolfenstein tedious and arcane, 
you'll want to skip the history of Wolfenstein 3-D IIgs at Logicware.  In 
fact, I feel like skipping it.  So I will.  Suffice it to say that it's 
incredible that Wolfenstein 3-D IIgs has made it as far as a beta version 
of a demonstration copy.

     The demo, while limited to three short levels, is pretty fairly 
operational.  You get to run around the hallways and rooms, firing at 
anything that moves.  This includes guards, members of the SS, killer dogs, 
and, in one case, a three-armed mutant.  Other nasties, including Hitler, 
will appear in the full-blown version, but that's it for the demo.

     As you tear around Castle Wolfenstein, you also get to pick up 
bullets, back packs, machine guns, chain guns, first aid kits, food, keys, 
and treasure.  Not to mention power-ups (spheres containing pictures of 
your character which restore you to full health and give you another life).  
The fully-enabled game has a few other objects--notably nastier 
weapons--but, once again, that's it for the demo.

     Wolfenstein 3-D has a few features not available in the originals (to 
the best of my memory).  Wolf 3-D has an automap feature--just press Tab 
and you can see a map of the level you're on--at least, the rooms you've 
already seen.  I don't remember any secret doors in Castle Wolfenstein 
(possibly in Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, but don't quote me)--in Wolf 3-D, 
finding hidden sections of the castle not only increases your score, it 
increases your chances.

     I'm not much for any sort of arcade game, much less a shoot-'em-up, 
but I have to confess that I love Wolfenstein 3-D.  Heck, just being able 
to run around the castle would be a kick.

     In the original Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein, you 
could chose to control your character via the keyboard or the joystick.  
Which was worse?  Both, but for different reasons.  Keyboard control was 
viciously involved and complicated.  Joystick control wasn't accurate 
enough.  With Wolfenstein 3-D IIgs, I'm happy to report that you get to 
choose between keyboard control and mouse control, and both work just fine.

     The graphics in Wolfenstein 3-D IIgs are colorful and 
three-dimensional, but the resolution isn't anything to write home about.  
(Finer resolution would make the game run so slowly that watching grass 
grow would be enthralling by comparison.)  This low resolution sometimes 
make it difficult to tell if that splotch of color in the distance is a 
guard or a plant stand.  You can reduce or enlarge the game window by 
pressing Apple-1 (the smallest) through Apple-7 (the largest).  The smaller 
the window, the faster the game runs.  If you're going to have the largest 
window, you're going to want a pretty zippy accelerator--the documentation 
recommends a clock speed of 10 mHz or faster.

     Speaking of accelerators, the documentation recommends some kind of 
ZipGS or TransWarp GS accelerator just to play the game.  It is possible to 
play on a stock 2.8 mHz Apple IIgs, but the game is a little sluggish.  
This matters most in the combat phase--you can't seem to pull the trigger 
quickly enough.

     There are currently no sounds effects--the sound effects file was 
expected to be released the day after the demo was, and it's beginning to 
look as though it won't be available until the full-blown version is ready.  
That means that all events trigger the same sound (or no sound).  Since a 
beep usually announces an enemy entering the room and/or firing at you, you 
feel you have to pay attention to every beep.  This can be embarrassing 
when you whirl around at the sound of a beep, only to find that it's the 
door closing behind you.

     The demo comes with three pieces of music--one for the start of the 
game, one for between levels, and one for winning.  The documentation 
doesn't speculate--probably wisely--on how much music the finished game 
will have nor when it will play.

     My biggest complaint with the Wolf 3-D demo is that it's only a demo 
and, as such, is too darned short.  (On the other hand, it does mean I 
haven't gotten frustrated by being unable to get past the high-level 
baddies.)  I'm looking forward to the release of the full game--which will 
be FREEWARE--sometime in 1997!
