           >>> "COME GATHER 'ROUND PEOPLE WHEREVER YOU ROAM" <<<
           """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Up here in Canada, there's been an awful lot of fuss recently about 
Bob Dylan's song "The Times They Are A-Changin'" appearing in a television 
advertisement for a bank.  A bank!  It makes you want to wash.

     The 30-second version of advert is pretty well done (kudos to the 
sound editor):  full of heart-warming, life-celebrating, "motherhood issue" 
shots that make it impossible to tell who the sponsor is until they 
identify themselves in the final seconds.  (Hence the horror after those 
final seconds.)  The first time I saw it, I suspected it was touting for a 
phone company or perhaps a religious group.  Manipulative, but I admired 
the technique until I saw the name of the bank, at which point I choked on 
my root beer.

     The advert features a throng of children too young to know that the 
song they're lip-synching wasn't just written for the ad.  That doesn't 
help.

     After Michael Jackson's bunch got hold of the Beatles catalog and 
hawked "Revolution" to Nike, you think we'd be inured.  After Mick Jagger 
let Bill Gates start up the Windows 95 campaign, who cares?

     Lots of people up here seem to care.  Some care that Dylan has sold 
out.  (Though I think that happened a long time ago.)  Some don't care 
about the selling out but care about the trashing of their memories.  (If 
the phrase "half-naked, exploding porpoises" rings a bell, then further 
explanation is superfluous.)  A bank!  What's more, a bank I personally 
happen to loathe, placing it second from the bottom in terms of how it 
treats its customers.

     Dylan defenders have rushed to point out that it's Bob Dylan's song.  
He can license it to whoever he darn well pleases.  And we've got a hell of 
a nerve complaining about it.

     Still, this issue has been getting a lot of airplay on Canadian 
radio.  (I don't watch much TV.)  So much so that after just one 
day--everyone seems to start covering a story on the exact same day--I was 
sick of the whole issue.  I felt like gathering everybody I knew in the 
town park, and lead the whole works in all five verses of "The Times They 
Are A-Changin'", over and over, until we were hoarse.  Or until the entire 
community participated, which meant that everyone would associate the song 
with good feelings, and not some thrice-cursed television spot.

     Then it dawned on me that someone had already thought of that.  I was 
listening to a regional radio call-in program in the lunchtime slot.  The 
female host had a musician guest, and they wanted callers to share the 
songs they remembered and the memories they associated with the songs.  
(The Dylan/bank issue wasn't raised.)  It started nice but dull, but then I 
noticed something.  When the musician played a tune on his guitar, he'd 
start to sing the lyrics.  And the host would join in (and a fine singing 
voice she had, too).  Then the caller would join in.  Community singing 
over the air?  In Canada?  Most Canadians are shy about singing their 
national anthem in a stadium--forget singing to radio audience.

     It got better.  A caller who knew the musician called in and told a 
charming story about one of the musician's songs.  Then a caller who knew 
the host called in and played a bootleg tape of her singing with her band, 
back before she turned to radio announcing.  I've heard this call-in show 
before, folks--it's never turned into Old Home Week.  It took me awhile to 
realize what the producers were saying, since they weren't saying it 
overtly.  It was quietly charming, and it was fun.

     For one marvelous moment, we focussed on the feelings that songs 
reminded of us, found the community spirit that is lying dormant, and it 
was good.  I can't carry a tune in a ten-gallon bucket, but somehow I still 
feel like singing.

     A sense of community is particularly important to me these days.  You 
see, next month's issue of GenieLamp A2 will be my 40th--and also my last.  
Ryan Suenaga will be taking over the post.  Ryan is becoming increasingly 
well known in the Apple II community.  He's written for Juiced.GS, The 
Apple Blossom, The AppleWorks Gazette and even allowed GenieLamp A2 to 
reprint one of his Top 10 messages (Humor Online, February 1996).  I think 
all I really need to say about Ryan is that he's lived in Hawai'i all his 
life, and only left the islands twice--both times for KansasFests.  This is 
a serious Apple II person.  Get ready for him, starting in 1997.

     I'm not resigning because I want to--I'm resigning because it's time 
for me to leave.  I'm not leaving the Apple II world--I just bought a ROM 
03 GS for my wife, as a matter of fact, and I'll probably keep writing for 
GenieLamp A2 as long my articles come up to Ryan's high standards.

     Still, it's time for me to live.  I'm an Atlantic Canadian--a 
Newfoundlander--despite the fact that I've been living in Ontario for the 
past five years.  My wife and I moved to Ontario so that my wife could 
attend university here.  (Yes, there are universities in Atlantic Canada, 
but none that could afford to offer a substantial scholarship.)  This 
spring, my wife will finish her master's degree in computer science, and 
we'll be heading back to Atlantic Canada.  That means I have to start 
looking for a job there now.  And that just isn't possible if I remain 
editor of GenieLamp A2.  You would not credit how much of my time I spend 
putting this magazine together.  Anyway, I'll still be around for another 
month, and I'm not dead, so hold those eulogies.  I'll be around on Genie 
for as long as I can manage to keep my personal D.CUFF account open.

     Last month, I promised a report on the status of the EDITOR.A2 
account.  It's back.  Since Ryan is going to take possession of it some 
time before Christmas, I'm continuing to sign all my articles (except the 
editorial) with my D.CUFF E-mail address/account name.  If you want to 
write to me personally, use that address.  If you want to write to the 
editor of GenieLamp A2, keep using the EDITOR.A2 address.  That way it'll 
always get to the right place.

ENABLING THE PROGRAMMER CDAs   I just read your article "The Treasure Hunt" 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   (at least I believe it was yours) in the 
September GenieLamp A2.  Very good article and it gave me some downloading 
ideas.  However, I have a question on one of yor remarks.  After the 
section on RemoveAltDisplayMode you said:

     "(While you're cleaning up the Classic Desk Accessory menu, don't 
forget to use the SetStart CDev to disable the programmer CDAs, Memory 
Peeker and Visit Monitor.  They're just confusing to new Apple IIers.)"

     My question is:  How do you get SetStart to enable them on startup?

     I have an Apple IIgs with ROM3 and 8 Meg of RAM using System 6.0.1.   
I don't know what else is pertinent.

     Thanks.

||))    ||
||))(())||))   R.Sanders19

          I'm glad you enjoyed my "Treasure Hunt" column in the September 
          issue!  To answer your question:

          You begin by making sure that your System:Desk.Accs: folder has 
          the ControlPanel NDA in it, and that your System:CDEVs: folder 
          has the SetStart CDEV in it.  If not, install 'em and reboot.

          From there, it's simple.  Simple run any desktop program, such 
          as the Finder, pull down the Apple menu and select Control 
          Panels.  Find and select the SetStart option.  (Remember, 
          pressing S will get you to the right area fast.)  Once you've 
          click on the SetStart icon, you should see something like this:

               Start up with: [ Finder __________ ]

                    [_] Show startup icons
                    [_] Enable programmer CDAs

          Just click on the box next to "Enable programmer CDAs" so that 
          an X shows there, and you're done.  Next time you reboot, the 
          CDAs will be in the menu.  Just press Apple-Control-Escape, as 
          always, to use them.


OPERATION LAMBDA "MISLEADING"   Last month's TREASURE HUNT column contained 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   this paragraph:

          "Operation Lambda by Bret 'Slixter' Victor is an all-new, 
     original game for the Apple IIgs.  As the documentation stresses, 
     'It is not a port or conversion.'  If this demonstration version 
     is anything to go by, Operation Lambda is a clear winner!"

     Not to put a damper Bret's Operation Lambda game, but statements like 
"all-new, original game" is stretching things.  I must point out Bret 
Victor's choice of words:  "It is not a port or conversion" to be a very 
misleading claim, somewhat false even.

     id Software's John Carmack and John Romero wrote a PC game years back 
called Rescue Rover.  As some may recall, "Burger" Bill Heineman ported the 
game to the Apple IIgs for Softdisk G-S.  If you've played this game, 
you'll find many concepts and ideas borrowed in Lambda.  Operation Lambda 
_is_ a variation of R.R., in both you move about mirror pieces to deflect 
lasers, and the goal is to rescue a "hostage" and exit the level.  Granted 
there are differences (rescue a hostage dog rather than multiple humans, 
your in a robot factory instead of a space-station, etc) but it is unfair 
to claim Lambda as a freshly created idea.

     By the same token, I was disappointed when Bret failed to mention 
that his last game, PuyoPuyo, was not his own game concept either.  Nowhere 
in his documention does it mention PuyoPuyo was a direct port, nor the fact 
that he "borrowed" the graphics, music and sound-effects directly from the 
Macintosh freeware version.  I know a number of people who thought Puyo was 
his creation due to a failing to mention it was a port.  I would, however, 
like to stress these programming efforts are HIGHLY appreciated and 
enjoyed, but I get a little disgruntled when someone takes credit for 
another person's ideas or creations.  It's simply a matter of being honest.

APPLE II BBS SOFTWARE   I, too, ran a Prime BBS for a few years.  Let's 
"""""""""""""""""""""   Talk also.  Your GenieLamp reminiscing gave me a 
smile.  My GBBS board is just about up to 12,000 calls.  Sadly it will 
likely go down in June as my elementary school has decided to close my GS 
lab in favor of a few pc's in each classroom.

          Ah, yes, the Let's Talk bulletin board system.  I remember that 
          one too, though I never actually ran it.  Thanks for the 
          memories.

          I'd also like to acknowledge letters this month from Mike 
          Wallace (M.WALLACE15) and Donald Lee (leed@sfsu.edu).  Thanks, 
          folks!

DESKWRITER INTERNAL FONTS   Udo,
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
     Once again, let me clarify this.  The DeskWriters, at least in my 
experience, DO have the same internal fonts built-in that the DeskJets 
have.  HOWEVER, the serial port is locked at 57.6K, which very few ProDOS 8 
programs (well, none that I know of) support for printing.  THAT is the 
reason the DeskWriter does not appear to work from ProDOS 8.  If you can 
get the program to drive the serial port at 57.6K, you're all set!

     (Please don't take this as any sort of personal attack towards you 
Udo.  This myth is so widespread that I've just had to restate the above 
many times and it does get tiresome.  I'm just trying to be as clear as 
possible so the correct information starts getting spread instead.)

     The other alternative is to use the DeskWriter over AppleTalk (then 
you could print to slot 7), but the Apple Net Printer control panel and 
8-bit Chooser only recognize Apple printers.  I believe this can be fixed, 
but I haven't had time to do it yet.  Maybe once Facelift is out, since I 
am personally quite interested in getting a DeskWriter working over AT from 
a IIgs.
                  (M.HACKETT, CAT12, TOP8, MSG:90/M645;1)


HISTORY LESSON:  RETOOLING THE FACTORY   Another important reason for the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   IIGS getting killed when it did is 
that the IIGS was produced in what was arguably Apple's most modernized 
production facility...and the company badly needed manufacturing space for 
the PowerBook line, which was recently introduced.  The IIGS became a

HTML GRAMMAR CHECKERS   This looks like as good of a place as any :)
"""""""""""""""""""""
     As you all may have guessed from my recent activity here, I've been 
doing some work with HTML, home pages, and the WWW.

     There's currently a sort of "checker" for HTML, which is a WWW site 
which checks the HTML on your web page to make sure it's all legit, after 
which you can put a small icon on your page with a checkmark and HTML 2.0 
on it, which is like a HTML "seal of approval".  I first saw this on Brian 
Wells' page (nice job, btw, Brian :)

     Is there a similar type of checker for Lynx?  It's really important 
that Apple II www sites be as lynx friendly as possible.  Harold and I had 
this discussion and he thinks there's a site, but couldn't come up with a 
URL (he wants this info too, I think :)

     Any ideas, folks?

     Interex tech support can be reached at:  800-513-9744

APPLEWORKS SPELL-CHECKER "5L" BUG   I think I have stumbled on something 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   here, and quite frankly, I for the life 
of me, just do not get it.  Some history: I am starting to catagorize my 
Apple II Collection, I decided to start on paperwork.  With the intention 
of eventually putting major portions of the list into an html table for 
posting on my Apple II Information web site.  That is why I chose to just 
use the word processor instead of a data base file for this particular part 
of it, (some of you may say, why not use the database after I describe what 
lead me up to this.)  I have my file boxes (Hanging folder cardboard boxes) 
labeled 1-12 at this point and the folders A-Z within.  The stuff is in no 
particular order at this point which is why I just figured I'll make a 
quick list, save it as a TAB delimited format, import it into a database 
later and swap stuff around, alphabetize/catagorize it... I sure wish I 
started that way and then I would have had this mess.

     Here is an example what I was doing.

     I decided to spellcheck it so I could add some more words to my 
custom dictionary... and that was the end of that.

     [Cut to the end]

     I after a long mess of 'WTF!?@@@>#$%' is going on here, I said.. ok, 
it's choking on something...  Lord knows what, no disk access had happened 
yet.  I ditched the (thank god for Macros) the Box/Folder catagory and it 
worked.  To make a long story short, 5L Locked up AppleWorks.

     What a completely and utterly SILLY and stupid bug.

     I give up.  I thought I have seen it all.  This one takes the cake.

     I'm really curious, has anyone had this happen, or is my copy of 
AppleWorks screwed?  Is something causing this, I did use a fresh copy w/o 
any Timeouts installed, same thing.  That IIgs is lucky it's not in orbit.

     I'll post this on comp.sys.apple2 when I get the chance, I want to 
see if anyone has gone nuts on a spell check and never could figure it out.  
Is there anything else besides 5L out there, what that?  Why me.  Whatta 
waste.

     The moral of the story, until this is verified, Spellcheck only 
things resemble words.  Leave the cryptic nonsense out of it.  Or next 
time, use a database.

>>>>>   I wasn't going to say anything here (wrt: AppleWorks v3.0 - 5.1,
"""""   5L, DMA SCSI cards and lockups in the document scan function during 
spell checking), but seeing as how Bev has 'let the cat out of the bag', I 
will.

     As far as I have been able to tell, after an extensive amount of 
trying different things, the lockup only occurs on IIgs machines, and only 
when a RamFast SCSI card is installed... and it does not seem to matter if 
any volume that is attached to the RamFast has been accessed or not.

     I have gone thru the RamFast's firmware (which is what P8 uses) with 
a -fine tooth- comb, and while it's not written as cleanly or nicely as -I- 
would like to see it, I can find -NO- reason for the lockup in this 
firmware.  Furthermore, knowing what I know about the RamFast hardware, I 
can not find a fault in that area either.

     However, the spell checker in AppleWorks (incl the document scan 
function, which is where the lockup occurs) has not received any serious 
(any at all???) upgrading / updates since version 3.0 per some old posts in 
A2 by Randy Brandt (as I recall)

     I =strongly suspect= (but have NOT proved!) that the problem is 
really in AppleWorks itself, and most likely related to it's use of some 
6502/65C02 opcode that does not execute in quite the same manner on a 
65C816 processor.  (There are several of these, the majority revolve around 
whether or not they wrap on page or bank boundaries.  This kind of thing 
-could- cause the processor to inadvertently 'bump' some addresses in the 
I/O space, and if one of those addresses happens to be the one that 
triggers a DMA cycle on a RamFast, well a lockup could well occur)

     I do not have access to source code for this portion of AppleWorks, 
and simply do not have time to disassemble this portion of the application 
myself.  If someone else who is =very fluent and skilled= in Apple II assy 
programming is able to pick up the ball from here, well, you'd likely wind 
up with a lot of kudos if you could nail down and fix this problem.

     Again, as I had privately agreed with Beverly Cadieux to keep my 
efforts under wraps (as she approached me privately about this matter, and 
requested discression in-advance) I would not normally be noting any of it 
here and now.  But as it has been officially revealed by Bev what the 
problem centers on, and that I've been trying to track it down (see msg 
#261 this topic), I feel at this point it is not only proper, but mandatory 
that I make full disclosure of things, and request the assistance of other 
programming types in solving this riddle.

     Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I've been really down on

flately -ignored- all of 'em. . . and I know that something is making its 
way to their mailbox and the mailbox is being checked regularly--gotta love

     So, if the promised update (I was told 5 months ago that it was being

EGO SYSTEMS CUTS BACK A BIT   October 1, 1996 - For Immediate Release
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     EGO Systems Announces New Hours, Disconnects Toll-Free Order Line

     As many of you are no doubt aware, the Apple II and IIGS market is 
still shrinking.  As a result of that shrinkage, I've been forced to make 
some hard decisions about EGO Systems and its future as an Apple II vendor.  
But first, here's a quick summary of why I'm making this announcement 
today.

     For the past 7 years, the support of the Apple II/IIGS and Macintosh 
has been my full-time job.  However, business has gotten so bad over the 
last few months that I've been forced to take part-time employment to pay 
my share of the bills here at the old EGO Systems homestead.  Sadly, that 
part-time employment is rapidly becoming my main source of income.

     Clearly, the time has come to make some tough decisions.  Here they 
are:

     o - First and foremost, EGO Systems is NOT (I repeat NOT) going out 
         of business!  So if anyone tells you that we are (or have), smack 
         them.  I'll continue to offer Apple II/IIGS, Mac and Newton 
         hardware and software for as long as I possibly can.

     o - EGO Systems will no longer accept purchase orders or invoices.

     o - Effective immediately (the end of the October 1, 1996 business 
         day), the toll-free order line will no longer be in service.  I 
         REALLY did not want to do this, but, over the last few months, the 
         toll-free line has become a HUGE money drain.  (More folks were 
         using the toll-free line for questions [usually about products 
         from other companies] than for actual orders.)  By disconnecting 
         the toll-free line, I hope to save about $1,200 a year, which 
         should allow me to stay in business for quite a while longer.  
         Orders can still be placed via our voice phone line 
         (423-843-1775), our Fax line (423-843-0661) or via e-mail 
         (diz@chattanooga.net).

     o - Effective immediately, EGO Systems will be closed on Mondays, 
         Wednesdays and Fridays.  (This is to better accommodate my 
         part-time employment.)  EGO Systems will be open its normal hours 
         on Tuesdays and Thursdays (9 am to 5 pm Eastern Time).  Because of 
         this I strongly encourage everyone to mail, Fax or e-mail any 
         orders.  You can also call and leave a message.  I WILL call you 
         back (assuming you leave a daytime phone number), but it will be 
         on a Tuesday or Thursday!

     o - Even though EGO Systems is now open on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
         only, all orders for in stock items will still ship no later than 
         the next business day after we get the order. For example, if you 
         FAX or e-mail us an order on Monday, it WILL ship out on Tuesday 
         morning.  Or, if you FAX or e-mail us an order on Sunday, it WILL 
         ship out on Monday morning.  (The only exception to this rule is 
         that orders we receive on Saturday will ship out on Monday.  This 
         is only because the Post Office is closed on Sunday.) Orders

     o - If you haven't noticed yet, the KansasFest 1996 video is LATE.  
         This is another unfortunate side effect of my part-time 
         employment.  But, we WILL be finishing and selling the video just 
         as soon as possible.  The good news here is that the KansasFest 
         1996 video will be LONG, at least three hours worth of stuff... 
         maybe more!

         check to see if the toll-free number is listed on your page.  If 
         it is, please remove the toll-free number (but keep the link to 
         our page!).

     These last few points do not really have anything to do with any of 
the above, but since I was doing a press release anyway, it seemed like a 
good time to announce them...

     o - Sales tax in our part of Tennessee has gone up another half-cent. 
          So if you live in Tennessee and place an order with us, be sure 
         to include 8.25% sales tax.

     o - Due to the high cost of CD-R disks, I'm having to raise the 
         prices of the Script Central and Studio City/Stack Central 
         CD-ROM's.  Effective immediately the new prices are:

          Script Central CD-ROM:  $89.95
          Studio City/Stack Central CD-ROM:  $109.95
          Bundle Price: $180  (Save $19.90)

     Well, that's it.  I really didn't want to have to make ANY of these

shut down completely and take a full-time job for "da man." :-)

     Thanks again for all your support over the past 7 years.  Hopefully, 
with these changes in place I can keep supporting the Apple II for seven 
more years!

GSAUG VIDEOTAPE FEATURES RARITIES   To elaborate a little bit on Matt 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Pearce's posting...

     In mid-June, 1996, the GravenStein Apple User Group hosted a 
demonstration of the Mark Twain IIGS (aka, the ROM4) prototype computer.  
The event was captured on videotape, and that 96 minute VHS video is now 
available _only_ from the GravenStein Apple User Group.  It's available in 
both NTSC and PAL format.

     The video is hosted by Joe Kohn, the Vice President of GravenStein 
and the Publisher of Shareware Solutions II.

     Since the video is about a computer that doesn't officially exist, it 
seemed appropriate at the time to use that non-existant computer to show 
off some non-existant IIGS software...such as Brutal Deluxe's System 6.0.2 
and Wolfenstein 3-D.

     System 6.0.2 was supplied by Brutal Deluxe and Wolf 3-D was supplied 
by the author of the program.  The Wolf 3-D Easter Eggs, of course, were 
supplied by Burger Bill Heineman.  The Mark Twain was supplied by Joe Kohn.  
Heckling was supplied by The Lovely Shiva ;-)

     In many ways, the video parallels the article about the Mark Twain 
that appeared in Shareware Solutions II.  Actually, I think you can say 
that the article served as an informal script for the video.

     GravenStein Apple User Group is a large Northern California user 
group, and all proceeds from the sales of the video will benefit 
GravenStein's ailing treasury.

     The tape is available for $20 if sent to a US address, or $25 for 
international orders.

     Please specify if you want the video in NTSC (US) or PAL (European) 
format.

<<<<<   Brutal Deluxe lost the System 6.0.2 source code when their hard
"""""   drive crashed.  So, sad as it is to say, the demo of System 6.0.2 
found on the Mark Twain demo tape will be the closest the Apple IIGS world 
will ever get to seeing System 6.0.2.

...AND THE FUTURE:  LemminGS   Ohmigosh!

     I have just seen the future of Apple IIGS gaming, and I'm completely 
blown away!

     "Brutal Deluxe's LemminGS" has just recently entered beta-test phase, 
and although there's still some work that needs to be done on the game, the 
latest version is simply incredible.  Heck...it's more than just "simply 
incredible"...it's fabulous, it's wonderful, it's a work of art, it's one 
of the best GS games I've ever had the pleasure of playing!!

     I have a feeling that a lot of you are going to have some late nights 
soon, basking in the glow of the phosphor LemminGS.  In fact, I think the 
beta test team is already complaining that they're now getting even less 
sleep than they did at Kfest.

     Tony Morales emailed this to me and asked me to post it on Genie.  We 
will sorely miss his talents!

     Dear Apple II User,

          I regret to inform you that effective October 1, 1996, I 
     will no longer be developing Apple II software.  This decision 
     was not made overnight. As college, and life in general, began to 
     consume more and more of my spare time, it became increasingly 
     difficult to write new code.  I intend to continue using my Apple 
     IIgs for many things, just not software development.

          As a final software contribution to the Apple II community, 
     I have decided to release the source code to a number of Apple II 
     programs I have written. It is my hope that some upcoming Apple 
     II enthusiast will find this code valuable in creating software 
     for this great machine. You can download any of this source code 
     from my WWW site at, http://www.best.com/~hexman.

          I would like to take a minute to thank everyone who has 
     contacted me with comments and/or suggestions regarding my 
     software.  Your support has been greatly appreciated.  Feel free 
     to keep in touch.  You can E-mail me at, hexman@best.com.

          For those who might be interested, I will continue to write 
     software for other computer platforms as I pursue my goal of 
     earning a BA in Computer Science.  I will update and maintain my 
     home page, including all existing Apple II areas.  This is how I 
     plan to offer support to the users of the one computer that 
     started it all for me.

          The Apple II definitely has a few years left in it.  I hope 
     all II users can find a way to work together with one another, to 
     make the II an even better machine.

                         """"""""""""""""""""""""

     This month, we present a special logic puzzle for A2 RoundTable 
users.  Any resemblance to any person, whether living or dead, is entirely 
coincidental.  Well, mostly.

     There are five houses, each of a different color and inhabited by 
five people who have special hardware, who subscribe to different 
magazines, and who call different telecommunications providers.

     1.  Pat lives in the yellow house.

     2.  Sarah calls Prodigy.

     3.  The 28.8 modem is used in the blue house.

     4.  Dave uses a SecondSight video card.

     5.  The blue house is immediately to the right (your right) of the 
         green house.

     6.  The GenieLamp A2 reader calls Delphi.  (Incredible as that 
         sounds.  Hmm, this person must have picked up their copy somewhere 
         on the Internet.)

     7.  Juiced.GS is read in the brown house.

     8.  The laser printer user lives in the middle house.

     9.  Cindy lives in the first house on the left.

     10.  The Shareware Solutions II subscriber lives in the house next to 
          the person who calls CompuServe.

     11.  Juiced.GS is read in the house next to the house where the 
          America Online caller lives.

     12.  The Apple Blossom reader uses an Floptical drive.

     13.  Hugh subscribes to The AppleWorks Gazette.

     14.  Cindy lives next to the red house.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Now, on the basis of what you've been told above:

          o  Who owns the CD-ROM?

          o  And who calls Genie?

     You'll find the answers in this month's edition, just after the LOG 
OFF column.  We know you don't usually read that section, so we thought 
that would be the safest.

FROM THE AUTHOR   Sorry is a word guessing game.  A word or phrase is 
"""""""""""""""   displayed on the screen as a series of underlines.  Each 
underline represents a letter, and spaces between them indicate separate 
words.  You will guess letters one at a time until you solve the puzzle or 
you lose the game.  There is no difference between consonants and vowels, 
so guessing vowels first is a good way to get started.

     There are two modes of play, a one player game and a two player game. 
 During a one player game you will try and solve the puzzle without 
mis-guessing more than four times.  Each time you guess incorrectly, you 
will spell a letter in "SORRY".  When you spell the whole word, the game is 
over.  A game is made up of five rounds of play.  If you make it through 
all five rounds then you win the game and are awarded bonus points.

     During a two player game, players will alternate turns.  Each player 
will continue to guess until they are wrong, then control passes to their 
opponent.  When you start a two player game you are asked if you want to 
play to a predetermined score which is set at 1,000 points.  If not, you 
have the option to enter a new score to play to.  A two player game is over 
once a puzzle is solved and one of the players has a score equal to or 
greater than the number of points entered before the game started.

     Scoring is based on how many correct guesses you can get in a row.  
Each subsequent correct guess is worth ten more points than the previous 
value.  In other words, your first correct guess is worth 10 points, your 
second is worth 20, your third is worth 30, etc.  The better you do the 
higher your score will be.  After a one player game, you have the 
opportunity to make the high scores list, if your score is good enough.  
During a two player game, the winner is displayed and scores are not added 
to the high scores list.

Word Lists   The words are arranged in word lists called databases.  You 
''''''''''   are allowed nine different word databases at one time.  These 
databases are maintained through a maintenance program that you can access 
with option 6 on the menu.  This program will allow you to choose a 
database then view, add, delete or sort the words.  You can create new 
databases and delete current ones.

     To choose the active database select option 5 from the menu and you 
will be presented with a list of the current databases on the disk.  
Choosing one will make it active, meaning that all words used in the game 
will be taken from the active database.  The words chosen for a game are 
completely random.

PD_Q COMMENTS   As the author makes clear, Sorry is a word guessing game, 
"""""""""""""   similar in many respects to Hangman.  (It should not be 
confused with Sorry!, the Parker Brothers board game.)  Although the game 
is not innovative, it is fun to play, for two main reasons.

     First of these is that the implementation is top-notch.  Sound is 
well implemented used.  The menus are attractive--well designed and laid 
out, attractive fonts are used, and a good use of the limited hi-res 
colors.  Eager enthusiasts will even eventually encounter an Easter egg.  
The game has a "Softdisk" feel--and let me assure, that's meant as a 
compliment.  I've never been a big fan of the diskazine, but I think they 
know a thing or two about design.

     Unfortunately, that same "Softdisk feel" occasionally comes across in 
the user interface, which would be my one complaint about the game.  For 
example, when you're changing the word list, you press a number to select a 
list and then Escape to confirm the choice.  Fortunately, this is a small 
irritant and doesn't affect actual game play.  If Nielson ever revises the 
game, I hope he'll alter the game screen slightly to include a window for 
the round number.  Currently, you're told the round number only at the 
beginning of a round, and in the excitement of play, you may forget how 
many more rounds it will take to win.  Again, just a minor problem.

     The second reason Nielson's Sorry is worth a look is that it comes 
with 900 words and phrases for you to guess (spread across six categories).  
That will make it fun to play without constant repetition.  You can make 
the word lists last even longer simply by toggling the option to reveal the 
solution if you don't win.  Finally, there's a sensible program to let you 
add to the existing word lists, or create your own word lists.  Data is 
under-appreciated--having lots of it on hand makes for better games, here.

     I'm delighted to report that Sorry will run on any Apple II.  There 
simply isn't much 8-bit software being developed these days, so it's great 
when a slick production like this one comes along.

SUMMING UP   The implementation of Sorry is an absolute delight.  The only 
""""""""""   reason it doesn't earn the top rating is because the game 
itself could either be considered old hat or an old favorite.  I recommend 
you download it yourself and give it a try.  You won't regret it.

1996, when the DigiPub RoundTable was closed.  DigiPub was the repository 
for all GenieLamp back issues.

     In September, with the help of the A2 RoundTable library staff, I 
managed to ensure that the 52 back issues were not lost by transferring 
them to the A2 Library.  The back issues, running from April 1992 to July 
1996, are available in two editions:

          o  a text file packed with ShrinkIt; and
          o  a text file _with linefeeds_, unpacked.

The latter edition should be of most interest to readers who no longer use 
an Apple II and therefore can't run ShrinkIt on their computers.

     Back issues since April 1994 are also available in AppleWorks word 
processor format.  Back issues since March 1996 are available in HyperCard 
and HyperStudio stack formats.  These files have been in the A2 RoundTable 
library for some time now, and are not new arrivals.

     Here's a chart to help you find the back issues in their new home:

     This feature lists the ten most popular files for the month.  To give 
files a chance to seek their own levels, no files will be added to the list 
until they've been in place at least a month.  This month, we look at the 
files uploaded 1-30 September 1996.

     This isn't the Academy Awards ceremony, folks; it's more like the 
People's Choice Awards (both of which are trademarked, by the way).  The 
Top 10 doesn't necessarily tell you what's new and interesting--what files 
_you_ might find interesting--it simply tells you what files have been 
downloaded a lot--what other people found interesting!

     This month, GenieLamp A2 occupies four spots on the list, but we're 
just counting that one file.  We hope this explains why there are 13 files 
on the Top 10 list.

        [P.BRICKELL]



                  >>> PART 3a:  MEASURING TEMPERATURE <<<
                  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     In this installment, we will be looking at the basics of measuring 
temperature with the Apple II.  Apple IIc owners will be pleased to know 
that this interfacing technique will work with their computers.

     The approach to temperature measurements that I will describe is 
based on the Apple paddle line inputs of the game port.  These can be 
checked in a limited way from BASIC, with the PDL() command or more 
accurately with a machine language routine.  A basic understanding of the 
Apple paddle circuits is needed before we can use them for our own 
purposes.  More information on the paddles can be found in the "Apple II 
Reference Manual" or "Chaos in the Laboratory" (see references at the end 
of this article). 

     The paddles themselves control variable resistors inside the paddle 
or joystick.  These variable resistors are also called potentiometers or 
just "pots" for short.  One side of the pot is connected to the Apple's +5V 
line, and the other side of the pot is connected to the PDL line 
corresponding to the particular paddle in use.  For joystick users, the two 
paddle potentiometers are connected to the stick in such a manner that one 
paddle senses the "vertical" position of the stick and one senses the 
"horizontal" position of the stick.  Otherwise the paddles and joystick are 
identical in the way they function.

     Monitoring the position of a paddle is done by determining the 
resistance of the pot at any given moment.  The pot's resistance changes as 
the paddle or joystick is moved.  Put another way, the resistance of the 
pot tells the Apple what the position of the paddle or joystick is.  When 
you use the BASIC statement X = PDL(0), X will contain a value between 0 
and 255 which is proportional to the resistance of that paddle's pot (at 
the moment the command is executed). 

     What follows is a simplified description of how the paddle circuits 
work to produce this resistance measurement.  It is not essential to know 
this in order to build a temperature measuring device for the Apple, but I 
would be remiss if I didn't provide some underlying theory.

     The PDL connections on the game port (pin 6, 10, 7, 11 on the 16 pin 
game I/O connector for PDL 0, 1, 2,3 respectively) are connected to the 
positive terminal of a capacitor and to a voltage sensing circuit inside 
the Apple (see diagram below).  The other side of the capacitor and the 
sensing circuit are grounded.

     The paddle measuring process begins when the Apple's sensing circuit 
discharges the capacitor to ground.  Once this is complete, the Apple 
starts a timing/counting sequence.  At the same time, current flows from 
the +5V line, through the variable resistor and into the discharged 
capacitor (cap).  The cap begins to store the current entering it and the 
voltage across it begins to rise.  This also causes the voltage at the 
input to the sensing circuit to rise.  Eventually, the voltage reaches a 
specified level (3.3V) which triggers the sensing circuit.  This stops the 
Apple's timing sequence. This whole process is repeated each time the 
paddle routine is accessed, either from BASIC or from machine language.

     The amount of time it takes for the capacitor to charge up to the 
trigger voltage is determined by the amount of resistance presented by the 
variable resistor.  That is, the higher the resistance setting, the slower 
the cap charges, and the longer it takes for the voltage to reach the 
trigger level.  In this case, the Apple's timing routine reaches a high 
count.  The lower the resistance in the paddle circuit, the faster the cap 
charges, and a shorter time passes before the cap charges to the trigger 
voltage.  The Apple's timing routine will produce a lower count in this 
case.

     The built-in paddle monitoring routines in the Apple produce a number 
between 0 and 255 which is proportional to the timing count.  From the last 
paragraph, you can see that this is also proportional to the resistance of 
the paddle circuit (as determined by the setting of the paddle's pot).  
What we now have is a way of measuring electrical resistance in a circuit 
connected between the paddle and +5V lines of the Apple's game port.

     Now, suppose we substitute a special temperature sensitive resistor 
for the mechanically variable one inside the joystick or paddle.  This 
resistor will change its resistance value as its ambient temperature 
changes.  We now have a way, although an indirect one, of measuring 
temperature by reading the value returned by the paddle routines in the 
Apple.  This is the idea behind the method of measuring temperature with 
the Apple which I will be describing.  

     The specialized resistor is called a thermistor, and its resistance 
decreases as its temperature increases.  They are widely available in 
surplus houses and electronic suppliers (or Radio Shack) at prices which 
range from a few cents to a few dollars.   The inexpensive ones are plain 
beads of thermistor material on the end of two wire leads.  The more 
expensive versions are enclosed in some sort of protective material (often 
glass) which allows them to be used for measuring the temperature of 
corrosive chemical solutions or for use in other hostile environments. 

     Before you run out to buy a thermistor to stick in your game port, I 
have to break it to you that it is not quite that simple.  There are two 
practical problems which must be overcome before we can use a thermistor as 
a practical temperature measuring peripheral for the Apple.

     The first is that the PDL routines in the Apple can only produce one 
of 256 possible values.  This will be sufficient for crude temperature 
measurements but will not provide enough accuracy for most temperature 
measuring situations.  The solution to this problem is to increase the 
counting time which the Apple uses to measure the paddle circuit's 
resistance.  This requires a machine language routine of some sort to 
replace the built-in routine used by BASIC (and the monitor).  

     For the experienced machine language programmer, this will not be too 
much of a problem.  For the rest of us,  a suitable program can be found on 
the disk which accompanies Vernier's "Chaos in the Laboratory" workbook.  
Incidentally, with this book you also get a detailed description of the 
thermistor temperature probe project and 13 other Apple II interfacing 
projects.

     A way of producing a longer charging time is needed for the 
voltage-sensing circuit so that it will not trigger before a reasonable 
number of counts has been reached.  This is accomplished by adding a large 
capacitor to the paddle circuit,  which augments the capacitance of the one 
inside the Apple.  It is also important to pick a thermistor of suitably 
high resistance to allow the capacitors to charge sufficiently slowly.  
These hardware additions form the core of a practical thermistor circuit.

     A final complication that arises when using a thermistor as a 
temperature probe is that its resistance does not change in a linear 
fashion with temperature.  In other words, a 10% change in temperature does 
not result in a 10% change in thermistor resistance.  The relationship 
between temperature and resistance is quite complicated, as is the math 
required to accurately calculate one from the other.  It is possible to 
make some simple approximations based upon trial and error, but for more 
demanding applications a proper calibration program is necessary.  Again, a 
suitable program can be found on the "Chaos" disk from Vernier.  More 
adventurous programmers may want to consider writing their own calibration 
programs.

     I will conclude with a few comments about the use of the paddle 
circuits for interfacing in general.  It should be clear by now that these 
circuits can be used for measuring output from almost any device which 
varies its electrical resistance in response to some external quantity.  
There are sensors which do this in response to changing light or infrared 
radiation levels, pressure, humidity and other parameters.  Many of these 
sensors should be adaptable to the Apple's paddle inputs once you 
understand how they respond to change.

     Next month I will discuss some of the details of building and using a 
thermistor circuit as an Apple II temperature probe.

FURTHER READING   You will have noticed by now that I frequently refer to 
"""""""""""""""   the two Vernier books.  These are the books  which 
started me into computer interfacing and electronics in general.  I found 
them well written and easy to follow.  They both include useful and well 
documented software for each project.  In addition, their projects use only 
the Apple II game port, so no computer modifications are required.  

     I cannot recommend these books highly enough for anyone who wants to 
explore Apple II interfacing (just so you know--I have no affiliation with 
Vernier Software).  I will be referencing them frequently for the 
interfacing projects that I will be describing in the following months.  If 
you are seriously considering experimenting with any of these projects, it 
would be well worth your while to acquire one or both of them.  Each of 
them is a self contained manual, but describes a different set of projects.

     I purchased my copies several years ago from Resource Central when 
they were still in business.  I believe they can still be purchased 
directly from Vernier Software.  If you are interested, drop a line to 
David Vernier at  dvernier@vernier.com or visit http://www.vernier.com for 
current pricing and availability.  As far as I know they are still both in 
print.  

     I think it is possible to occasionally get photocopies of some Apple 
II manuals directly from Apple (at least I did from Apple Canada recently).  
This may be worth a try if you don't already have a copy of the Apple II 
Reference.  It is also worth dropping by in Cat 4, Topic 27 in the A2 
RoundTable on Genie.  I have occasionally seen them for sale there (used).

     There have been many other books written on microcomputer 
interfacing.  Some are Apple II orientated, but many are either more 
general in nature or refer specifically to other computer platforms.  A 
trip to the local library may be useful.  A browse through back issues of 
computer magazines such as _Byte_ will certainly turn up some useful 
references and projects.

     John Peters began by creating freeware online magazines for the Atari 
community--first TeleTalk OnLine, which started on Denver BBSes and moved 
national, then 3 issues of PD_Quickview, and finally, 1990, GEnie Lamp, 
which focused on the ST RoundTable exclusively.

     In February 1992, GEnie allowed John to expand the concept to other 
computing RoundTables.  The "first four" were GEnieLamp ST, A2, Mac, and 
IBM.  Over the years, the GEnieLamp roster boasted at least 10 
editions--GEnieLamp IBM (and GEnieLamp IBM MM), GEnieLamp Mac, GEnieLamp 
MacPRO, GEnieLamp ST (and GEnieLamp TX2), GEnieLamp A2, GEnieLamp A2Pro, 
GEnieLamp Windows, GEnieLamp PPC, GEnieLamp Elsewhere and a weekly 
GEnieLamp {PR}.

     Slowly, editions of GEnieLamp began to disappear.  GEnieLamp MacPRO 
was an early casualty, closing after just 3 issues in February 1993.  The 
weekly GEnieLamp {PR}--press releases and classified ads from the Atari 
RoundTable--finished with its 74th issue in August 1994.

     In late 1995, issues began to appear less regularly as payment for 
contributors dried up.  The first edition to go was GEnieLamp Windows, last 
published in September 1995.  The IBM MM (MultiMedia) edition and GEnieLamp 
PowerPC stopped in December 1995.  In January 1996, GEnieLamp A2Pro 
published its last issue.

     In February 1996, GEnie was sold to Yovelle, and they stopped all 
credit-hours, which meant that GEnieLamp (now GenieLamp) no longer had a 
way to pay contributors.  The next month, GEnieLamp ST--the flagship 
issue--and GEnieLamp TX2 (the Atari version in a special graphic format) 
stopped with their March 1996 issues.  GenieLamp IBM and Mac published a 
June 1996, as did GenieLamp A2.  IBM and Mac were working on their July 
issues when the word came--DigiPub was to be closed, and the editor's 
accounts taken away.  Most editor's accounts were surrected at the last 
moment, but the damage was done.

     Only GenieLamp A2 soldiered on, and produced what was supposed to be 
the final issue.  Even after the closure of DigiPub, GenieLamp A2 continued 
to be produced, and continues now--the last of the GenieLamps in the 
original, classic form.

                                 [*][*][*]


     GenieLamp A2 began in April 1992 when John Peters took his Atari 
magazine and brought it to three more platforms--IBM, Macintosh, and Apple 
II.  At first, it was known as GEnie Lamp Apple ][ (note the space), and 
its first editor was Tom Schmitz, though he was listed as co-editor for the 
first two issues.  Contributors to that first issue were Larry Faust Lorne 
"Rainy" Wilson, and the big story was the release of IIgs System Software 
v6.0.  Tom's title was changed to editor with issue #3, and Phil Shapiro 
became co-editor.

     By the fourth issue, the name had changed to GEnie Lamp A2/A2Pro.  
That was a special issue since it was combined with parts of the third 
issue and was brought out in HyperStudio stack format to help celebrate 
KansasFest.  Surprisingly, it would be the last hyper-issue for over three 
years.

     The space was dropped from the name--now GEnieLamp A2/A2Pro--with the 
seventh issue (October 1992).  That was also Tom Schmitz's last issue.  
Darrel Raines took over with the November 1992 issue, still assisted by 
Phil Shapiro.

     GEnieLamp A2Pro got its own separate issue in January 1993.  
GEnieLamp publisher John Peters tried out the concept of the "mini issue" 
in March and April 1993, which left out all the multi-platform material... 
and the humor, puzzles, and ASCII cartoons.  That was about the time that 
the A2 RoundTable gave away a slew of prizes to the person who uploaded the 
library's 20,000th file.  The next month, May 1993, John Peters tried 
running two issues a month--one on the first of the month and one on the 
fifteenth--but the experiment wasn't a success.  In fact, some issues fell 
behind, GEnieLamp A2 included.  There was no time to produce a June 1993 
issue.

     John Peters did a large part of the editorial work on the July 1993 
issue, which took time that he couldn't really afford, so he and Dean Esmay 
went looking for a new editor.  They chose Doug Cuff, who made his bow in 
the August 1993 issue.  Cuff's second issue was the biggest ever--250K--but 
he soon calmed down a lot.

     With the October 1993 issue, the focus shifted.  Instead of each 
editor having to submit his material to publisher Peters for the final 
assembly, each editor became responsible for every step required to put 
together the magazine.  That was the same month we reported on shareware 
author Karl Bunker saying goodbye, and AppleWorks 4.0 saying hello.

     GEnieLamp A2 began producing a new edition with the April 1994 
issue--an AppleWorks word processor file.  Up until then, there has been 
three editions:  a text file packed with ShrinkIt for the power users, a 
text file not packed with ShrinkIt for those who didn't have ShrinkIt, and 
a text file, not packed, with added linefeeds for those didn't have an 
Apple II but wanted to read GEnieLamp A2 anyway.  The AppleWorks edition 
was available in the A2 Library only; the others were found in the DigiPub 
RoundTable.

     Almost two years later, in March 1996, GenieLamp A2 (as it became 
when General Electric sold GEnie to Yovelle and it became "Genie") 
introduced two more editions--a HyperCard stack from Josh Calvin and a 
prototype HyperStudio stack from editor Doug Cuff.  These too were 
available exclusively in the A2 Library.

     When Yovelle began closing down the less profitable RoundTables in 
June and July 1996, DigiPub was one of those slated for closure.  Since the 
July 1996 issue, all editions of GenieLamp A2 have been uploaded to the A2 
RoundTable library--and the back issues have since been moved there as 
well.

     In 1997, GenieLamp A2 gets a new editor--Ryan Suenaga.  We'll let him 
write the new few chapters in the history of GenieLamp A2.
