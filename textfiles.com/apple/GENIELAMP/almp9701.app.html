                         >>> GOODBYE AND HELLO <<<
                             """""""""""""""""

     I often wonder what it was like for Royce Clayton to start at
shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals instead of Ozzie Smith, or how Steve
Young felt when he took the reins of the San Francisco 49ers from Joe
Montana.

     In any case, with this issue, I take the torch from an all-time great
as well: Doug Cuff has stepped down as the editor of _GenieLamp A2_.  Doug
is now the former editor of three Apple II publications, _A2-Central_, _II
Alive_, and _GenieLamp A2_.  Like other all-time greats, he deserves a
standing ovation.

     I cannot express just how much Doug's writing means to me.  You see, I
live in Hawai'i, separated from the rest of the computing world by a body
of water in reality, and an ocean of misunderstanding in philosophy, and
sometimes it's awfully lonely out here.

     The few Apple II publications that are still publishing remain a
source of both interest and inspiration.  And nothing in the Apple II world
has ever been as much like clockwork as Doug Cuff's GenieLamp A2, coming
out on the first of each month with only rare exception.

     Doug hasn't left GenieLamp; he's still here as a contributing writer.
Enjoy your new role, Doug.  You've earned my admiration, gratitude, and
respect, as well as that of many others.  Because of your work, I will
always remember, "On a clear day, you can still see forever."

     Like Clayton and Young, who went on to quickly help their teams to
championships, I intend to continue GenieLamp's winning tradition.  This is
not to say that my feet are big enough to fill Doug's shoes, just that I
will give all I can to maintain his level of excellence.  It's a tough job,
and it's mine now.

     Welcome to a new beginning.

                                 [*][*][*]


     In one of the first interviews I did for the _Talking II_ series in
Steve Cavanaugh's publication, _The Apple Blossom_, I chided Eric Shepherd
(a.k.a. Sheppy, the Logicware guy behind _Wolfenstein 3D_ for the IIgs)
about the number of email addresses he had (I believe at the time it was
four).  Now, in a twist that only a fatalist could fully appreciate, I find
myself in a quandary due to an overabundance of email addresses.

     For reasons not totally understood (at least, I don't understand it),
instead of transferring the EDITOR.A2 account to me, Genie chose to open up
a new account for the editor of this periodical.  Henceforth, mail meant
for the editor of _GenieLamp A2_ ought to be sent to A2LAMP
(a2lamp@genie.com for those of you who do mail from other services).  Mail
sent to the older EDITOR.A2 address still ought to be received, although
how long that will be true is unknown at this point.

     Those of you who want to contact Doug Cuff, the past editor of
_GenieLamp A2_, will want to send email to D.CUFF.  Those of you who want
to contact me personally ought to really send mail to my
rsuenaga@kestrok.com email address; failing that, R.SUENAGA1 or A2LAMP or,
I guess, EDITOR.A2 will work as well.

     If you're not confused enough yet, you also have the option of
reaching me at rsuenaga@delphi.com, but my rsuenaga@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu
account is now officially closed.  And if you want to reach me during the
work day, you can even try ryan.suenaga@kp.org.

     I have just two words for anyone who believes computers simplify our
lives: They lied.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Preparing for this first issue was tough enough without my considering
how I'd introduce myself to all of you.  I tried a few times to write a
paragraph or two about myself (and my Apple IIs), but I wasn't able to come
up with anything that didn't read as corny, flakey, or just plain bizarre.
So, instead, I turned to one of the Apple II world's most infamous writers,
Tim Kellers, with an unusual request: interview me.

     I guess I _could_ have tried to interview myself, ala Guy Kawasaki a
few months back, but Guy's attempt at this unusual format was delivered as
he was ending his stint as a regular _MacWorld_ columnist.  I decided that
as an _incoming_ rather than _outgoing_ editor, it might be best to
introduce as little controversy as possible, which brings up the question
of why Tim Kellers was chosen as the author.

     Hey, what can I say?  He volunteered.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Finally, a columns update:

     The File Bandwagon will reappear next month, once I get my feet back
under me.

     Humor Online is also on a brief hiatus; the holidays late in the year
apparently bring much joy, but less humor.

     And, Peter Brickell's still out there in the real world, so The Real
World Apple continues its hiatus.

BILL SHUFF AND II ALIVE   I was reading the latest GEnie A2 Lamp and was
"""""""""""""""""""""""   happy to see the postings that tell about my
ill-fated article for "II Alive" magazine.  I was both angry and very upset
when my magazine arrived and I saw what happened to my instructions.  I
would be happy to send anyone who is interested in making a TWGS cable, a
set of instructions that they can use.  I will E-mail the instructions to
anyone who requests them.  My E-mail address is bill2060@cris.com.

     If someone wants a ZIP cable and does not care to make one themselves,
I would suggest they contact Doug Pendleton.  He has a supply of my cables.
I would even be willing to convert a Zip cable obtained from him, into a
TWGS cable for a very modest charge.

GRAPHIC THOUGHTS ABOUT THE WEB   An idea just occured to me:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     Why must we absolutly, cannot live without, a graphical web browser
for the Apple IIgs?

     Couldn't we use Copilot scripting to treat the internet as (a)
seperate roundtable(s)?

     A script could be used to:

     "find & replace" the message dividers for the Copilot editor.
     "find & replace" the URLs for the Copilot scripts.
     "find & replace" the HTML tags for Copilot "special actions".
     "find & replace" the LYNX links for Copilot "special action scripts".

     Spectrum's "filters" could also be brought into use. A Spectrum Xcmd
could be used in conjunction with a HMTL translator to make Graphical Web
pages viewable (and maybe functionable?) while offline.

     I'm not all that sure how Copilot functions, but maybe the whole
operation could be processed while offline in a seperate function.

     Surf the 'web?  Naw, I'd rather cast-net, gig flounder, and beach
comb.

"""""
     I've just finished reading Max Jones' interesting interview with Derek
Taubert.  To say that it was interesting is a great understatement.  To
learn of the impressive progress made by Taubert is truly astounding!
Prior to this I had no idea (aside from rumors) that anyone actually had a
workable Web Browser running on a GS.  Not only that, but Derek also hosted
a Web Page using his software and GNO.

     That kind of news ought get our juices going, folks!

     One of the great, but rarely spoken-of advantages of the GS, is the
current super-low price of the used GS itself and the continued supply of
parts from several sources.  When compared to the cost of Macs or even
lower cost PC-clones, we've got 'em beat by miles.  Added to that, is the
friendliness of the GS and it's ready ability to adapt to so many
possibilities.  Taubert's comments are getting to sound mighty interesting.
:)

     I'm hoping that Max's interview will generate more discussion as well
as hope among those who have just about given up on a GS as a smooth web
browser.  I've used the Lynx interface from Genie, but it doesn't do a
whole lot for me; further, my local ISP doesn't "do" Lynx.  I'm guessing,
but this may be true also in most other areas?

     I have been on the fence about ordering a Mac (or clone) so as to put
up a Web Page for an enterprise that I've been contemplating for some time.
With the outlook being as good as indicated by Taubert, I think I'll just
wait and see.  I'd certainly rather spend my mullah right here in the A2/GS
community.

     I really feel that Derek oughtta hear some encouragement from the
community and perhaps Max's interview will prompt some additional comments.

     Not totally unexpected I guess, is Derek's problem concerning software
piracy.  I perceive this is a serious blockage to his progress.  What a
shame!

     If I may daydream outloud....  it surprises me that the computer
industry,  regardless of manufactur, doesn't have a scheme for embedding a
computer's serial number into it's ROM.  Perhaps there could then be some
tamper-proof way to have published software access the ROM for "signature"
comparison.  On the flip, it should be expected that when a registered
owner of a software requests a duplicate for a new or different machine or
whatever, it would be an inexpensive procedure.

is a comm program with VT-100 emulation (ANSI usually will work as well).

Usually the isp will provide the pine program for shell users to access
their mail (type "pine" at the UNIX prompt), which is a user friendly menu
driven program that is fast and easy to use.  If it does not exist, there
is a similar program called elm (accessed similarly), which isn't as nice,
but is reasonable.  As a last resort, you can type "mail" at the prompt.

MORE PUBLISH IT! AND POSTSCRIPT     Two more things to experiment with:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""     Take any of your PI screen fonts (e.g.
DESPLAINES.xx) and rename it to NORTHBROOK.xx.

Now when you print your PostScript document (either to printer or disk),
you'll get the Helvetica-Narrow font. I'm still playing with how the
spacing and sizing is handled, and was hoping for some input.

Also, renaming any font to Northbrook will get you Avantgarde.

BTW, can anyone suggest a location for 15-20 bytes of code that most
programs or ProDos will never walk on? I've already tried $300 and struck
out.

I did a few experiments and discovered that the problem...as you
suggested...was that page width needs to be 255.  (I had previously had it
set to 140.)  I admit that I did not pay attention to your statement that
extra carriage returns in the middle of a line could cause
problems--because I was _sure_ I had read in the PostScript Language
Reference Manual (the "red book") that PS ignored CR's unless preceded by
"\".  Now I checked and found thatwhat I remembered is true, BUT _only
within text strings_.  My apologies [eating my hat if I had one].

Now I took things a few steps further.  I tried printing my file (your
commands/Laserprep/Ctrl-D/modified PS file created by PI) with ProTERM set
to interpret dot commands and eject final page: it still worked!  This is
great, because I just changed my default setting to page width of 255
characters--which works fine for my other uses of PT--and kept the other
settings as they were...no need to change the set-up to print PI/PS docs.

I then wondered if I could modify your modified Laserprep file so my
printer, set to automatic "personality" switching, would recognize it as
PS, to save mehaving to change things at the control panel before and after
printing a PI/PS file.  A comment line beginning with "%" seems to do it.
My modification of your modified Laserprep begins:

% Laserprep modified to print PublishIt files from ProTERM
systemdict
serverdict begin exitserver
%%Title: "Laser Prep -- The Apple PostScript Dictionary (md)"
%%Creator: Apple Software Engineering
%%CreationDate: Thursday, March 19, 1987
%{appledict version #68 0

It worked just fine!  This leads me to wonder if you (and I do mean _you_,
because this would be way beyond my capabilities) could patch PI so we
could use it for "direct" printing (from PI itself) with printers set to
automatic switching.  I am thinking that if you could insert a line at the
beginning of the very first query (or command) the printer sends to the
printer that the printer would see as an indication the transmission is in
PS language, it might switch.  For example, if you could insert "%
comment<CR>" or "%<space><CR>", or perhaps just "%<CR>" at the beginning
would do it.

<<<<<   That is great news about your getting the PI PostScript
"""""   print-to-disk files to print sucessfully from ProTerm, without
having to fire up PI first.

Your sucess in addition to mine was critical to our efforts, as it shows
the repeatability of what we are doing. Thanks for taking the time to work
through all the 'junk' I threw at you. Don't worry about the confusion over
the mid-line CR problem. I got burned several times by those pesky errors
before I figured out that it really made a difference. Your Red Book
explanation about them being outside of text strings is in fact the cause.

I like your auto emulation switching mod to the Laserprep file. I'm getting
closer to pinning down exactly how, from where (in the code)  and when PI
sends certain pieces of the PostScript code, and will try to work in the
mod you suggested.

FWIW, I've noticed that when PI substitutes Helvetica Narrow for any screen
font that you choose to rename to Glenview, it keeps the character _width_
the same as with Helvetica, but increases the character _height_ slightly
over the Helvetica height. I'm playing with this since Margot mentioned
that many of the fonts she likes to substitute have widths narrower than
Helvetica. I'd like to figure out where and how PI gets the font width info
when doing its line length and height calculations. I suppose from the
Laserwidths file, but...

to my accelerated Apple IIGS.

I believe from comments I've seen that GUS uses a hand-coded assembly 65816

I -suspect- that you haven't snagged your ROM properly.  The docs give
instructions on how to do it, but it requires your typing be exact.

It wouldn't be that tough a task to build an EXEC file that would grab the
ROM for you, but I haven't done it yet.

And, of course, it's illegal to actually distribute the ROM sans Apple's

                                 *****

              Fast Eddie Labs releases Fast Eddie Beta 1


Fast Eddie Labs, Switzerland - 12/22/96 - Fast Eddie Labs announced today
the immediate availablity of a beta release of its Apple II emulation
software code-named "Fast Eddie". This unique software product marks a new
achievement in Apple II emulation history - Fast Eddie is the first
publicly available emulator for Macintosh computers that emulates the most
powerful Apple II computer ever, the Apple IIgs.

Fast Eddie Labs has invested a tremendous amount of development time in
order to provide the public with a reliable emulation software in 1996, the
year the Apple IIgs celebrated its 10th anniversary. This public beta is
the beginning of a series of updates that will bring you the most powerful,
most versatile and most enjoyable virtual Apple II.

Fast Eddie was started in 1994 by Andre Horstmann, a long-time Apple IIgs
programmer with special interest in CPU design, but put on ice soon after
that. During a developers' meeting in early 1996, Andre Horstmann and
Henrik Gudat agreed on resurrecting the Fast Eddie project and turning it
into a fully functional Apple IIgs emulator. Urs Hochstrasser joined the
team and added debugging tools that greatly simplified development.

Fast Eddie emulates a Apple IIgs computer with up to eight 3.5" disk
drives, up to 8Mb RAM, keyboard, joystick and mouse. Furthermore, the user
can choose between both ROM versions (ROM images not included) for maximum
compatibility. It supports all video modes (40/80 text, mixed, hires,
double hires, super hires) and a superfast memory management scheme for top
performance. Contrary to other emulators, Fast Eddie features no-compromise
Ensoniq sound emulation with mono, stereo, stereo enhanced and mind-blowing
Dolby Pro Logic surround sound. On the peripherals side, you'll be pleased
to know that you can mount up to 8 disks of several gigabytes each. One
device is reserved for the built-in disk drive that can deal with ProDOS,
HFS and MS-DOS disks without requiring you to make disk images or activate
PC Exchange.

This beta has been released due to the incredible demand for such an
emulation software. Fast Eddie protects your past investments in Apple II
software and offers you a convincing way for painless migration to the
Power Macintosh platform. Fast Eddie Labs is working on several additional
components that will be released in due time, including emulation and sound
core in PowerPC assembly language, low-level disk access, and much more.

Fast Eddie is sold as a shareware product. To simplify payment, Fast Eddie
Labs is cooperating with Kagi Shareware, a company specialized in
processing shareware fees (http://www.kagi.com). A single user license is
available for US$25. Please contact Fast Eddie Labs for site licenses and
special pricing for educational institutions.

Fast Eddie Labs is a spin-off of Bright Software, a renowned provider of
productivity, entertainment and scientific software with over a dozen
releases including the popular ShadowWrite, Hermes, The Gate (editor's
choice), SpaceFox, ShadowDial, Symbolix, MultiView II, among others. Since
1989, Bright Software has been developing unique software products for
Apple II computers, and the release of Fast Eddie gives evidence of our
commitment to the Apple II platform.

<<<<<   Fast Eddie (possibly) Frequently Asked Questions
"""""

1. Registration

  We have signed up at Kagi Shareware, a service specialized in processing
shareware fees. Kagi is collecting shareware fees for us. However, Kagi is
NOT offering any kind of customer support. All comments, suggestions and
problems concerning registration codes should directly go to Fast Eddie
Labs. In order to get the quickest possible answer, you should _always_
send your e-mails to _both_ authors, namely gudath@ubaclu.unibas.ch and
andre.horstmann@unifr.ch .


   Q: What's the difference between the unregistered and the registered
      version?
   A: The only difference is the 15 minutes limit. After working with
      Eddie for 15 minutes, the program displays a message and quits.

   Q: How do I register?
   A: The Fast Eddie archive includes a Register application. Please
      fill in the boxes, choose a method of payment and forward this
      form to Kagi Shareware. How to contact Kagi is explained in the
      Fast Eddie Read Me.
      IMPORTANT: when starting up, Fast Eddie displays a serial code.
      You should send this code along with a text copy of your order
      to gudath@ubaclu.unibas.ch _and_ andre.horstmann@unifr.ch . As
      soon as we receive a confirmation from Kagi, we will forward
      you your registration code per e-mail. Please keep this code in
      a safe place.

   Q: This is confusing. What exactly do I have to do to register?
   A: - start Eddie and write down the serial code in the shareware
        notice
      - quit Eddie
      - start the Register application
      - fill in the order form
      - save the order as a text file or in the clipboard
      - forward the order form to Kagi as explained in the Read Me.
        Keep in mind that some methods of payment can only be sent
        via snail mail and not e-mail or fax, or vice versa. The Read
        Me will tell you.
      - Upon sending Kagi the order form, send an email to
        gudath@ubaclu.unibas.ch _and_ andre.horstmann@unifr.ch with
        a) a text copy of the order you sent to Kagi
        b) your SERIAL CODE
        c) your complete snail mail and e-mail address

   Q: Funny, I registered Fast Eddie but it reverts to the
      unregistered version.
   A: Please forward your old registration code and the serial
      number printed in the shareware notice to gudath@ubaclu.unibas.ch
      _and_ andre.horstmann@unifr.ch . We will check the code and, if
      necessary, send you a new one for free.
      Please do not contact Kagi Shareware if you encounter problems
      with registration unless you have questions regarding your
      payment.

   Q: Is this fee valid for all upcoming versions of Fast Eddie?
   A: Yes.

   Q: Why should I pay a shareware fee for a *beta*?
   A: This is a good point. We believe that the current release provides
      enough functionality in order to use it as a game console or
      productivity tool.

   Q: Do you have special pricing for schools?
   A: Yes, e-mail for details


 2. Support

   Q: Are you actually interested in any kind of feedback?
   A: YES!

   Q: Could you send me a ROM image?
   A: Sorry, no. We are not allowed to distribute ROM images.

   Q: I sent you an e-mail, but got no response. You guys suck!
   A: I don;t know how much e-mails we will get, but it is probable that
      we will get more mails than we can handle.

   Q: So, I don't own a Apple IIgs and can't make a ROM dump.
   A: You are only allowed to use ROM dumps with Fast Eddie if you
      also own a "physical", non-virtual Apple IIgs.

   Q: I have a few suggestions regarding improvements. What are the
      chances that you put my suggestions on your to-do list?
   A: 99%

   Q: Do you offer on-line support?
   A: Yes and no. We expect you to read the enclosed documentation, but
      if you still have questions feel free to contact us. We are also
      monitoring comp.sys.apple2 and comp.emulators.apple2.

   Q: comp.sys.apple2? I heard this newsgroup is an alias of alt.flame.
   A: Hmm, that's correct. And we make use of FlameStation, although
      only on Eddie-users with unregistered versions. :-D


 3. Other issues

   Q: What do I need in order to run Fast Eddie?
   A: You need a Power Mac (any), 640x480 display with 256 colors,
      a ROM image (ROM 1 or 3), and Apple IIgs software.

   Q: This thing is dog-slow.
   A: Then your Mac is dog-slow. :)
      Seriously, Fast Eddie is running at 3Mhz and above with pure C
      code that is not optimized by the compiler. I don't think this is
      slow.

   Q: I don't understand. Why is it not optimized?
   A: Because the compiler goes belly up while optimizing the CPU
      emulation.

   Q: My old 601/66Mhz PowerPC is emulating faster than my supercool
      portable 603e/100 Mhz. What the hell are you doing?
   A: Some 603e systems do not have level 2 cache that greatly speeds up
      Fast Eddie. Also, 603e systems are often built on low-performance
      mamaboards. Lastly, Fast Eddie has been compiled specifically for
      601 PowerPC chips.

   Q: And when can I expect a faster version?
   A: Soon. We will add hand-crafted assembly code soon.

   Q: Hey, and what about IWM emulation?
   A: IWM emulation *is* actually mostly done (and even part of this
      beta!), but two things are missing so we have disabled it. Coming
      soon.

   Q: Iiik, and 1-bit sound, 5.25" disks and serial ports?
   A: How embarassing. It's in the pipeline, promised.

   Q: Why did you write Fast Eddie?
   A: Our GS monitors turned very fuzzy recently, making it hard to read
      Merlin-16 code.

that stuff uploaded to the Delphi libraries, although it won't happen over

I have high hopes that we will be able to upload some script packages for
at least READING Delphi messages before Christmas. With a little luck (and
the time to do it) we will have some scripts that will actually take you
through the compose/upload process as well.

CoPilot is coming. It will not be ready before Christmas (barring a
miracle:), but it is coming. Meanwhile, we'll make other, usable, options
available. Probably several of them, so you can pick and choose which one
you like best. :)

     Believe me, As the 35-year-old father of two kids (11 and 5) and a
200-mile/day commute, I can appreciate the RLI factor. And I am compelled
to say that considering the saga of CoPilot - Its age, its original author
is gone, its source code is in a trash heap, etc. - I'm amazed that CoPilot
works as beautifully as it currently does.

     That is really a testament to the incredible support by both
"official" parties and volunteers. From Spectrum & ANSIterm to the
scripters and other code slingers to the emergence of Delphi as an
alternative home, this is a vibrant example of how the Apple II is not
about chips 'n' solder, but about COMMUNITY in the fundamental sense of the
word. (can't ya just hear the music welling in the background ;)

By the time you read this, presents will have been unwrapped, and folks
will be settling down to "rest up" after the hustle and bustle of getting
ready for Christmas.

It's a good time to remember that the spirit of Christmas calls us to be a
caring, sharing people filled with love for one another. It is truly more
blessed to give than to receive.

May the spirit of Christmas remain with you and yours throughout this next
year, and be renewed each Christmas to come.

God bless us, every one!

     Operation Lifestyle by Dr. Joel S. Retholtz adapts the Canadian Heart
Association risk factor analysis scheme to administer a quiz about your
lifestyle.  It will ask you about your diet, your indulgences (smoking,
alcohol, drugs), whether you exercise, your behaviour behind the wheel of a
car, and so on.  After you finish, it will rate your lifestyle in one of
four categories:  hazardous, risky, good, or excellent.

     This DOS 3.3 disk archive uses graphic routines from the Beagle Bros
disk "Apple Mechanic" (later Shape Mechanic).  Unfortunately, it doesn't
use them to good effect:  the font used for the questions is about the same
of 40-column mode text, and the font used for the answer is larger and in
color.  Except for a short animation when reporting the results--lifted
straight from the Beagle Bros disk and largely meaningless in this
context--the program might just as well be text-based.

     This archive is a natural for updating to ProDOS.  If you'd like to
see the FILE MECHANIC show you how to handle it, write to GenieLamp A2 and
say so.  If you'd like to try this conversion yourself, you'll find the

     "The Great Ping Pong Ball Experiment" by Phil Shapiro (art by Ron
Evry) is a sort of electronic storybook about the idea of dropping a ping
pong ball at the source of the Nile to see if it will make it to Cairo.  It
was created using the Slide Shop toolkit from Scholastic Software, a
program that I had never heard of until now (despite its availability in
1991).  This kit allows for attractive screen wipes of the hi-res screen,
plus music.  The software would seem to run on any Apple II, even those
with no lower-case nor 80-column screen, and yet is aware of the Apple IIgs
and the mouse!  (It doesn't quite know how to handle a mouse and a joystick
if both are plugged in simultaneously.)

     The fanciful story by Phil Shapiro takes two disk sides to tell.
While well told--I particularly liked the occasional light touch--it takes
a little too long to get going.  The art by Ron Evry ranges from adequate
to attractive.

                File #17286:  PT.SCHEDULE.BXY (50048 bytes)
                '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     Scheduler v2.1 by Patrick M. Gormley is designed to help schedule
parent-teacher conferences.  It allows for a maximum of 64 teachers, 3
conference days, 24 appointments per day per teacher, and 18 conferences
per parent per day.  It was designed for school secretaries to use.  In
this demo, certain features of this program have been turned off until you
pay the $25 shareware fee.

     You begin by selecting up to three days of the week when teachers are
available for consultation and the times they are available.  You then
enter the names of all the teachers.  You can also choose to enter a brief
letter to parents--10 lines of about 75 characters.

     With this done, it's possible to start slotting parents into the
teachers' schedules.  You are asked for the parent's name and the student's
name.  You then get to choose a day of the week and a time.  Finally, you
choose the teacher to be consulted.

     I happen to think there's too little scheduling software for the Apple
II, and practically no _good_ scheduling software, so I was thrilled to
find Scheduler and prepared to love it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't.

     Never mind the weird coloring of the desktop interface--that's minor.
Never mind the fact that Scheduler is badly programmed--instead of checking
to see if data files exist, it hangs when it doesn't find them.  Far more
serious is how poorly Scheduler handles scheduling conflicts.

     If a parent--Colonel Mustard--is scheduled for two conferences at the
same time with two different teachers (Mr Blonde and Mr Pink), the program
doesn't warn you about the problem.  When you print out Colonel Mustard's
"parent" schedule, only the appointment with Mr Blonde is mentioned.

     If a teacher--Mr Blonde--has two parents (Colonel Mustard and Miss
Scarlett) scheduled to see him at the same time, the program is a little
better behaved, but not much.  What happens is that the second parent, Miss
Scarlett, is given the next available time slot for that day.  There's no
warning about this--it just happens.  What happens if there are no more
slots for that day?  When you print the schedules for Colonel Mustard and
Miss Scarlet, _both_ parents are told that Mr Blonde is not available.
Notice that this only happens at the printing stage--there's no warning
before you get to this stage.

     The author concludes his brief documentation with the notation:  "This
is a good program, it saved our school secretaries about 70 hours of work
the first time it was used (November 1988)."  I can only assume the
secretaries adapted their work habits to the vagaries of this program.

                 File #11763:  RATIONAL.BXY (69300 bytes)
                 ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     The Rational Person by Martin Sandry, Ph.D. and Kenneth Peiser, Ph.D.,
two registered clinical psychologists is a multiple choice quiz that
attempts to help you understand rational thinking.  You are given a
scenario--"I'm with a friend, meet an old friend, and can't remember her
name." and are asked to predict both how a rational person would feel and
what s/he would think.  For both the thinking and feeling options--which
can you do in either order--you are given four possible responses.  There
are 31 scenarios for adults and 23 for children/adolescents.  It's fairly
easy to score well if you use some common sense, but not so easy to get a
perfect score.  In other words, even adults who think of themselves as
<ahem> fairly intelligent and self-aware can learn something from this.

     This program is text-based, but it makes very good use of the text
screen.  It also has a good user interface:  power users won't get
frustrated by hand-holding, and new users won't get frustrated because they
don't know what to do.  It takes advantage of lower case and 80-column
capabilities if it finds them, but doesn't assume they are there.

     This simple BASIC program by Chris Deprospero uses a hi-res clock to
help youngsters use an old-fashioned round analog clock to learn to learn
to tell the time.  It has two modes--look at the hands and enter the time
it represents, or enter a time and have the hands move to that position.
The user interface is pretty simple, but it doesn't get in the way.  An
amusing anamoly occurs if you forget that you're supposed to press Q to
quit and try Control-C:  a new time is chosen and the clock hands are drawn
for that time--without erasing the old hands.

                 '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     World Disk by Michael D. Giltzow is an interactive electronic
political world atlas that resembles a HyperStudio stack.  The program uses
the 320-mode IIgs desktop to present a map of the world with 17 "plates"
(only 3 of which are active in this demo version).

     After you choose a plate, you are taken to a geographical/political
area--in the demo, North America, Central America, or the West Indies.
Each plate has a number of political and/or geographical regions.  For
example, North America has such regions as Canada, Alaska, the continental
United States, Mexico, Greenland (?), Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean,
Hudson Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico.  In "learn" mode, you can either click
on the button for an area, or choose from an alphabetical lists of names.
In either case, the area is labelled.  In "practice" mode, you must match
the name to the button.  There is also an alphabetical name index that
allows you to find a country or area, no matter which plate you happen to
be on.

     The maps are attractive and colorful, but not perhaps as well-rendered
as one might wish, even given the limits of resolution.  The island of
Newfoundland--my home province--is recognizable only from its position, not
its shape.

     The programmer's credentials worry me more than a little.  First, he
manages to misspell "Arctic" as "Artic".  I recognize that this a common
error, but this was meant to be educational software and should have been
caught.  Second, the programmer doesn't seem to know the term "political
atlas"--instead claims it is a "country atlas".  So much for the programmer
as educator--what of the programmer are programmer?  Unfortunately, there
are a few slips there as well.  The check boxes next to the lists of name
don't work in standard fashion in either mode.  In "learn" mode, there is
no way to uncheck a box at all.  In "practice" mode, the check boxes behave
more like radio buttons--except that, if you try to check a second box, the
first click turns off the first box.  Another click is necessary to turn on
the second box.  Somehow I get the impression that the arrival of
HyperStudio quickly relegated this program to the ashcan of history.

                    ~ GenieLamp Profile:  Ryan Suenaga

     This month we meet the new editor of GenieLamp A2, Ryan Suenaga.  A
prolific writer in the Apple II community, Ryan has several staff duties on
A2 both on Genie and Delphi.


GenieLamp>  Who are you, and what is your involvement with the Apple II
"""""""""   community?

Ryan>  I am, let's see, maybe starting with my name would work out: my name
""""   is Ryan Suenaga.  I'm the incoming editor of GenieLamp A2.

     My major contributions to the Apple II world have been with writing.
I have regular columns in Max Jones' _Juiced.GS_ ("II Be Named Later"), and
Steve Cavanaugh's _The Apple Blossom_ ("Talking.II"), and I've had some
things published by Howard Katz and Chris Serrau in _The Appleworks
Gazette_, as well as in _GenieLamp A2_ and _GS+ Magazine_.  I've had some
things published in my user group's newsletter as well, but I've pretty
well given that up over the last few months.  I also do some fooling around
in _Hyperstudio_, and some sysop work in the A2 and PowerPC areas on Genie
and Delphi.  I also got involved recently with the IIScribe forum on
Delphi, which is a home for people who write about the Apple II.

     During the regular workday, I'm a social worker for Kaiser Permanente,
which is a large health maintenance organization, as well as a crisis
worker for the Crisis Response Team.

GenieLamp>  How long have you been involved with computing in general and
"""""""""   the the Apple II in particular?

Ryan>  My dad got the family a computer back in 1982; because he told the
""""   salespeople at ComputerLand that it was for the kids (me and my
older sister), they steered us to an Apple model.  In those days, there
weren't really many other Apple models besides the Apple II, so we went
home with an Apple ][+.  I still have that computer in a closet.  I've been
an Apple II fan ever since.

     Like nearly everyone out there, I've since been exposed to Windows,
MSDOS, and the MacOS, but I still use an Apple II for virtually all of the
real work I need to do.  I have two Apple IIgs systems and an Apple //c+
running at home, as well as a few Macintosh systems to help me with things
that we can't yet do with an Apple II (I can't take one of my II's under my
arm and do some writing over at the coffee shop, and I can't have one of
the II's act as a file server, for instance).

GenieLamp>  Knowing that you have written many articles about the Apple II
"""""""""   for various publications, where did your interest in writing
begin?

Ryan>  I don't really know where any of that started.  I had to write--like
""""   a maniac--while I was in graduate school.  In fact, I started doing
all of this Apple II writing around that time.  I rejoined my local user
group (Hawai'i Macintosh and Apple Users Society) around that time, too,
and they hadn't had an Apple II column in their newsletter for quite some
time, so I started doing that, which was more frustrating than rewarding.
A few months later, I went to my first Kansasfest, and discussed doing some
writing with my roommate there, Bill Moore, who happened to write for _GS+_
on a semi-regular basis.  That led to my getting an article published
there, a review of a Deskjet portable printer, which was the first time I
actually got paid to write something.  I figured it would also look good
for my resume to be able to add some "professional articles published" to
my work experience.  Unfortunately, that was also the _last_ issue of
_GS+_.  However, that did lead to both Steve Cavanaugh and Max Jones asking
me to assist with writing in their publications, so things turned out well
after all.

GenieLamp>  Now that you have become the editor of GenieLamp, can you tell
"""""""""   us about what that publication is, has been and will continue
to be?

Ryan>  GenieLamp is a freeware publication that is published by John
""""   Peters.  Originally, it covered the Atari areas of Genie;
eventually, several different computer RoundTables on Genie started getting
their own versions of GenieLamp.

     GenieLamp is put out on the first of each month.  It includes
highlights of things going on in the Bulletin Board of the RoundTable,
news, reviews, editorials, all the things you'd expect in a publication.

     With the recent downsizing of Genie, GenieLamp A2 is the only version
of GenieLamp that is still publishing.

GenieLamp>  Considering the recent diversification of Apple II presences in
"""""""""   several forms on Delphi and the Internet, can you describe the
role that the GenieLamp publication will play in the expanded market?

Ryan>  GenieLamp's always been pretty freely distributable; in fact, it's
""""   already available on a lot of sites on the World Wide Web, and it's
usually posted on newsgroups (like comp.sys.apple2) within a day or two of
its release.  And several issues (if not all of them) are already available
on Delphi in the IIScribe Forum.

     The first few months I think I'll have my hands full just trying to
keep a production schedule going.  However, I do plan to make GenieLamp A2
available in more places (like the A2 and IIScribe areas on Delphi), and
I'm thinking about putting up a World Wide Web page specifically for
GenieLamp A2.  That'll take time, though.  I'd guess maybe as much as six
months (time, as does not surprise anyone, is on a premium here).

GenieLamp>  Do you have plans to carry information on cross-platform issues
"""""""""   in GenieLamp?

Ryan>  I think that, as much as possible, I'd like to keep GenieLamp A2 as
""""   Apple II specific as possible; however, part of being Apple II
specific means doing cross-platform support.  That might sound weird, and
in some ways it is weird, but it's true.  Some examples of cross-platform
issues that are ery Apple II specific include Apple II emulators (like Gus,
Fast Eddie, and //e 2.0.1), scavanging hardware and software (hard drives,
floppy drives, monitors, CD Roms, fonts, sounds, and more!).

     The other possibility for cross-platform issues in GenieLamp is news
from the general world of computing.  Things like Apple's acquisition of
NeXT, for instance, or the development of the BeOS, which are not Apple II
specific, might be material worth covering in GenieLamp A2.

Ultimately, what the readers want will dictate what is included.

GenieLamp>  Will GenieLamp focus on IIGS issues or is there sufficent
"""""""""   information and interest in catering to the needs of the 8 bit
II User?

Ryan>  That's a tough question.
""""
     There's not a lot of Apple II development going on right now, and most
of it is focused on the IIgs.  When we're talking "news", then, what will
be new tends to be IIgs products.

     This is not to say that the 8-bit Apple II is not still a viable and
usable platform.  Look at three Prodos 8 programs that come to mind:
ProTERM 3.1, Publish It! 4, and Appleworks 5.1.

     With those three programs, an online service or Internet Service
Provider, a //e, and a little hardware, you can cruise the Internet,
compose and receive email, manage your money, do your taxes, write letters,
print out newsletters, and use the latest inkjet and laser printers.
Moreover, those programs would take a fraction of the memory and disk space
that equivalents on a Macintosh would take, for instance.

This is not to belittle what work you can do on another platform; this is
to point out that even 8-bit Apple IIs--late 1970's technology, at
heart--can still do serious work as we approach the late 1990's.

New products for 8-bit Apple IIs are always welcome, and any news of the
8-bit world will be covered in GenieLamp A2.

GenieLamp>  Do you have time, and is there sufficient interest, in
"""""""""   producing  GenieLamp in all the versions that is has been
produced, recently?

Ryan>  Do I have the time?  Well, no, but that hasn't stopped me before.
""""
     Recently, Doug Cuff sent me some extremely detailed notes on the
historyand production of GenieLamp A2, including how to produce those
alternative versions of GenieLamp, including the Hyperstudio and Hypercard
versions.  I would like to continue to put these out, and that is, in fact,
the plan. However, I'm not sure if I can get all of them out as promptly as
Doug did.

     I'd expect, realistically, for GenieLamp A2 in its AWP and TXT
versions to be uploaded to the Genie A2 library (and possibly elsewhere)
sometime on the first of the month.  Note that this does not say
"released", it just says "uploaded".  Also note that it doesn't say
"Eastern time."

The other versions will be uploaded by the fifth of the month.

GenieLamp>  If the focus of GenieLamp becomes multi on line service
"""""""""   oriented will it carry a new name?

Ryan>  I've had a lot of opportunity to think about this.
""""
     I have concerns--I think we all have concerns--about Genie's future.
In my eyes, it's very tenuous.

     Provided Genie is still here and I still have access to the A2LAMP
account--the editor's account for GenieLamp A2--I'll continue to put out
GenieLamp just as it's been produced these last few years.  We may expand
in other areas as well--for instance, I've been considering
re-incorporating A2Pro coverage into GenieLamp A2, as it's been quite some
time since GenieLamp A2Pro's last issue.

     However, if Genie ceases to exist or the A2LAMP account itself ceases
to exist, I think we can safely predict that GenieLamp--_in its current
forms_--will also cease to exist.

     If that happens, I intend to continue to produce a freeware, freely
distributable online publication regarding the Apple II, which I'll discuss
later.

GenieLamp>  GenieLamp was until recently published by the DigiPub forum on
"""""""""   Genie, which is now defunct.  Are there plans to create a new,
or merge GenieLamp into, Forum on Delphi?

Ryan>  GenieLamp A2 will have a home on Delphi--the II Scribe forum, which
""""   is a custom forum set up for people who write about the Apple II.  I
intend to maintain support there as well as on Genie's A2 Roundtable, and
to upload new issues there as well as on Genie.

     If, as I mentioned earlier, GenieLamp and/or the A2LAMP account ceases
to exist, I intend to continue with a GenieLamp-like publication.  This
would be a monthly publication that would be based out of the II Scribe
forum.  It -may- have some restictions on distribution that GenieLamp
doesn't, but that hasn't been decided yet.

     _If_ Genie does cease to exist suddenly, and you would like to know
the status of GenieLamp A2's successor, you can either get on Delphi and
check the II Scribe forum (custom 11) or you can check my web page at
http://www.kestrok.com/~rsuenaga.  Alternatively, you can email me at
rsuenaga@kestrok.com, but I'd prefer you check one of the two mentioned
places first.

GenieLamp>  Will the former editor of GenieLamp, Doug Cuff, play any future
"""""""""role in GenieLamp?

Ryan>  Doug's still with GenieLamp; in fact, he submitted an article for
""""   this issue that I haven't gotten a chance to look at yet.  In fact,
I don't think I would have taken this job without some assurance he'd still
be involved.

     I think Doug's main reason for leaving is that he's needing to spend
more time seeking employment in real life.  And I can tell you that doing
GenieLamp definitely takes a lot of time!

GenieLamp>  What role can the monthly readers of GenieLamp play in assuring
"""""""""   the continued success of GenieLamp?

Ryan>  Write us.  Tell us what you like, what you want, what you don't
""""   like, what you don't want.  Without hearing from you, we'll never
know how to make GenieLamp better.

     Better yet, write for us!  I'm always looking for contributors.

GenieLamp>  Ryan, I think I can say GenieLamp's in good hands.
"""""""""

Ryan>  Thanks.  I hope it is myself.
