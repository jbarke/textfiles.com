Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     Let's get a few things straight....

     One:  Yes, this issue of GEnieLamp A2 is shorter than usual.

     Two:  No, it doesn't mean that GEnieLamp A2 is on the brink of 
extinction.

     As most of you know, editors of the various "flavors" of GEnieLamp 
work for the love it, and certainly not because we're paid.  This month, I 
had to put GEnieLamp A2 on the back burner so I could work on a few things 
that do pay me.  Not to mention prepare for the end of this month, when my 
wife and I move house (again).

     I couldn't have been busier if I'd attended KansasFest.  
Unfortunately, I couldn't afford it this year... and after the great time I 
had last year, it was torture to miss it.  If you're in the same boat as I, 
you'll be slightly mollified to hear that this issue contains KansasFest 
reports from lots of participants.

     To console myself for not being able to attend this year, I ordered 
the videotape of the 1992 KansasFest, which GS+ Magazine have resurrected.  
At only $15 a pop (shipping included in North America), it makes a good 
poor man's KansasFest... even if it is three years old.  The magic is still 
there.

     As soon as I shut up and let you read this month's issue, you'll 
notice that GEnieLamp alumnus Phil Shapiro has returned from sabbatical, 
and is back with his "Thinking About Online Communications" column.  
Welcome back, Phil!  I've missed you.

     A personal note:  this issue makes two full years for me as editor of 
GEnieLamp A2.  Two years ago, I was a complete unknown on GEnie.  In the 
period since, I've started writing for, and went on to edit, both 
_A2-Central_ and _II Alive_, in addition to my duties at GEnieLamp A2.  All 
during that time, my wife has been slogging away at her B.Sc., and hasn't 
uttered a word of complaint about me letting our financial situation worsen 
so that I could do volunteer work on GEnieLamp A2... because I loved it.  
My wife graduated with her degree this summer, and I'd like to congratulate 
her--and thank her--here, because it is she who has made these last two 
years possible.

APPLEWORKS 5.1   > I installed AW 5.1 and it boots up until the FINAL
""""""""""""""   > screen and then it asks me to insert my AW disk!

     This problem should have nothing to do with any hardware or patches. 
I bet you are using the same default macros you used with 5.0, right?

     The problem you are experiencing has to do with a change in the dot 
commands.  The command .awpath used to give the pathname that you launched 
appleworks from followed by a slash such as:  /HD1/AW5/

     Sometimes having a slash at the end of a path will not work properly 
with Appleworks so the default macros did a couple of steps to get rid of 
it and then used the resulting path to load something else.

     The new version has .awpath leave off that extra slash to begin with 
(which really is better), but if you use older macros, they will still 
attempt to cut the slash.  Since it is no longer there, it cuts the last 
letter of the pathname instead!  So, it can't find what it is looking for 
and it asks you to insert the disk.

     Find the <ba-[> macro in the default set.  Now find the following 
lines in it:

          $1 = .awpath :
          Z = len $1 : Z = Z - 1 :
          $1 = left $1,Z :
          .online $1 :

     Just completely delete the 2nd and third line shown above.

     Next find the <ba-#> macro and you will see this:

<ba-#>:<all:
     $1 = .awpath :
     $1 = $1 + "SEG.NA" :

     To fix this one, change the "SEG.NA" to be "/SEG.NA".

     That should do it unless you have some macros of your own that also 
use

     So save this new macro file (I'd used a different name). Then compile 
it and save it as the default set (activate start-up macro should be YES).

     Hope that takes care of it.

PC TRANSPORTER AND FLOPTICALS   Sam, I remember you were having trouble 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   getting your PCT to recognize your 
Floptical.  A question:  Are you using the RamFAST.  If yes, do you allow 
automapping or have you mapped any of the volumes yourself?

     I just discovered that, for some reason, if I map one or more of my 
HD partitions, my Floptical is no longer recognized when I'm in PCT mode.  
In Finder the Floptical is there, in the RF Utilities the Floptical is 
there and mapped where it's always been.  Using File-A-Trix my Floptical 
can be accessed.  But when I go into PCT mode, File-A-Trix no longer sees 
it, it sees RAM3 instead.

     When I unmapped everything (except my first two partitions), all 
worked as before.  I'm not sure why, but I hope this trick works out for 
you.

RAMFAST ERROR CODES   I think it was posted a while ago by Doug P.  I'm not

These are error codes generated by the RamFAST:

     RamFAST Fatal Memory Fault
     ''''''''''''''''''''''''''
     $00     Unknown, probably means that the RamFAST is very confused

     $0C     Z180 processor crashed, indicates some hardware fault
     $0D     Error writing cache data to disk
     $0E     Termination power error

     BTW, the Z180 processor is the main chip on the RamFAST itself, other 
than the ROM and the cache RAM.  It is made by Zilog, but there is also a 
Hitachi equivalent.  I'm glad I could help out, if only a little bit :)

SYSTEM SOFTWARE FIXES   It's on Issue #65 of Softdisk G-S.  FWIW, people 
"""""""""""""""""""""   who want to have the latest bug-fixes for System 
Software should consider buying the following SDGS back-issues while they 
still can:

#54  Fix ROM Blaster      Fixes a memory blaster in ROM on all IIgs's
#57  Desktop Memory Fixer Fixes a "memory-eating" bug with custom 
                          backgrounds
#64  Disk-Mount Bug Fix   Fixes a hanging bug that strikes when 
                          disk-swapping
#65  QD Picture Patcher   Fixes a bug with large pictures (e.g. printing)

     These are the most important of the patches, IMO.  Of course, there 
are other programs on some of the other issues from about #35 on that are 
really worth having.

HERMES / SHADOWWRITE   Okay, I promise this is my last update to this
""""""""""""""""""""   message! :)

> Will someone explain to me the difference between Hermes & ShadowWrite,
> other than the coloring? :\

     The best way to find out, is to get Hermes and put it into your DA's 
folder and try it.  You don't have to remove ShadowWrite, you can run BOTH 
at the same time!  I did this to determine which I liked best.  The small 
bug fix in Hermes is related to the way SW formats documents.  In some rare 
instances, SW would "Forget" and lose the formatting (this is according to 
the Hermes docs, as I never experienced this.)

BUG CONFLICT   I have confirmed that a conflict does exist between Balloon 
""""""""""""   2.0 and my List Manager Patch init.  I am investigating at 
this time.  It looks like somebody (I dunno who) is doing something totally 
abnormal, and I don't currently think it's either me or EGO Systems. :)

USE FOR IBM-COMPATIBLE CPUS   In regards to hard drives there is a good use
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   for IBM's...  The idea was passed on to me, 
and I used it.  Buy a 88 or 288 IBM, (I paid $15), give or sell the guts, 
except for the power supply, use this case, the same color as the //gs, as 
a stand under the gs, to rise the monitor up high enough for easy viewing, 
and to put a cheap internal hard drive in (I just bought a second, 80 meg. 
Quantum for $45 post paid), the power hook up works fine, a couple $$ for 
an adaptor lets you hard hook it up in the drive bay, and you can put three 
more there too... or a CD-ROM.

II+ AND AQUARIUMS   Since Keith asked, I'll elaborate a little on my ][
"""""""""""""""""   Pluses.  They all use power supplies, so maybe I can 
get away with a quick post ;-)

     All my interfacing is done throught the game port, so it's rather 
simple stuff.  One original ][ Plus looks after my cold water aquarium. A 
themistor probe inputs the water temperature via the paddle line, a Basic 
program interprets it and switches a chiller on and off.  One annuciator 
line is used to switch an optically isolated relay circuit, which in turn 
activates a solid state relay wired into the 120VAC line for the chiller 
(actually a converted dehumidifier).  Overkill in isolation perhaps, but I 
used to use mechanical relays for the AC side.  The tricks were to ensure a 
suitable delay before starting the chiller (so that the compressor was not 
trying to do quick on/off cycles) and to make it fail safe, as the chiller 
can easily wipe out my entire fish collection if it stays on.  Automatic 
startup from power failures was another consideration.  It's been running 
continously for a couple of years now without problems.  The only failure 
occurred when a fish broke the glass tube that contained the thermistor.  
Everything shut down safely despite an indicated water temperature of 2700 
degrees!  I use an almost identical set up for controlling my air 
conditioner or radiant heater, depending upon the season.

     The fact that these machines run continuously unattended gives me a 
little concern as I suspect the power supplies are the weak link.  They are 
very lightly loaded though, since each machine has only a Disk ][ 
controller installed (not even a 16K ram card!)  I don't like to use the 
system saver-type external fans, as they are too noisy for my open plan 
studio.  I have finally taken to building "fan cards" from trashed cards.  
I put a low power, brushess fan on the stub of a cut down old card, and 
wire it into the appropriate traces.  The card sits in slot 0 and directs a 
gentle air flow over the power supply case.  I'm amazed at how much cooler 
the supply, and the whole computer runs like this.  Best of all for my 
application, there is almost no sound.  Don't think I'd try this solution 
on my 5 drive, 8 card, Zipped //e though <g>.

     I should put in a plug for Vernier Software here.  I learned 
everything I know about interfacing from David's Apple II project books - 
How To Build A Better Mousetrap and Chaos In The Laboratory - excellent for 
those who like to extend the capabilities of their Apple(s).

     KFest is back again this summer better than ever!

     For many years Resource Central, and then ICON, sponsored a popular 
festival for Apple II computer users called ICONference. Last year the 
festival was expanded to include users of Macintosh computers. Although 
RC/ICON went away, KFest will continue under new sponsorship!

     This summer, in Kansas City, Missouri, you can once again:
  - meet friends old and new
  - learn about how to get the most out of your computer and peripherals
  - see demonstrations of new products
  - meet the celebrities of our little world <grin>
  - experience the InterNet and all that it has to offer to us and our 
    computers
  - take advantage of special KFest '95 offers from Apple II and Macintosh 
    vendors
  - and, of course, stay up all night if you want to :)

     There will be speakers and presentations on a wide variety of topics. 
Presentations scheduled thus far include:

 * Joe Kohn - Shareware Solutions II
 * Erick Wagner - How to Control Real World Devices
 * Mike Westerfield - Quick Click Morph and HyperStuff
 * Tony Diaz - Building a case for the GS
 * Roger Wagner - HyperStudio
 * Greg Templeman - GSLib
 * Richard Bennett and J. Nathaniel Sloan - GS front end for GEnie
 * Doug Pendleton and Dave Ciotti - Solder, the Flux of the Matter
 * Ryan Suenaga - PDA's and PowerBooks - Portability for the Professional

     KFest '95 will again be held on the campus of Avila College in Kansas 
City, Missouri.  It will take place from July 27-29, 1995.  The cost will 
be only $200, which _includes_ use of a double room in the Avila College 
dorms _and_ meals! (If you wish to stay at one of the many hotels or motels 
near the college  then the cost is $150, but you would, of course, have to 
find and pay for your own room).

 ***

     If you have been thinking about attending KFest '95. now is the time 
to sign up.  The registration fee will be going up on July 7th to $225 for 
the dorm and conference, and $170 for the conference only.  The last date  
pre- registrations will be accepted is July 18th.

KANSASFEST PREPARATION (GENERAL)   From some posts I've scanned, I've 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   collected these impressions:

     1. KFest starts just after noon on the 27th.

     2. The dorms are not open the night of the 26th.

     3. KFest ends with a session just after noon on the 29th.

     Are these impressions facts?

     Is there an official schedule, yet?  If so, where do I get one?

     Saturday morning will be the vendor fair and swap meet, but there is 
a "class session" with speakers scheduled for the afternoon.  That way, 
people can get their belongings out of the dorm rooms and spend their hard 
earned $$ too.

     There will be a tentative schedule in your snail mail box within the 
next couple of days.  Everyone that has registered so far will be receiving 
a confirmation letter, tentative schedule, map of KC and Avila, motel 
lists, and what ever else Paul thinks of to include.

     KansasFest-Day 1:

     Apple's local Representative dicussed all the new Apple products, 
most of which will be introduced at MacWorld next month.  There should be 
something exciting for Apple Mac users in at least one of the new products.

     PDA's and Powerbooks by Ryan Suenaga covered "which one for you?"  In 
a very clever group session, Ryan had us pick out the best for us by having 
us decide which assets were most important in our purchase.  Final 
decisions was split, with a couple of us deciding both would be best for us 
:)

     InterNet: The Good,the Bad,and the Ugly by Joe Kohn.   A long time 
Internet user, Joe brought us up to date on the current status of Internet.  
He also noted that things change every minute on this vast network.

     Soldering, by Dave Ciotti and Doug Pendleton.  While many Mac users 
won't be taking a soldering iron to their Macs, this was probably the most 
detailed and BEST discussion of soldering I've ever attended.

     Roger Wagner, of Roger Wagner Publishing Inc. "hosted" the annual 
"Bite the Bag" competition as well as providing a late night "Pizza and 
Soda" festival for all attendees.  Thanks Roger!

KANSASFEST WRAP-UP   After the long and exhausting drive home, and a good 
""""""""""""""""""   night's sleep, I've opened this topic to discuss the 
happenings at KFest 95.  This was one of the best experiences of my life!  
My first impression, the one thing that stays in my mind is this....  Here 
were people who still love the Apple II, and all that it can do.  I felt so 
at home at KFest.  It was nice to be able to sit down with other folks who 
believe in the same thing you do, namely the Apple II.

     There was so much going on at KFest that it is hard to describe it 
all.  There was session after session about things to do with the Apple, it 
was a shame that I couldn't attend them all.  I did attend Joe Kohn's 
sessions.  Joe gave a talk about his experiences with the Apple, how he got 
involved with it.  Joe is a very dynamic speaker, not to mention a most 
personable guy.  There was Roger Wagner, running around like a maniac all 
over the place.  Roger is the kind of person that when you look at him, you 
can't help but start grinning.

     There are really two impressions of KFest that will stay with me for 
a long time.

     'Bite The Bag'.  You have to see this to believe it.  Nothing I can 
say would be adequate to describe this.  I did not participate, simply 
because my ..er.. center of gravity would be a hindrance, I think. :)

     Second Impression?  Well, mainly, it's this.  I don't believe that I 
will ever look at a can of RAID in quite the same manner again.  For sure.

     I'd really like to thank everyone who had a hand in producting KFest 
95.  Cindy Adams is a wonder.  Thanks for all your efforts Cindy.  
(Including not 'thwaping' me too much.)  Thanks to Paul Parkhurst, for 
handling all the details, that made the fest so seamless.  Thanks to all 
the folks who helped in some way, you made a first timer's experience a 
memorable one.

     There are so many things to talk about...Lets' hear about your 
experiences!

>>>>>   This was my first K.Fest.  Thanks to Auri, for getting this year's
"""""   started.  The Staff that brought it to reality.  Roger and Pam, for 
the pizza and pop.  Again to Roger, for the asides about life, during your 
presentations.  Sarah, for the salsa.  Larry (The HACK) Elseman, for the 
walking RTC's.  Tom Weishaar, for coming back.. to enjoy it with us.  And 
to all the 'Names' I've known about, and new friends I meant, for just 
being there.

     We've all read gushing reviews (and rightly so) of the FESTivities, 
over the years.  I am going to make a personal observation, that I don't 
recall ever seeing.  I am going to dare to paint a different picture.. 
coming from a different angle, that never-the-less, draws the same 
"gushing" conclusion.

     Not everyone is interested in everything covered in all the (diverse) 
Events.  Several Events, (by necessity) are scheduled simultainiously.  
Thus, I found myself ruling out a 'Mac' discussion, a way-over-my-head 
programing class, and reluctantly choosing to listen to Dave Ciotti and 
Doug Pendleton, talk about computer repair.. what I considered, the lesser 
of three evils.  Despite that mindset, it turned out to be one of the most 
interesting, informative, and functional demonstrations, of the entire 
weekend.  I don't think any of these folks (even who's subjects, your not 
interested in) are capable of boring seminars.. they love what they are 
doing, and it shows.

     Glad I've been there,
     And done that!

you have to fight off sleep the whole ride.  (It's my fault, I didn't sleep 
much while at KFest!)  Who has time to sleep when there's so much to do and 
so little time to do it in? :)

     My Apple //gs is back at home and it seems happy -- Nothing broken, 
nothing lost, so I am in good shape.

     This was my first KFest and all I can say is "Incredible!"  I had a 
wonderful time meeting everyone and finally putting faces to all the names.

     Wow!  The best part about KFest is that everyone is there for the 
same reason... the Apple II.  Hanging out with a group of Apple orientated 
people for three days straight is a treat. :)  Oh, I also came home with 
the "King of Bite the Bag" crown... something I never dreamed possible, but 
it wasn't easy. :P

     I'll be ordering the extra T-shirts within the next couple of days. 
(After I get my house back in shape after 5 days of mom being gone.)  This 
is  the LAST chance T-shirts can be ordered, so let me know by Tuesday,

Saturday at lunch when I didn't have my list, so you need to email me your 
size and address. That date and time should read 11:00 PM, August 1.

     Probably the worst part of my entire trip was sitting in the airplane 
for 6 1/2 hours.  A dust storm blew through Phoenix at the same time we 
were trying to land.  We circled for 30 minutes, made an attempted landing 
dow to about 200 ft, then flew to Tuscon and waited while 10 planes got 
thier fuel first.  Whatever, I finally made it home after a 3 hour delay.

>>>>>   Some observations from Kfest:
"""""   
     1) Apple II people are the finest people on Earth.  I'm proud to know 
them.  People like Tom Weishaar, Joe Kohn, and Roger Wagner (among others) 
are the kind of people that you will remember all your life.

     2) Apple II people that you meet at Kfest are invariably much nicer 
than they even seem online.  It's always a pleasant surprise to meet 
somebody in person that I know as a nice person from GEnie and find that 
they are VERY nice people.

     3) You mean my GS can do THAT? Wow!

     Best moments that I participated in:

     1) Tony Diaz popping the case on one of those 1.5" Focus hard drives 
he sells and passing it around.  I don't need one, but I WANT one, just 
because it is SO cool!

     2) Dan Cross & buddy stumbling across Tom Weishaar in the hall and 
crying out, "We're not worthy! We're not worthy!"

     3) The look on Ann Pendleton's face when Lunatic sat down next to her 
at lunch.  (She hadn't yet learned what a swell guy Luny is, in spite of 
his extreme appearance. <G>)

     4) Meeting in person several people that I have known from 
correspondence for years and years.  (See Item #2 above -- it applies to 
correspondence as well.)

     Of course, the airlines lost my baggage too :(  It may even surprise 
people that I'm back online, seeing as I lent my modem out to a developer 
to help debug a product, but a friend here has been so kind as to loan me 
his modem.  Of course, I was forced on Saturday night to order a new 28.8 
modem since mine won't be back for awhile :D

     This was my first KFest, and I must say:  Kansasfest is _every bit_ 
what it's cracked up to be.  It was _fully_ worth the expense and I'm 
already working on finding a way to go back next year.

     Thanks to Cindy, Paul, Mark, and Tim (who unfortunately couldn't be 
there):  as well as everyone else who helped put KFest together!

     Tony:  I'm working on my UG column as we type this, and I'll try and 
either post or upload it too.

SECOND SIGHT   Well, after chasing the UPS driver for 1/2 block this 
""""""""""""   morning, I finally received my Second Sight card.

     Installation was only slightly difficult because I have a ROM 01 and 
I had to move my ZipGS out of slot #3 to accommodate Second Sight.  Since 
my sound card lives in slot #2, I had to move it to slot #4 to make room 
for the ZipGS.  It's a good thing I read the manual because I decided to 
test the AppleColor RGB monitor first which requires the removal of a 
jumper on the card.  The ribbon cable is short, very short.  It will only 
reach to the connector directly behind the card.  Well, maybe one over on 
either side but I didn't want to stretch it.  I flipped on the power and 
hoped for the best.

     The boot screen didn't look very different, but I didn't really 
expect it to.  The good news is that I booted normally without any fanfare 
or crashes.  I noticed right away that my monitor acquired what can best be 
described as a "wave."  It kinda reminds me of looking at a reflection in a 
pool of water that is oscillating ever so slightly.  I have no idea what's 
causing it, but it happens no matter which mode I'm in (SHR, text, etc.)

     Text mode is where you really notice the difference.  You are greeted 
by the standard PC font (or a reasonable facsimile thereof.)  I think it 
looks good but it will take some getting used to.  The "wave" is affecting 
the screen as I write this in GEM and it's getting a bit annoying...

     Switching between display modes is not particularly smooth.  Entering 
the CDA screen while I'm in text mode is fine, but the screen jumps a bit 
when I do it from SHR mode.  The manual says that HIRES mode is not 
supported on the AppleColor monitor and I did indeed have some problems 
with it.  But I don't use HIRES too often anyway.

     Now if you thought I wasn't going to have anything nice to say, 
you're wrong.  I fired up the Second View application that comes with the 
card and loaded in some GIFs.  WOW! is truly an understatement.  Second 
Sight allows the AppleColor monitor to display 640x400x256 interlaced and 
it is quite stunning.  It looks darned near as good as many VGA monitors. 
Pictures taller than 400 pixels can be scrolled vertically, but anything 
wider than 640 pixels is chopped off.  The manual says that a VGA monitor 
will display 640x480x256 non-interlaced, but I haven't tested it yet.  
Hopefully, Second View will be updated to support wider screens.

     I'm very happy after my initial testing.  Next, I'll plug in the Sony 
17" MultiScan monitor and see if that darned "wave" goes away.

<<<<<   I found out what's causing the "wave" on my AppleColor RGB monitor.
"""""   It's my System Saver GS fan!  The monitor waves in rhythm with the 
fan's cycle.  The farther away I put the monitor, the better it gets.

     Anyone know why this only happens with Second Sight?  The standard 
RGB output never caused this problem.  Is there a solution, other than 
moving the monitor or swapping fans?

>>>>>   The Second Sight is a wonderful addition to the IIgs, but there are
"""""   a few things that Second Sight and Animasia 3-D owners should be 
aware of:  the Second Sight doesn't emulate the GS' special graphical "fill 
mode," which Animasia 3-D uses as an option for its animations.  Fill mode 
can be disabled when creating animations by unchecking the "Optimize" 
checkbox in the "Animate Options" dialog window.  In general, using fill 
mode is a good idea because fill mode type animations use less disk space.  
To be fair, fill mode is rarely used by anything except games, demos, and 
optionally by Animasia 3-D.

     There is another issue to be aware of with the Second Sight card.  
The way that the Second Sight transfers the GS video to the Second Sight 
video makes animations look poor because the updates don't occur fast 
enough.  The same results also apply to screen blanker effects like those 
used in Twilight II.

KANSASFEST ON THE CHEAP   I'm happy to announce that after being 
"""""""""""""""""""""""   unavailable for almost two years, the "1992 
KansasFest Special Events" video is once again available.  This video 
(formerly sold by Resource Central) contains hilarious footage of all the 
great stuff that went on at KFest in 1992 including:  The Roast of Roger 
Wagner and The Apple Shope and Programmer's Song skits.  The video also 
includes a telephone/video interview that Uncle DOS conducted with Steve 
Wozniak.  This interview covers the history of the Apple II and gives a lot 
of behind the scenes information about the creation of the Apple II and the 
company politics that marked the beginning of Apple's change of attitude 
towards the Apple II.

     Best of all, we've lowered the price of this video from $24.95 to 
just $15!  This price includes postage to the US, Canada and Mexico.  It 
also includes surface mail postage to anywhere else in the world.  (Air 
mail postage outside North America is $5 extra.)  We'll be selling these 
videos at KansasFest, so be sure to let me know if you want one so that we 
can bring enough for everyone!  (Of course, you can also order it from us

                 The premier GS/OS splash screen enhancer

                              by Bret Victor

     Have you grown tired of turning on your Apple IIgs and seeing nothing 
but a bland periwinkle blue screen with a plain window on it?  Are you 
annoyed that your computer, after all you have invested in it, still has 
nothing more to say to you but "Welcome to the IIgs"?  Do you wish you 
could impress your IBM and Mac friends the second you turn on your 
computer?

     Sure, you could download simple freeware utilities to change the 
splash color or icons, but it's still the same bland screen, day after 
day...

     Until now.  Now, you can turn on your computer, and a stunning 
256-color picture of your choice (or design) will fade in from the 
background color... And at the top of the screen, your IIgs will present 
you with a randomly chosen line of text -- a profound quotation, a cynical 
witticism, or whatever you desire.  Finally, you can customize your IIgs to 
be exciting as soon as you turn on the power!


I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T -DO- THAT!  WHAT IS THIS REVOLUTIONARY PROGRAM?
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Opening Line is a combination Init and START.GS.OS patch.  It takes control 
even before GS/OS itself has started loading, and does three things:

1.  It puts a picture file on the screen.  The picture is fully 
    customizable, and can be 640-mode or 320-mode, 16-color or 256-color, 
    with or without a thermometer, with or without the "Welcome" window.  
    The picture file is in the standard SHR screen format (type $C1) so no 
    conversion routines are necessary -- simply name your picture file 
    "STARTUP.PIC" and drop it in the System:System.Setup folder!  It 
    couldn't be easier!

2.  It randomly chooses a "tagline" from a file and puts it on the screen. 
    Again, it is fully customizable -- the tagline file is simply a 
    standard ASCII text file that you can modify or replace as you like.

3.  It fades all of this in smoothly from the background color.  Even this 
    is customizable -- choose the fade speed that is right for you.

     Any of the three features can be easily disabled.  For example, if 
you don't want a tagline, simply delete or rename the TAGLINES file.  If 
you don't want a startup picture, delete or rename the STARTUP.PIC file, 
and Opening Line will use the familiar GS/OS splash screen.  No 
configuration utilities are needed.


WHAT DO I GET?   The complete Opening Line package contains the following:
""""""""""""""
 - The Opening Line Installer (patches the START.GS.OS file quickly and 
   easily)

 - The Opening Line Init

 - Twelve impressive sample startup pictures, in a variety of graphics 
   modes, some with thermometers and some without.  Five of them are 
   original designs by Bret Victor (aka SLIXTER), the renowned artist for 
   PowerGS diskazine, and new GEnie LiveWire IIgs artist.  Plus, you get a 
   picture file that details how to create your own startup pic, including 
   how to control the palettes and thermometer.

 - A tagline file of over 3,000 lines.  (Imagine starting up your computer 
   for eight years and never seeing the same thing twice!)  These lines 
   were carefully selected and edited from much larger tagline files, so 
   only the quality ones remain.  (They were spell-checked, too!)

 - A concise, three-page printed manual.  (So as to not waste your valuable 
   time with excess verbosity.)

     Opening Line also boasts a fast speed of operation, intelligent error 
checking, and an innovative custom random number routine to ensure that you 
get a different tagline every time you start up GS/OS.  Opening Line is 
compatible with Custom.GSOS as well, in case you are strongly attached to 
your old custom icons.


ALL THIS FOR LESS THAN THE COST OF DINNER AND A MOVIE?!?   That's right:  
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Opening Line 
costs only --> twelve bucks! <--

friends, make starting up your computer more exciting...  and turning on 
your IIgs to find a giant alligator grinning at you, with a line at the top

EXCLUSIVE SHAREWARE FROM SSII   Several years ago, when I worked for Big 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Red Computer Club, we were able to raise 
$1,000 to donate to the Alliance For Technology Access, a non-profit 
organization that works towards getting computers into the hands of people 
with disabilities.  That was accomplished through a three-way deal I had 
set up with Mark Simonson - the then owner of Beagle Bros - concerning the 
profits generated on BRCC's distribution of the Beagle Bros Oldies 
software.

     The soon-to-be-re-released-as-shareware program I alluded to another 
message will be available exclusively through Shareware Solutions II, as we 
are setting up a similar type of fund raising effort for an International 
non-profit organization.  In short, a percentage of the proceeds generated 
from the distribution of the disk containing the shareware program will be 
donated to a non-profit organization chosen by myself and the author of the 
software program.

     Hopefully, all the loose ends will be tied up soon.

     By supporting Shareware Solutions II, you can help to make the world 
a better place.

           >>> OUR FAVORITE TEN *COMPUTER* LIGHT BULB JOKES <<<
           """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     In the December 1994 issue of GEnieLamp A2, we ran our all-time 
favorite light bulb jokes.  (For those of you who missed that issue, here 
is a brief recap:  folk singers, surrealists, lawyers, Christians, "Jewish 
mothers", brewers, accountants, mystery writers, Zen masters, and junkies.)  
The response to that column was amazing--a didn't hear a word from a single 
one of you--so I've decided to torture you with my top 10 light bulb jokes 
about computer users.  And I'll keep this up until I make someone squeal.  
I've got over a hundred light bulb jokes left, and more arriving every day.  
Mwaah ha ha!


Q:  How many Microsoft employees does it take to change a light bulb?
     A:  Eight.  One to change the bulb and seven to make sure Microsoft 
         gets $2 for every light bulb ever changed anywhere in the world.

Q:  How many IBM technical writers does it take to change a light bulb?
     A:  100.  Ten to do it, and 90 to write document number 
         GC7500439-001, "multitasking incandescent source system facility", 
         of which 10% of the pages state only "this page intentionally left 
         blank" and 20% of the definitions are of the form "a ----- 
         consists of sequences of non-blank characters separated by 
         blanks".

Q:  How many Pentium designers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
     A:  1.99904274017, but that's close enough for non-technical people.

Q:  How many Windows users does it take to change a light bulb?
     A:  One, but he or she will swear up and down that it was JUST as 
         easy for him as it would be for a Macintosh user.

Q:  How many IBM PC owners does it take to change a light bulb?
     A:  Only one, but he'll have to go out and buy the light bulb adaptor 
         card first, which is extra.

Q:  How many Newton users does it take to change a light bulb?
     A:  Foux!  There to eat lemons, axe gravy soup.

Q:  How many GEnie users does it take to change a light bulb?
     A:  Two... or three during prime time.

Q:  How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
     A:  None, that's a hardware problem.

Q:  How many first-time computer users does it take to change a light bulb?
     A:  One, but it takes him three hours and two phone calls to the 
         electrician before he realizes he forgot to turn the switch on.

Q:  How many hackers does it take to change a light bulb?
     A:  Five.  One to steal a shipment of arc lamps going to the Lousiana 
         Superdrome.  One to install a six-ton air handler and cooling 
         system.  One to reroute the voltage lines from his area to Mexico, 
         causing a brown-out throughout Canada.  One to rewire the house 
         with sixteen-inch coaxial cable.  And one unscrew the light bulb 
         to substitute the greater light source.

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

   [P.SHAPIRO1]



            >>> "NOTCHING"--WHEN ONE THING LEADS TO ANOTHER <<<
            """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Social aspects of online communications are a most fascinating 
phenomenon.  In the past few years I've tried to pay close attention to how 
people interact online.  One of the most interesting phenomenons is 
something I've come to think of as "notching."

     Notching occurs when somebody adds an extra "notch" to an online 
conversation.  So if I were to send e-mail to a friend or colleague 
inquiring about one thing, and then they reply asking or offering 
information about something else, then a "notch" has taken place.

     As a visual metaphor for "notching," imagine two small gears 
interacting.  As one gear turns, it invariably gets the other gear turning 
as well.  And once the second gear is in motion, it impels the first gear 
to keep turning as well.

     Then if you draw back and look at these gears from a few steps away, 
you'll notice that these two gears are interacting with other gears as 
well.  And if you step back further still, you'll see thousands and 
thousands of gears all connected and rotating in concert.  This connection 
of gears is known, in certain circles, as society.

The Nature of Notching   What is the nature of notching?  Why is this 
""""""""""""""""""""""   phenomenon something deserving of its own name?

     The nature of notching derives from the nature of human interaction.  
Human beings are far more likely to bring up a new topic of discussion if 
there is already an ongoing exchange taking place.  The nature of human 
interaction is such that anyone who raises a new topic for discussion needs 
to provide a context for taking such action.  And spelling out a few 
introductory sentences for each new idea you want to bring up takes a great 
deal of emotional effort.

     The emotional effort of introducing a new topic of discussion is 
minimized when you can raise that new topic as part of a reply to an e-mail 
message already sitting in your mailbox.  The proverbial "by the way" 
(abbreviated to "btw" by experienced e-mail users) tacked on to the end of 
a message has enormous social implications.

     A "by the way" appendage to an e-mail message signifies a transition 
to a new (but related) topic.  Implicit in the writing of the "by the way" 
appendage is a common understanding that the recipient of the e-mail 
message would likely have some interest in the information content of the 
"btw appendage."

     The phenomenon of notching has deep implications in the realm of 
human initiative.  If it's an established aspect of online communications 
that "one thing leads to another," then it behooves people who are 
interested in having things happen to "start the ball rolling."  Any 
pertinent and interesting e-mail message might just well spawn an e-mail 
response whose scope is much larger than the initial message.  What starts 
off as being a casual e-mail exchange could conceivably develop into 
something of much larger import.

     Just as in life, it's the nature of the online experience that one 
thing leads to another.  The facility with which e-mail can be sent and 
received, though, makes it much more likely that gears start turning 
online.  Sometimes it takes just a few keystrokes between two individuals 
for a larger gear-turning enterprise to take form.

Notching and Online Collaborations   Notching is the central activity of 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   all online creative collaborations.  
People working on a shared writing project, or a shared software 
development project, have an implicit understanding that each person 
participating in the project will keep the gears of creative development 
turning at a roughly equivalent speed.  

     Last month, I had an opportunity to experience notching first hand 
when working on a collaborative software development project.  A colleague 
of mine in California volunteered to work on a freeware educational 
software project I proposed.  Each day he would add a few new features to 
the program, and send the work-in-progress over to my online mailbox.

     The implicit understanding we had when we started this project is 
that I would provide prompt and thoughtful feedback to him as he went 
through the steps of adding further features and refinements to this 
software.  Once the project got underway, I checked my e-mail about three 
to four times each day.   

     Whenever I received a copy of the work-in-progress software, I 
stopped whatever else I was doing to test the software and send feedback.  
Once, I happened to let a full day pass before sending feedback to my 
programming colleague.  In a friendly way, my colleague pointed out that I 
had lapsed by not sending him immediate feedback about the work he was 
doing.  In other words, my gear was turning slower than his and he was 
suggesting I change my ways to get the gears turning in sync again.

     I laughed and laughed when I received his message because neither one 
of us had spelled out our expectations for this project.  But since we were 
both experienced online users, we had an implicit understanding of the 
"notching" nature of online collaborations. 

     In thinking about this, I came to understand that I had a moral duty 
to provide a roughly comparable amount of volunteer effort to the volunteer 
effort being undertaken by my colleague.  It would be an egregious breech 
of online etiquette to agree to participate in an online collaboration, and 
then not follow through with a good faith effort on my part.

     Considering the fact that the two of us meshed well in this project, 
and that we might work on other fruitful collaborative projects in the 
future, I quickly mended my ways to get my gear turning as fast as his.  
Interestingly enough, his gear was spinning fast enough that I felt 
compelled to go out of my way to keep pace.

The Implications of Notching   The implications of notching are that it 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   behooves people to stay in touch with one 
another, even if any particular e-mail message does not have much actual 
substance.  The very fact that your e-mail message shows up in someone 
else's mailbox can help remind them of your existence.  And if they're not 
totally extended in their own work, they will naturally respond with 
whatever they happen to have on their minds.

     Therefore, a "notched" e-mail exchange bypasses all the labor 
involved in writing an introductory section to your e-mail messages.  Which 
helps the gears of society spin round and round.

Yours For the Downloading
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Charlie Hartley
      [A2.CHARLIE]


     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt!

     This month we will concentrate on animations for the Apple IIGS.  I 
recently received a copy of PaintWorks Gold, and decided to investigate the 
variety of animations in the A2 library that have been created using the  
PaintWorks animation filetype.  There are really quite a few, many of them 
of excellent quality.

     The ones that I will describe below caught my eye as I scanned the 
list of animations in the library.  Consider them a representative sample 
of the files available to you.

     The first three files listed below are animation viewers that are 
available in the library.  Two are freeware, one is shareware.

     One other thing:  I've changed the way I will present these files to 
you.  The header for each file will contain the file number, followed by 
the file name, followed by file size in kilobytes.  For the animations, I 
have listed the size both packed, and expanded.  The packed size will give 
you an idea of how long it should take to download it.  The expanded size 
will tell you how much room you will need to unpack it.

     Now, let's get started.

                                 [*][*][*]

     This type $C2 (PaintWorks) animation displayer by Jason Harper makes 
it possible to view all of the following animations, even if you don't have 
another program to do it.  It allows you to speed up, or slow down the 
animation, or even stop it and step through it frame by frame.  It is 
copyrighted freeware.  This is the viewer that I used as I prepared this 
column.

                            """"""""""""""""""


21782  A2GS4EVER.BXY  789k - 804k expanded
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is an excellent 3D Paintworks animation created by Charles 
Sarchet on Delphi.  It shows the words "Apple IIGS 4 Ever" rotating 
independantly around different axes.  It is done in gray-scale with 
shading.  This file is too large to fit on a 3.5" disk.  You MUST unpack to 
a volume with more than 800K available.


16650  CPU.SHOW.BXY  101k - 145k expanded
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This animation of a floating, rotating Apple IIgs shows the GS 
rotating to the right on an aqua background.  It rotates a bit too fast to 
suit me, but that may be because of my accelerated Zip Chip.  When I slowed 
it down with Jason Harper's animation displayer, it looked very nice.


20013  DEATH.ANIM.BXY  530k - 567k expanded
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is converted from an .FLI (Autodesk Animator FLIc) file called 
Death.FLI.  It displays a metallic skeleton rotating to the left on a 
background of black and shades of blue with nice shading and lighting 
effects.  It was apparently produced by Digital Visions of Los Angeles as a 
promo piece.


22516  HEART.SOLE.BXY  65k - 82k expanded
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is a color animation of a smoothly beating heart resting on what 
appears to be blue linoleum flooring of the type one would normally find in 
a kitchen.  Behind the heart is a shoe turned on its side, with the sole 
showing.  No blood or gore... just a beating heart.  In the corner is a 
message, "Heart and Sole - That's what you mean to me."  The shifting 
shadow behind the beating heart is nicely done as well.


18739  MULTIJUGGLE.BXY  336k - 358k expanded
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is a really neat PaintWorks animation of several reflecting 
spheres being juggled by three weird objects made out of collections of 
spheres themselves.  It's all happening on a multi-colored checkerboard 
landscape, with shadows of the spheres and juggler's arms and everything.  
It was originally created by R. Morgan, 1/18/90.  It was heavily edited and 
cleaned up by Lunatic, 5/28/92.


20327  PREY.SHOW.BXY  310k - 350k expanded
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is a PaintWorks animation of a green Klingon Bird of Prey 
starship, from Star Trek.  The ship zooms in from the right, turns and 
zooms towards you, then turns again, changes its wing configuration, and 
flies of to the left.  It would be nicer if the ship actually entered and 
left the screen, instead of appearing and disappearing, but it is still 
nicely done.  It was converted from an AutoDesk Animator .FLI file.


20310  WAVE.SHOW.BXY  74k - 98k expanded
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This neat PaintWorks animation of a rippling stylized "W" on a square 
marbled tile suspended in space looks like purple Jello.  When you speed it 
up, it is really nice.


18208  COASTER.BXY  461k - 579k expanded
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This nice color animation places you on a roller coaster track in a 
3"x4" window on a black background.  Crank up the speen and it might have a 
queasy effect on you.  Nicely done.


20959  GIRL.17.ANI.BXY  1433k - 1459k expanded
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is a full screen, color PaintWorks animation that A2.Lunatic 
converted from an AutoDesk Animator .FLI file.  It shows one woman's face 
morphing (changing) into another woman's face, and is very well done.  The 
main problem with this file is that it requires a lot of disk space.  If 
you do not have a hard drive, and lots of memory, don't bother with this 
one.  At 2400 baud, it will take about two hours for the transfer.


23486  APL2ANIM.BXY  189k - 203k expanded
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     This is a color paintworks animation of the text "Apple II Forever," 
in burnished gold, rotating forward.  Scott Everts rendered this in Flying 
Fonts on the PC and converted the file to the GS.  According to Everts, it 
works as a great screen saver for Twilight II.  It's not quite as nice as 
the IIGS animation mentioned earlier, but still very nice.


24671  RINGS.BXY  255k - 299k expanded
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     John Graham calls this, "one of my favorite Animasia 3-D creations so 
far."  Done in gray-scale, it shows two rings, one large ring rotating 
forward, and one small ring rotating right inside the larger ring.  Crank 
up the speed and it is really nice.


20057  X29.SHOW.BXY  465k - 501k expanded
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

     A2.Lunatic describes this as "a really cool MULTI-PALETTE PaintWorks 
animation of the experimental X-29 aircraft.  It comes in from the lower 
left, does a multi-position barrel roll, and then exits to the upper right.  
This animation was converted from an Autodesk Animator file.  Really nice!"
