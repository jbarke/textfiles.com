Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     The news from KansasFest is the most exciting news I've heard in 
years.  Apple is now beta-testing GuS, an Apple IIgs emulator (in software) 
designed to run on Power Macintosh computers.  You'll read plenty about 
that in this month's HEY MISTER POSTMAN.

     It would be plenty exciting if anyone announced software emulation of 
the IIgs, but the mere idea that Apple themselves are involved makes my 
eyes light up.  Let's face it, folks, however much we might curse it 
sometimes, Apple's meticulous works for us here.  They'll make sure the 
emulation follows the rules.

     Just the announcement of GuS will mean a shift in the thinking of 
those who program the Apple IIgs.  Even I, who no one will ever call a 
programmer, have made an adjustment or two.

     Like many who discovered the Apple II in the early 1980s, I taught 
myself BASIC using the Applesoft Tutorial manual from Apple, Beagle Bros 
tip books, _Open-Apple_/_A2-Central_, and _Nibble_ magazine.  Once I 
discovered the various ID bytes that let you determine exactly which model 
of Apple II your program is running on, I became determined to use them in 
my own BASIC programs to do scrupulous checks of a user's hardware.

     The problem was that there was no single ID byte for determining if 
software was running on a IIgs.  No official byte, that is.  But while Val 
Golding was working for _Softdisk_, he reported on a byte that programmers 
could check.  Golding issued a caution:  "It is not officially recognized 
by Apple and therefore may not be valid for future versions of the GS."

     Yeah, right.  I didn't let that worry me.  I just made sure that the 
byte was valid on ROM 0, ROM 1, and ROM 3 IIgs's.  No one, especially 
Apple, was ever going to put out a new IIgs.  Or so I thought.

     It looks now as though I'll have to change my few BASIC programs that 
make use of this unofficial ID byte.  It might just be valid under an 
emulator, of course.  But you can bet your boots that Apple's 
officially-sanctioned method of check for a IIgs _will_ work on the 
emulator.  Which is good news for all of us.

                                 [*][*][*]


     Last month, I told you how close you came to losing me as editor of 
GenieLamp A2.  (Which I still think would have been a good thing for all 
you readers.)  This month, I can tell you how close you came to losing 
GenieLamp A2, GenieLamp A2Pro, and all other versions of GenieLamp.

     As of mid-July, Genie closed a bunch of low-traffic RoundTables.  
Among them was DigiPub, the gathering place for all of us who publish, 
edit, and write for the various GenieLamps.  (The problem was that it 
wasn't much more than a gathering place for GenieLamp staff.)  Thanks to 
our publisher, John Peters, GenieLamp was saved at pretty much the last 
minute.

     As a result, none of us is sure what the future holds for GenieLamp.  
It doesn't seem likely that it will stay exactly the way it was, but I 
can't even guess what changes are coming.

     As far as I know, GenieLamp A2 is the only version of GenieLamp 
publishing this month.  I'm publishing with John Peters' blessing, but very 
little more... certainly there aren't any GenieLamp facilities any more.  
This month, GenieLamp A2 is not _practically_ a one-person operation; it 
_is_ a one-person operation.  I suppose this means that even if the 
GenieLamp structure folds, I can keep putting out some sort of magazine for 
Genie's A2 RoundTable, whether it's called GenieLamp A2 or something else.

     Now that I've soothed any fears, I have to announce that the 
September issue of GenieLamp A2 is going to be late.  I'm actually getting 
a summer vacation this year, for the first time in at least five years.  I 
won't be back until September 1, which is the day the September issue is 
due.  Well, even if I _could_ put together an issue in less than 24 hours, 
I don't intend to try, so you'll have to resign yourselves to a late issue.

     I am hoping that by the time the next issue is due, we'll all know 
what the future holds for GenieLamp A2, and that I'll have joined my 
brother and sister GenieLamp editors in producing to a more regular 
schedule.

     See you sometime around the middle of September, I hope.

NINJAFORCE PROMISES NEW GAME   You might have heard that we are busy
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   working on a new game for the IIgs.  The 
game is based on the popular Bomberman, an arcade classic which is 
considered one of the best multi-player games of all time by many serious 
game players around the world.  Since its initial release in 1983, 
Bomberman got converted for many computer and video game platforms, 
excluding the Apple II.  And since we have always been fans of the game, we 
had the idea of making a GS adaption that would feature the same addictive 
game-play.  It will be a fast action-paced arcade game for up to four 
players simultaneously!  A screenshot has been uploaded onto Genie and 
comp.sys.apple2.  In case you were not able to pick a copy of it, please 
let us know and we'll get one to you.

     Greetings from Germany,

Jesse Blue & Clue / Ninjaforce
ug0a@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de


WANTED:  APPLE II BBSES OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA   My name is Doede Boomsma,
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   and you may know me of Dark 
Castle Magazine.  But I am not going to promote this well-running magazine 
now.  No, I'm going to tell something about Apple II BBSes. Maybe you are 
interested, maybe you aren't.

     More than two years ago I dialed a BBS in America.  It was called 
Computist BBS, and it still exists.  I fell in love with the BBS software, 
and wondered if it ran on an Apple II.  After asking the sysop (Andy-C), he 
confirmed that it ran on his Apple IIgs.

     Since I wanted to start a BBS, I asked if I could get a copy of his 
BBS software.  So he sent me two disks with the software, and I was happy.

     [lots of things happened]

     And I'm still happy with the software.  There have been updates and 
fixes, and it even runs better now.  We have internet email, usenet groups, 
local conferences and networked conferences.  And of course huge file 
transfer sections.

     The software that my BBS and those who are connected through the 
network, is METAL/FutureVision 4.1.  This software is great!

     But unfortunately, a lot of Apple II BBS's have gone down, and 
besides mine, there is only one other METAL/FV BBS in Europe.  It is run by 
Magnus Ericson, and his BBS is called Aug-Sweden.

     Hereby I would like to ask other people in Europe, but also in 
America and Australia, New Zealand, and other countries, to join the group.  
This is THE way to get in touch with other Apple II users in the world if 
you can't afford an Internet or Genie account.

     For more information you can email me at 
dark_dude@darkcastle.ecore.fnet.org, and I can send you a complete and 
smoothly running system if you want.  Or you can ftp it from the support 
site.

     Come on, and join the group.  It is really worth it!  You, as a 
sysop, will help a lot of other Apple II users in your country or region.  
Wanted systems:  Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Finland, 
France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Austria and maybe even more in 
the eastern part of Europe.

     Mail now, and ask for the software or ftp site address.  It's all 
free, even the Internet mail and usenet feeds!

     On behalf of the whole crew,

-= Doede =-   a.k.a. Dark Dude.

     The freeware editions of these programs have been uploaded to the

     You may be wondering why I am making these commercial grade programs 
available as freeware.  The answer is simple.  I have not received a 
shareware payment, or had any new orders for any of these programs in quite 
some time.  It seems fairly clear that there are few, if any, folks who are 
willing to spend money on these programs now.

     Yet, I am reasonably certain that there are lots of folks who would 
enjoy and benefit from these programs if they had them.

     So, here they are.  Enjoy them.  Share them with your kids.  Make 
copies and take them to schools that still have Apple II computers.  Spread 
them far and wide.  That way, you will make me and others happy.

     I want to take this opportunity to thank the many many people who 
paid their shareware fees, and purchased the programs from me.  I am indeed 
grateful for your support.

     Before I conclude this message, one thing needs to be said.  I know 
that some will wonder if this means that I'm leaving the Apple II.  The 
answer is NO.

     Dear Chuck,

     Please consider this letter as authorization from me to freely 
distribute the program Chinook SCSI Utilities to anyone who has an interest 
or a need.  I believe that I own the software rights to that program.  I 
even have the source code (in Merlin) and if anyone has an interest in 
that, I'd be glad to send hem a copy.  I do not wish to receive any money 
associated with this.  I consider any APple II programs that I have written 
over the years to be in the public domain at this time.  This would include 
any rights hat I may have to the No Slot Clock program, the Business Card 
Clock program, Print Using & Friends, and any other programs you maay find 
written by me.  Many of these I have uploaded to GEnie in my name.  You may 
charge a small amount to cover your costs in connection with this 
distribution if you wish to.  Best of Luck to you.

     Thanks.

     As to the No-Slot-Clock software, latest version, Craig Peterson may 
not have copyright, but if the company, SMT is no longer in business, and 
the software cannot be used by other than the No-Slot-Clock anyway, then 
Craig probably has the right to release its use.........

KANSASFEST REPORTS   I guess I get to make the first KFest report, which 
""""""""""""""""""   only seems appropriate since I arrived here first, and 
I'm the "Big Cheese".

     The weather is warm, but doesn't seem too muggy -- yet.  (Which must 
mean the humidity isn't too bad.)  I heard that it's supposed to be near 
100 before the week is over. :)

     I checked in with Avila, and they are ready for us!!!

     If you arrive during the afternoon on Wednesday, you should just go 
directly to Marian Centre to get your room assignment and key.  If you 
arrive during the 7:30 - 10:00 hours, you might want to stop at  KC 
Masterpiece (Metcalf and I-435) first, and then go get settled in your 
room.  There will be signs on the doors at Avila telling you who to contact 
for late check-in.

     Marian Centre and Ridgway Dorm are on the north side of the campus.  
If you are going south on Wornall, turn left on 118th, and then take the 
SECOND right into the parking lot, and you will see Marian Centre, and 
Carondelet (sp) dorm.  Ridgway is a little farther back.

     Just remember to bring cool and casual clothes, and plan on getting 
minimal sleep.

     See yu'all tomorrow!!!

>>>>>   K.C. Masterpiece was very good last night
"""""
     Today I attended Will Nelken's session on AppleWorks/Macros, which 
was very enlightning, and might even inspire me to write a few macros of my 
own.  Then I went to Ewen and Dave Hecker's Specrum session, and learned a 
bit about scripting and works in progress. 

     Lunch.  College cafeteria fare, but I don't think anyone was 
complaining about starvation.

     After lunch GraphicWriter III with Richard Bennett & Dave Hecker, 
where we learned more about the new features and some planned for the 
future.  I then went to the robotics session with Erick Wagner & Mike 
Westerfield, and learned that there is more to learn than can be done in an 
hour and a half.  Mike's robots provided a lot of entertainment.  Eric 
covered the basics and sources.

     It's almost time for supper, with the Keynote Address and couple more 
sessions to follow.  I actually slept well the first night, but tonight is 
"Bite the Bag" night, with Pizza paid for by Roger Wagner, even though he 
was unable to be here.

>>>>>   The pizza was fine, but the fire drill delayed consumption a few
"""""   minutes, coming as it did just after they arrived.  Bite the Bag 
was postponed until Fri nite, because too many people decided to go out to 
see Independence Day instead on Thur nite.

     Dr. Stephen Buggie arrived tonight, late, and my Roommate, David 
Stephens went to the airport to pick him up.  We then each bought one of 
his power supplies, and chatted a while, so here it is, almost 3 am, and 
I'm typping this final report for Thursday.  More tomorrow.

>>>>>   Well, Gary's speech is worth waiting a few minutes for.  It may be
"""""   longer due to the major thunderstorm arriveing just now.  I'm 
getting off before the power fails and going to watch Bite the bad 
postponed from last night. More about my day and the roast later.

     Later - The storm came close enough to give us a spectacular 
lightning show, but no rain, and no power problems.  I shut down without 
sending the previous after two unsucessful attempts to call.  Scott 
Johnson, last years runner up, won the Bite the Bag contest, which I missed 
seeing because I was watching the natural fireworks.  I guess that means I 
HAVE to buy the tape. 

     After breakfast, I went to the Apple Presents session and watched 
QuickTime movies, then went to Dr. Stephen Buggie's Disk ][ and Apple 
diagnostics session.  He briefly described all the many dignostic programs 
for disk testing, adjustment and repair that have been introduced over the 
years.

     After lunch, I went to the Desktop Publishing and the IIGS session, 
presented by Juiced GS publisher Max Jones.  He brought a sample of his day 
job work, as well talking about layout and design in desktop publishing. 

     The next session was Tony Diaz with The Portable GS.  He showed and 
amazing array of disk drives that have been designed for Apples over the 
years.  Many were prototypes that never made it to market.  At the same 
time, Doug Pendleton and Dave Ciotti were next door, working on monitor 
repair.  I wandered back and forth, getting some of both. 

     Then it was Banquet time, followed by a roast of Joe Kohn.  Buy the 
video. ;)  After that, it was time for the Bite the Bag and watching the 
Olympic opening cerimonies.  And the aformentioned storm watching.

>>>>>   Where did I leave off?  Saturday morning, I chose sleep over
"""""   breakfast.  The Vendor Fair was fairly busy, and I got a few 
things.  Will Nelken's books, Quick Clic Morph from Mike Westerfield, a new 
SCSI system cable from Doug Pendleton, The Spectrum 2.1 upgrade from 
SevenHills, the Script Central set from Joe Kohn, a subscription to The 
AppleWorks Gazette, and the three back issues from Howard Katz.  Then lunch 
in the cafeteria, my last meal there.  Afternoon was product introductions.  
There was an update to ProTerm Mac, some games and other stuff from Joe 
Kohn, and the stunning introduction of Gus.  Except for Gus, I spent most 
of that time packing and loading everything into the van.  At various times 
during the day, there were goodbys as people departed for various reasons.  
Most of those who were left at 7 pm went to Jess & Jims for Supper.  Since 
I was leaving from home from there, I limited myself to a 14 oz. fillet.  
There were several larger cuts available.

     The drive home was somewhat eventful.  As I drove north on I-435, 
there was a constant lightning show going on ahead of me.  As I turned east 
toward the airport and I-29, I drove into the rain.  It was heavy enough 
for me to slow down, and when I was nearly blinded by lightning, I stopped 
under the next bridge, a wide one with a generous shoulder on the road.  I 
waited there for about half an hour, not only for the rain, but also for 
the lightning to let up.  When you get a flash-bang just as fast as you can 
say it, it's too close.  I stopped for gas when I got past the I-35 
turnoff, and by then I was out of the rain, for the moment.  After that, I 
had light rain and drizzle on and off for much of the way home.  I stopped 
for a snack at the second Missouri rest stop, and stopped for a nap at the 
Iowa rest stop.  I got home about 3, unloaded with some help from my son 
who was still up, unpacked my suitcase and got ready for bed.  By then it 
was 4 am, but I set my alarm for 11:30, planning to go to church.  When the 
alarm went off, I changed my mind and went back to sleep until 4 pm.

     I put my system back together, using my new power supply from Dr. 
Stephen Buggie.  Everything seems to be working OK.

>>>>>   This was my second trip to Kfest, and remarkably enough, I seem to
"""""   have survived quite well.  Kfest is the premier event in the Apple 
II world, and this years conference was no exception.

     I arrived at Avila a little bit after noon, and wandered into the 
Marian Center to register.  The first person I saw was Cindy Adams, who, 
true to form, came up to me and said "You're five minutes late!"  Thwap!  
Made me feel right at home, she did.  After registrating, and getting my 
room key, and my Kfest T-shirt, I walked over to the dorm, found my room, 
and got my stuff squared away.  I walked back over to the Center, and saw 
Richard Bennett, Dave Ciotti and son, Erick Wagner, and Max Jones wander 
in.  (I keep using the word wander.  That's what you do at Avila, you 
wander around, meeting people and laughing your head off).

     There was a new identification system in place.  We all had to wear 
blue wristbands to identify ourselves as guests of Avila.  This was not a 
big problem for me, though it did seem like we were all hospital patients.  
Wednesday evening, everyone who was there by then went over to 
K.C.Masterpiece.  The food was good, though slightly overpriced to my 
thinking.  Heading back to the dorm, we wandered around, visiting each 
other and looking at computers and just generally settling in.

     The next morning, after breakfast, the sessions started.  My first 
session was 'Soldering - Which end is Hot', given by BINARY.BEAR, Dave 
Ciotti.  I had done some soldering in the past, but Dave went though all 
the tricks that you can use to solder like a pro.  I found out things that 
I never realised before, so for me it was a very informative session.

     Next up was '(All About) Spectrum'.  Even though I don't have that 
program, I was curious enough to try to find out more about it.  It was a 
very interesting presentation.  So interesting, that later in the week I 
bought a copy. :)

     After lunch, It was 'GraphicWriter III', another excellent session.  
After that, I attended David Kerwood's 'NETSCAPE - HOW TO' session.  This 
proved to be informative and useful for me, and I picked up a lot of tips 
and tricks to get around.  Nice job, David.

     Thursday night was supposed to be BITE THE BAG night, but was 
postponed to the next night, since most all the contestants went to the 
movies.  So, Pizza was bought and delivered (courtesy of Roger Wagner and 
Mike Westerfield) and just as we were about to chow down on the pizza, the 
Avila folks decided to hold a fire drill.  Fun, huh?  I grabbed what was 
important, my pizza, and went outside.  After a good laugh was held by all, 
we went back inside.  The rest of the evening and night were taken up doing 
the usual visiting, playing on computers, and more.

     Oh yes, I forgot.  Gary Utter gave a keynote speech which I hope will 
be uplaoded here on A2.  It was inspiring to hear, and I was very impressed 
by it.  The word 'Community' was mentioned a lot.  Very nice, Gary.  And, 
later, 'Wolfenstein 3D' was demoed.  I understand it will be finally 
released in a month or so.  It is going to be a blast.  Literally. :)

     Friday, after breakfast, Kurt Ackman of Apple Computer demo'ed some 
stuff that Apple Computer is working on.  It was very informative, and we 
were gentle with him. :)  After that session, I attended the Publisher's 
and Writers Forum, hosted by Ryan Suenaga. Howard Katz, Max Jones, and Joe 
Kohn were on the panel.  They each explained what their publications were 
about, and why they were involved.  To say the least, I was very impressed 
with these gentlemen.  (Yes, even you, Howard).  If you have a chance, do 
subscribe to their respective publications.  They each fill a unique area 
of the Apple II world, and are not to be missed.

     After Lunch, I attended Brian Gillespie's HyperCard session.  He 
demo'd Quarknet, a hypercard offline processor for Genie.  And much more, 
too.  Check it out, it's really nice.  I was then going to attempt to 
attend Charlie Hartley's HTML session, but got sidetracked, and was unable 
to attend it all.  But, I got the handout, and that should help a lot.  
Maybe.

     Next up was the roast of Joe  Kohn.  Poor Joe.  He sure does have 
some good friends.  Steve Disbrow was master of ceremonies, and as usual, 
Steve keeps the evening flowing.  Sometimes, it's a river, sometimes its a 
dry stream, but he really TRIES, you know?  Anyway, Will Nelken, David 
Kerwood, Tim Kellers, and Bill Heineman (BURGER.BILL) got up and told 
stories about Joe.  Very interesting stories.  One thing I did glean from 
what they said, is that Joe's Worldwide Headquarter's needs a janitor REAL 
bad. :)  It was a good time, and over much too quickly.

     Later friday, back at the dorm, it was wonder around and visit again. 
 I did this, for a while, and being not too brilliant sometimes, had me a 
few brews.  I distinctly remember being in Ryan's room, visiting, and the 
next thing I remember is waking up in my bed.  I have no clue as to what 
happened.  Weird.  But, Kfest is like that, there is so much going on, so 
many people to visit, its hard to remember all.

     Unfortunately, I had to cut my attendance a bit short and had to 
leave Saturday.  I did get to the vendor fair, and promptly spent all my 
money.  Had just enough to buy gas for the trip home.  But, I was able to 
get some really neat things, and it was all worth the trip.  Well worth it.

     There were new product announcements, unfortuately, I was unable to 
see them.  I did get a preview of GUS, which I think is just wonderful.

     Well, that's my point of view. :) How 'bout you?

APPLE II FOREVER...NOW, MORE THAN EVER
                 (CAPTAIN.RON, CAT44, TOP6, MSG:23/M645;1)

>>>>>   A lot of neat things happened during Kfest '96, but here's my top
"""""   ten favorite moments of the festival.

     10.  Tim Kellers top ten list during the Joe Kohn Roast.  (Perhaps it 
will be uploaded here one of these days.  Hope so!)

     9.  The "Cheesehead" presentation to Kfest Big Cheese Cindy Adams.

     8.  Huddling with Richard Bennett and Dave Hecker about possible 
feature additions in the next version of GWIII 2.0

     7.  Steve Disbrow's creative way of waking up an unnamed Kfest 
attendee who dozed off during one of the afternoon sessions.  (I HAVE A 
QUESTION!!!!!!!)

     6.  Listening to Greg Templeman explain (or attempt to explain) the 
inner workings of his soon-to-be released GS movie player at 3 o'clock IN 
THE MORNING.   :)   I don't know what he was talking about, but it was fun 
seeing him try to get through to a non-techie type like me.  He was even 
drawing imaginary pictures on my door in an effort to make things clear.  
(Programmers ... gotta love 'em!)

     5.  The rather indelicate (but hilarious) manner in which Tony Diaz 
arranged two of Mike Westerfield's robots so that they chased each other in 
a circle around a table.  Describing this scene further would be too crude, 
but suffice it to say that you've never seen a mouse and a dinosaur behave 
in this fashion before.   :-)

     4.  Sheppy's demo of Wolfenstein 3D, during which he announced that 
the program would go into open beta testing on Genie in a few weeks, and 
that the long-awaited game would eventually be released as freeware!!

     3.  Ewen Wannop's compelling presentation about the Spectrum 2.1 
upgrade and his work in creating a new off-line message handler inside 
Spectrum itself.  When the message reader is finished, it will certainly be 
worth a "Crock 'O Gold"  :-)

     2.  Gary Utter's keynote address.  Truly inspiring.  A special moment 
of Kfest '96!!

     1a.  The announcement that dates had been reserved at Avila College 
for Kfest '97!!!!!!!!!!

     1.  The inaugural public showing of Gus, the IIGS emulator that will 
run on the Power Mac.  David Kerwood and Cindy Adams arranged this special 
showing by working closely with Apple developer Andy Nicholas.  The 
unveiling of "Gus"  was certainly the defining moment of Kfest '96.

     OK, those are are my highlights.  I'd love to hear others ....

<<<<<   Well, I'm home, somewhat rested, caught up on most of the laundry
"""""   my family saved for me, restocked the refrigerator, etc, so now I 
have a few minutes to post here.  KFest was great!!!!!  I have no 
hesitation in offering to organize next year's.  Now would be a good time 
to write the dates on your calendar ---- July 30 - August 3, 1997.  Those 
are the Wednesday to Sunday dates that we have the dorm reserved.  The 
Conference itself will be July 31 - August 2.

     I have to start out by thanking Tim Kellers, who I talked into 
helping by saying he "only had to take the money", and Steve Gozdziewski 
who did a fantastic job on getting all the sessions organized.  They both 
did a wonderful job, and made my job very easy.  I was able to catch them 
at the height of their sleep-deprivation period, and they agreed to help 
next year.  THANKS guys!

     As would be expected, there were a few minor glitches and problems.  
But certainly nothing we couldn't over come.  It is the people there that 
really make KFest the wonderful event that it is.  I know I'm still in awe 
of meeting some of the big names of the Apple II world.

     Getting to be part of the Gus demo was certainly a thrill for me.  
(read my post in the Gus topic)  Hanging out in the halls after hours, 
seeing other people's computer set up, trying to get the frisbee throwers 
to calm down, learning more about desktop publishing, finding out how 
better to use Netscape, etc, etc, are just a few of the things that will be 
a part of this year's wonderful experience.  Isn't it 1997 _YET_? :)

     I also have to thank everyone that was there, just for being there.  
And especially thanks to the presenters for giving KFest some credibility, 
so that it wasn't just one big party. :)  And of course, how could I forget 
to mention the presentation of the Cheesehead hat that Greg Betzel sent.

     I can hardly wait until next year!  Start planning on it now!!!

GUS--APPLE IIGS EMULATOR   Today, at KansasFest '96, David Kerwood and 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   Cindy Adams gave a presentation of GUS, an Apple 
IIGS emulator for the Mac.  GUS is a work in progress, and David and Cindy 
are among it's beta testers.  They were given permission by GUS's 
developers to beginning discussing it.

"""""   Andy has gone on record as saying that they hope to make a version 
that will run on both PowerPCs and regular Macs, but right now the 
PowerPC-equipped Mac or Mac clone is the only machine it will run on.  I've 
tested Gus on a PowerMac 8100/100 AV, the PowerBook 5300, and on a Mac IIsi 
with a Daystar PPC card (100 MHz).  Gus works fine on all three, and is 
downright ripping on the 8100.  Just as fast, if not faster, than my 11.5 
MHz IIgs at the house.

     This message was written and formatted on CoPilot v2.5.5, running on 
Gus.  The resulting a2.trt file was then exported to the Mac, where it was 
posted via ProTERM Mac.  If this gives anyone any ideas. :)  Gus also 
supports dragging and dropping of text from the Mac to itself, which the 
latest version of CoPilot Mac supports as well.  Gus does not allow for 
dragging and dropping of text from Gus to the Mac, which you would expect, 
but the IIgs clipboard can be exported to the Mac clipboard well enough.

SPECTRUM VERSION 2.1   I (Dave Hecker of Seven Hills) had a great time at 
""""""""""""""""""""   KansasFest.  It was nice to see past acquaintances, 
meet new friends, and FINALLY meet Ewen Wannop and Richard Bennett! :)  
Everyone should plan NOW to attend next year!

     At KansasFest we released "Spectrum Version 2.1 Update" on two 3.5" 
disks, with no printed documentation.  Word has already spread and we're 
being asked, "Can I order it now???"  The answer is YES!  However, because 
the printed documentation is not finished yet, and I won't be in town for 
the next two weeks, your order can't ship until I return (see below for 
shipping schedule).

     In addition to numerous improvements and fixes, we have (of course) 
included several new features.  Here are a few of the changes between 
version 2.0 and version 2.1:

+ Many new and enhanced XCMDs are included, giving scripts even more power.
+ File transfer settings have been split into two dialogs so separate send 
  and receive folders can be specified.
+ Includes great new !Help! NDA that we'll soon be releasing as freeware!
+ Supports new "menu item help" feature.
+ XCMDs can now customize Spectrum's menus...
+ The Kermit XCMD provides Kermit file transfer ability, and it integrates 
  right into Spectrum's Send and Receive menus, and into its File Transfer 
  menu!
+ Supports MacBinary wrappers to transfer files that have a resource fork.
+ Several new scripting commands and replacement items, including Make 
  CaseChange, Store Screen, Trigger strings, and others.
+ More!

     You can order now with a Visa/Mastercard/Discover card & expiration 
date via email or by phone (904-575-0566) or mail a check/money order to: 
Seven Hills Software, 2310 Oxford Road, Tallahassee, FL 32304.

CHECKWORKS FOR APPLEWORKS 5   Shareware Solutions II, in association with 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Dan Crutcher, is pleased to announce the 
release of CheckWorks 5, a complete and sophisticated Apple II based 
checking account program that works as a TimeOut module from within 
AppleWorks v5.x.

     With CheckWorks 5, users of AppleWorks v5 will be able to write and 
print checks, maintain a checkbook register, show current balances, and 
reconcile checking accounts without ever having to leave the friendly, 
familiar and integrated environment of AppleWorks Classic.

     Noted AppleWorks expert Dan Crutcher originally released CheckWorks 3 
as a shareware program for use with AppleWorks v3 (enhanced with 
UltraMacros 4).  After AppleWorks v4 was released by Quality Computers, 
CheckWorks 4 was enhanced, updated and released by Quality as a commercial 
add-on program for use with AppleWorks v4.

     At the current time, the complete CheckWorks package, available 
exclusively from Shareware Solutions II, includes the previously released 
CheckWorks 3 and CheckWorks 4, as well as CheckWorks 5.  No matter which 
version of AppleWorks you use, CheckWorks can help you organize and keep 
track of your checking accounts.

     The complete CheckWorks package is available from Shareware Solutions 
II for only $20, plus $3 additional for postage to anywhere in the world.

     Additionally, low cost upgrades are now available to owners of older 
versions of CheckWorks.  Those who use CheckWorks 3 for AppleWorks 3 can 
upgrade to CheckWorks 4/5 for only $10, plus $3 additional for postage to 
anywhere in the world.  Those who currently use CheckWorks 4 with 
AppleWorks 4 can upgrade to CheckWorks 5, for use with AppleWorks v5, for 
only $5 with no additional postage required.

     To receive the special upgrade pricing, you must return your original 
disk to Shareware Solutions II for verification.  That disk will be 
returned to you.

     CheckWorks 4 and 5 will work with AppleWorks v4 and v5 with no 
additional add-ons necessary.  CheckWorks 3, for use with AppleWorks v3, 
does require UltraMacros 4.  UltraMacros 4 may be purchased from Quality 
Computers.

     To order CheckWorks, make a check or money order payable to Joe Kohn, 
in US Funds only, and send it to:

COMPLETE STACK-CENTRAL/STUDIO CITY AND SCRIPT-CENTRAL ON CD   I guess I 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   dropped some 
hints before KansasFest about some new CD-ROMs from Shareware Solutions II.  
They were introduced at Kfest, and actually went on sale at Kfest.

     As you know, Shareware Solutions II has been distributing the 2 
hypermedia collections that had originally been published by 
Resource-Central (ICON).  Those collection....Stack-Central (aka Studio 
City) is a HyperStudio based collection, and Script-Central is a HyperCard 
IIGS based collection.

     It is those 2 collections that are now available on CD-ROM.

     Each CD-ROM disk contains a single HFS partition, and each collection 
is presented in 2 different formats.  One format contains disk images as 
they were originally shipped on 3.5" disk.  The second format is where the 
disks have been uncompressed and installed on the CD-ROM, all set to run.

     The HyperStudio collection represents 30 (2 disk) issues of Studio 
City, and that is still for sale, on 3.5" disk, for $120 plus $6 shipping 
and handling for US delivery (or $20 anywhere else).  The cost of the CD 
collection is $110, with no additional shipping and handling.

     The HyperCard collection represents 22 (2 disk) issues of 
Script-Central, and that is still for sale, on 3.5" disk, for $99 plus $6 
for shipping and handling for US delivery (or $10 to Canada/Mexico or $20 
anywhere else).  The cost of the CD collection is $89, with no additional 
shipping and handling.

     To order either collection (on CD-ROM or on 3.5" disk), send a 
check/money order in US Funds to:

          Joe Kohn
          166 Alpine St
          San Rafael, CA 94901-1008
          USA

     All CD-ROMs are shipped in a jewel case.

     There are Sampler Disks of both collections available for downloading 
from the Genie library.

SPELLING CHECKER IN A DESK ACCESSORY?   Well, let me try to answer a few 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   questions, and offer a few 
speculations.  Before I go too far, though, keep in mind that I'll be here 
sporadically this month.  I leave for HyperFest tomorrow, and can only 
cound on 48 hours at a modem for the next 3 weeks.

     The current spelling checker has these features:

      * 45,000+ word dictionary, with a 100,000+ word version comming soon
      * supports user dictionaries
      * makes sure words that are supposed to start with an uppercase 
        letter really do (e.g. Washington)
      * Insists on an uppercase letter after punctuation marks that 
        traditionally end a sentence ('.', ':', '!', '?'); this can be 
        disabled
      * Insists on proper spacing around punctuation marks; e.g. makes 
        sure there is no space before a comma and exactly one after; this 
        can also be disabled
      * Supports words with extended characters, like resume (with an 
        accent)
      * Optionally allows you to skip words with all uppercase letters or 
        words with letters and numbers (e.g. NDA, 3rd)
      * provides suggestions for unknown words when asked
      * knows what a number is (e.g., knows that 1e4 and 3.14159 are 
        numbers, not errors)

     Things it doesn't do:

      * Allow user editing of the main dictionary (you can edit the user 
        dictionary)
      * Allow selecting from multiple main dictionaries (but this is a 
        user interface issue.  It could be changed on the Apple IIGS)
      * Allow storing the dictionary in a user-selectable spot (but again, 
        this is easy enough to change)
      * Support Canadian/British/Australian spelling (but I'm willing to 
        create international versions.  Make that eager.)

     As for the interface, there are a variety of things I can think of to 
do on the Apple IIgs.  Doing all of them is too much for a short project, 
but I'd be interested in your preferences:

      * A command-line version for the ORCA shell.  This one would know 
        about Rez files and source file rules, and would check, say, a C 
        source file, intellegently checking strings and comments, and 
        perhaps identifiers, but not bugging you about "printf" all the 
        time.

      * A desktop program that could check a variety of file formats as a 
        post-processor.  This would work with ASCII files, and perhaps a 
        few other formats.

      * A background checker that looks at the keyboard.  I'm not sure how 
        well this would work in practice, but in theory it could warn you 
        about errors in anything, but it would be up to you to fix them 
        yourself in some situations.  This needs thought, but would be fun.  
        :)

      * What I thought you were looking for:  An NDA/CDA that would be 
        available to check spelling.  This could definitely check the 
        spelling of anything in the Scram Manager's text scrap.  That means 
        it would work with pretty much any desktop program, but you would 
        have to select the text, copy it, then invoke the spelling checker, 
        and paste the result back into the application.  I could probably 
        futz with TextEdit based applciations to check spelling in the 
        currently active TextEdit buffer, but this might not work as well 
        as you would think in all programs, since they have access to the 
        text edit data structures--and some programs make use of that 
        access in ways that might cause a spelling checker serious 
        problems.

     Besides allowing for the fact that I won't be around for timely 
responses, I want you to keep in mind that I'm thinking out loud.  Nothing 
here should be interpreted--for now anyway--as anything more that 
discussing some interresting possibilities.  I'm not (yet) commiting to any 
products.

     A few words about Gus, and more to follow...

     The demo of Gus at KansasFest '96 this past Saturday went off as 
planned, and for that we are very much in Apple's debt.  And specifically 
thanks has to go to Andy Nicholas, Dave Lyons, and Jim Murphy for their 
work, and to Andy for allowing us to proceed with the demo.  Also, as I 
thought it would be, Gus was the hit of the show.  Literally.  It was 
pretty near a SRO crowd in the AV room at Avila, at what turned out to be 
the last official event of the week's activities.  The reaction of the 
audience when Gus booted up in the monitor had to be seen to be 
appreciated.  Open-mouthed and dumbstruck would be putting it into a fair 
perspective.  Rumors of the upcoming demo had been flying fast and furious 
all week, and a few had thought that what was going to be displayed was the 
"Fast Eddie" IIgs emulator from Bright Software.  The sheer delight of the 
audience on actually seeing Gus was real, and working (mostly) was 
something to behold. :)

     This demo was a huge success, IN SPITE OF one individual taking it 
upon himself to do an informal demo of Gus to a few individuals in the 
cafeteria on Wednesday afternoon.  As a result, he received the 
richly-deserved disgust of many at KansasFest.

     Naturally, as you might expect, the questions were coming in before I 
even had a chance to shut my mouth.  The biggest one was "When?"  My stock 
reply to everyone (I must've been asked this several dozen times during the 
evening) was to have patience.  When Gus is available for download the 
location will be announced on the Gus Information Home Page that I had 
previously prepared at http://users.ids.net/~kerwood/gus.html.  The page 
has an automatic email registration 'bot that would send an email message 
when I had posted a location for downloading Gus from you.  I will also put 
up an additional (albeit identical) Gus Information Home Page on Cindy's 
server, and the address for that will be 
http://www.primenet.com/~adams/gus.html.

     The demo itself went fine.  Putting Gus through its paces was a piece 
of cake, and Gus handled everything just fine.  There were a few glitches, 
such as when Gus bombed on Cindy's machine (we were running Gus on two 
PowerBooks) while attempting to load up a game that accessed the Ensoniq 
chip (I think that's what happened).  One very interesting tidbit that I 
had told after the demo was that the people who were developing the latest 
update to one other highly regarded IIgs desktop application used Gus to 
compile the program.  They needed the speed. :)

     Gus has several parts that are incomplete.  Some of the biggest were 
Gus's inability to successfully emulate the Ensoniq chip, the total 
incompatibility between Seven Hills' Hierarchic and Gus, and an awkward 
interface between the Mac and the IIgs clipboard.  Everyone agreed however 
that the single biggest thing that needs to be implemented on the next 
version of Gus is the ability to access the serial port on a Mac.  
AppleTalk and printing aside, this is the only thing that really stands in 
the way of having a truly portable IIgs that can do telecommunications, 
which is highly desired in the Apple II world.

     As to the status of the NDAs that the Gus testers have signed, I am 
waiting for some clarification from Apple on that.  As soon as I find out, 
I'll let you know (you know who you are :)

     So, in short, the Gus Demo was a huge success, as far as I was 
concerned.  For that, and speaking for the organizers and participants in 
KansasFest '96, we are very grateful to the Gus development team for their 
efforts, and for their cooperation and understanding in allowing us to 
proceed last week.

The Computing Industry
""""""""""""""""""""""
by David C. Marriott
        [D.MARRIOTT]



                      >>> THE DISPOSABLE COMPUTER <<<
                      """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     I saw an interview on television with Bill Gates a few months ago, in 
which Gates began with the observation that he expected the average 
computer user to buy a new computer every three years.  I know that there 
are many people in the computer industry who will agree with that 
observation, and who will argue that it is justified, given the advances 
that are being made in computer hardware.

     However, it seems to me that the _needs_ of computer users, 
especially home users, are not changing that fast.  Most of us still use 
our computers for the same things that we used them for ten years ago: word 
processing, playing games, and visiting other computers online.  
Admittedly, the games on the market have more sophisticated graphics, and 
"going online" now means cruising the Internet, not just visiting a local 
BBS, but basically, the things we use our home computers for haven't 
changed dramatically.  The Apple II can do all those things.  You don't 
need 16 megabytes of memory and a 133 mHz processor to write a letter to 
your mother, or play a few hands of solitaire.

     We shouldn't be too surprised that the computer industry has adopted 
that attitude; it means that the public has to keep buying more and more 
computers.  After all, Apple and other hardware manufacturers are in the 
business of selling new computers.  Unfortunately, many software 
manufacturers have also accepted the dictum.  More and more computer owners 
are finding that the computers they bought two or three years ago won't run 
the software that's on the market today, without upgrading the memory, the 
processor speed, or the operating system.  I learned this lesson through 
personal experience.  I bought a Macintosh LCII in 1993.  I've had to add 
memory to it twice in the last three years, just to keep up with the 
current standards required by the software. Even so, I find there is a 
growing body of Macintosh software that my three-year-old computer can't 
use.

     What is surprising is that the computer-buying public has largely 
accepted this three-year rule.  Everyday, the classifieds are full of ads 
for almost new computers, being sold by owners who feel the need to 
upgrade.  Why are we so willing to accept such a short period of useful 
life from our computers?  We certainly wouldn't accept such obsolescence 
from any other appliance.  How would you react if you were buying a stereo, 
and the salesman told you that it wouldn't be able to play any new CDs or 
tapes in three years?  What would you think if the man at the furniture 
store told you that you'd have to replace your new refrigerator every few 
years?  Would you buy a car that didn't offer a three-year warranty?  Why 
then do we accept the notion that a computer, which is probably the most 
expensive single appliance in our home, should have a shelf life of only 
three years?

     That's why Apple has seemed so hostile to those of us who still own 
Apple IIs.  They want to sell us new machines, and we're still using the 
ones they sold us five or ten or fifteen years ago.  In 1983, Apple 
unveiled the slogan "Apple II Forever"; now, the people at Apple Inc. seem 
to find the longevity of their original computer is a source of 
embarrassment, even annoyance.

     Indeed, this may be where the average Apple II owner differs from 
other computer enthusiasts.  We have been looking for ways to make our 
machines do more for us, instead of looking to replace them.  Surprisingly, 
against all odds, we are succeeding.  In the past year, we've seen new 
morphing and facsimile programs published for the Apple II.  AppleWorks, 
and popular desktop publishing programs like Graphicwriter III continue to 
improve.  Shareware has flourished, filling the vacuum left by commercial 
publishers.  Apple II home pages and ftp sites populate the Internet, and 
we may even see a graphical web browser for the IIgs in the next few 
months.

     The computer industry is not the first to adopt the philosophy that a 
product should be replaced every three years.  In the 1950s and 60s, the 
American automobile industry had much the same approach.  The wealthy 
bought the latest model every three years, and those with less money were 
expected to snap up the used cars discarded by those who could afford new 
ones.  That attitude fostered another unfortunate view in the industry, 
that it really wasn't necessary to build a car with quality or durability, 
since the original owner wouldn't keep it, anyway.  As a result, the 
American automobile industry's reputation for workmanship dropped 
dramatically in the late 60s and 70s. We all know what happened then.  The 
Japanese auto manufacturers saw a need, and rushed to fill it.  By the 
1980s, American car manufacturers were asking their government to put 
import restrictions on Japanese cars, to allow them to recover the market 
they had lost.  For a complete history of the rise of the Japanese 
automobile industry, and the corresponding decline of the American 
automobile industry, read _The Reckoning_ by David Halberstam.  He makes 
the point that an industry cannot trade indefinitely on a product that is 
not built to last.

     Could the same thing happen in the computer industry?  Probably not.  
As noted above, the rapid development of new technology in the computer 
field offers some justification for the attitude that computers should be 
regularly replaced, apart from the greed of the computer manufacturers.  
But I can't help but feel that the first computer manufacturer who promises 
to build "the computer that you'll still be using five (or ten or fifteen) 
years" will find a very receptive market.  Wouldn't it be ironic if that

FROM THE PUBLISHER   Beagle Basic is a set of programs that let you enhance 
""""""""""""""""""   Applesoft and use new commands and features in your 
programs.  It also lets you rename standard commands and error messages, 
for whatever reason you might have.  Beagle Basic gets around Applesoft's 
"permanency" by moving it from ROM into RAM (Random-Access Memory) or 
changeable memory.

PD_Q COMMENTS   There was a time when being an Apple II owner meant being
"""""""""""""   an Apple II programmer, and when most Apple II programmers 
were BASIC programmers.  Programming wasn't a vocation, it was a hobby and 
a diversion.  I hope this explains why this file appears in the A2 
RoundTable instead of the A2Pro RoundTable, and why this article is 
appearing in GenieLamp A2 and not GenieLamp A2Pro.

     In the 1980s, improving on Applesoft BASIC was a small cottage 
industry.  Beagle Basic, Blankenship Basic, the Roger Wagner Publishing 
Toolbox series, Micol BASIC, AmperWorks, ZBasic, and ProBASIC were all 
available.  And that's not even touching on the Applesoft BASIC compilers 
or the IIgs BASICs.

     Beagle Basic was a fairly early entry in the field--it was designed 
for the original Apple II and Apple II+ with 64K, and updated for the IIe 
and IIc.  It wasn't really possible to update Beagle Basic _fully_ for:

     o  the 80-column screen;
     o  the Apple IIgs; nor
     o  ProDOS;

but many commands were translated to ProDOS (any Apple II, including the 
IIgs) by means of the & function.

     By copying Applesoft to RAM, Beagle Basic made certain changes 
possible:

     o  rename commands and error messages (CLEAR to WIPE, FORMULA TOO 
        COMPLEX to I'M CONFUSED);
     o  new commands and functions (ELSE, SWAP, TONE, HSCRN);
     o  enhancements to old functions (GOTO, GOSUB, LIST);
     o  named functions replacing awkward POKEs and CALLs; and
     o  goodies (better cursor, better beep);

     Beagle Basic also included a bonus utility that let you create your 
text screens using an editor and then automatically turned the screen into 
BASIC code.

     Beagle Basic is one of the few Beagle Bros disk archives that has a 
separate documentation file (#15857, B.BASIC.DOX.BXY).  Anyone who wants to 
learn how to use Beagle Basic should also download and read that file.  
What features are not covered by the documentation will be touched on in 
this article.


TECHNICAL STUFF   Beagle Basic is an archive of a DOS 3.3 diskette.  You 
"""""""""""""""   must unpack the archive to a blank (or expendable) 5.25" 
diskette.  You can't unpack it to your ProDOS hard drive or RAM disk.

     Beagle Basic requires 64K of memory.  Anyone with an Apple IIe, IIc 
or IIgs has at least this much memory.  It is intended for use with the 
40-column screen, and does not fully support 80 columns.


RENAMING COMMANDS   Why would you want to rename Applesoft commands?  You 
"""""""""""""""""   might want to change the names of commands to terms 
you're more familiar with--GOSUB to JSR, GOTO to JMP, HOME to CLS.  You 
might choose commands that make sense only to you so that other won't be 
able to understand your programs.  In their advertisments, Beagle Bros 
suggested that you might want to translate BASIC:

          10 POUR X = 10 A 20
          20 ECRIVEZ X;"BONJOUR"
          30 ENSUITE: FIN

     This can be misleading.  You have a maximum number of bytes to put 
all your commands in.  If you change FOR to POUR, you're adding a letter, 
so you have to make another command one letter shorter.  In our example,. 
this is accomplished in changing TO to A.  (I'm not sure what using A as a 
reserved word does to programs that use the variable A, nor even to 
programs that use AT.)  Changing END to FIN can be done with no loss of 
space, but changing PRINT to ECRIVEZ and NEXT to ENSUITE means that you 
have to subtract 5 letters from other commands.  Given the abbreviated 
nature of many of Applesoft's commands (DIM, GR, POS, REM), that's quite a 
task.  Translating BASIC from English to French isn't as easy as the sample 
makes it appear.

     In fact, while changing the names of Applesoft commands and functions 
might sound neat in theory, in practice it's not such a thrill unless 
you're the sort of person who thinks mugs with names printed on them make 
neat personalized gifts.  If you like customizing your programming 
environment, this feature of Beagle Basic will make you coo, but otherwise, 
it can leave you cold.


RENAMING ERROR MESSAGES   Much the same is true of customizing Applesoft 
"""""""""""""""""""""""   error messages.  An amusing novelty, but very 
little more.  You're limited here because "SYNTAX ERROR" is actually two 
messages, "SYNTAX", plus the "ERROR" message that follows all Applesoft 
errors.  With only the 6 letters of "SYNTAX" to work with, it's hard to 
turn "SYNTAX ERROR" into something more comprehensible to a beginner.

     Interestingly, the Beagle Bros DOS Boss disk, which offered the 
ability to change the name of DOS commands and error messages, should have 
been as frivolous, but wasn't.  Changing "CATALOG" to "CAT", "C", or "MENU" 
was actually fairly useful.  Perhaps this was because early Apple IIers 
typed DOS commands in immediate mode significantly more often than they 
typed BASIC commands in immediate mode.


NEW FUNCTIONS   Here we have the meat of the Beagle Basic package--it added 
"""""""""""""   new commands to Applesoft.  It made room for new commands 
by eliminating old ones... specifically, old ones that almost no one 
used--the cassette commands.  Once disk drives became widely available, 
their benefits were so obvious and exerted such a pull that loading 
programs from and saving data to tape became an arcane rite.  So Beagle 
captured SHLOAD, RECALL, STORE, LOAD, SAVE and other cassette commands and 
replaced them with ELSE, SWAP, TONE and others.

     It's important to note that the LOAD and SAVE pre-empted by Beagle 
Basic are the Applesoft commands, not the commands of the same name used by 
the disk operating system!  It's vital to be clear about this.  Beagle 
Basic also takes other Applesoft commands for which there DOS 
counterparts--PR# and IN#.  This seems a drastic step at first, but one has 
to remember that it was still possible to boot a disk with PR#6, because 
the DOS PR# command was still there.  While there's nothing wrong with 
this:

     10  PR# 3:  PRINT "80 COLUMNS"

it's more usual to see that line expressed like this:

     10  PRINT CHR$ (4);"PR#3": PRINT "80 COLUMNS"

In the former example, Applesoft is turning on the 80-column card.  In the 
latter, DOS is handling the task.

     Finally, Beagle Basic optionally took the lo-res graphics commands as 
well.  (If you had a program that used lo-res graphics, you had to do 
without a few minor enhancements.)  In fact, all the enhancements could be 
used or not used, as fitted your situation.

     The new functions made available in Beagle Basic were:

ELSE   This one command could almost justify the entire package.  Many 
''''   other BASICs have the ELSE command to supplement IF and THEN, for 
the very good reason that such a command is useful!  ELSE would be 
indispensable for anything who wanted to convert a "generic" BASIC listing 
to Applesoft.  It's possible to do a poor simulation of ELSE with standard 
Applesoft, but the simulation makes the flow of the code hard to follow.

SWAP   This command exchanges the values of two variables.  This can be 
''''   done in Applesoft by bringing a third variable into use:

     10  TEMP=X: X=Y: Y=TEMP

This workaround is a little less quick and a little less elegant... but not 
much.

TONE   This command or one very much like it seems to turn up in most 
''''   Applesoft enhancements--for the very good reason that getting sound 
out of an Apple II is not an easy task for a beginning BASIC programmer.  
Well worth having.

HSCRN   Lo-res graphics have a command called SCRN, which tells you the 
'''''   color of any given square on the graphics screen.  HSCRN does 
something very similar, except for the purposes of HSCRN, there are just 
two hi-res colors, black and white.  Still, this is enough for HSCRN to be 
useful in detecting hi-res "collisions".  Programming arcade games in BASIC 
is hard enough, but Applesoft's lack of a HSCRN makes it worse.

SCRLDN   A decidely useful text screen command that allows you to scroll 
''''''   text to the bottom of the screen.  (Scrolling up is not a problem.  
Display your text and then add enough PRINT statements so that it scrolls 
to the top.)  I was amused to note that the Beagle Basic demo claims that 
this is not normally possible in Applesoft, yet demonstrates the technique 
despite the fact that the demo program does _not_ require Beagle Basic.  
Suffice it to say that it's possible to get this effect without a SCRLDN 
command, but that it's a lot of work.

TXT2   A command to let you use text page 2, which is normally inaccessible 
''''   except through plenty of jiggery-pokery.  As I wrote very 
text-intensive programs, this would have been very useful to me if I had 
been introduced to it early enough.

G2   Similar to TXT2, this lets you access page 2 of the lo-res graphics 
''   screen.  Not likely to be as useful, since lo-res graphics are now 
considered the poor relatives of the Apple II graphic format family.


ENHANCED FUNCTIONS   These are not new commands, but improvements in the
""""""""""""""""""   way that existing commands work.

GOTO and GOSUB   Beagle Basic made two valuable contributions to the way 
''''''''''''''   GOTO and GOSUB operate.  First, it made it possible to 
GOTO/GOSUB a variable, as in GOTO START or GOSUB KEYPRESS.  This makes for 
programs that are significantly easier to write and read--the logic is more 
readily apparent.  Second, it made it possible to GOTO/GOSUB an expression 
such as GOSUB I * 100 or GOTO ((NAME$="GENIELAMP") * 10) + 100.  Integer 
BASIC used to let you do this, and it's nice to have it return.

LIST   This command was not changed in terms of the parameters it can take, 
''''   but in terms of its display.  First, Beagle Basic REM statements can 
appear in inverse.  This technique of making remarks stand out is very 
valuable, and was pretty generally adopted once Apple's 80-column cards 
became widely available.

     Second, Beagle Basic's listing can have any width and indentation the 
programmer wishes.  This means it's possible to have listing which stretch 
right across to the 40th column (instead of stopping at column 33), which 
in turn means that tracing over code is much easier.

Bell   Beagle Basic also lets you change the tone that you hear whenever
''''   the standard control-G bell is heard.  (Under ProDOS, this true for
the & BELL command only.)


ALIASES FOR FUNCTIONS   People who programmed Applesoft BASIC eventually 
"""""""""""""""""""""   learned that there were "secret" routines built 
into their Apple II that could be called from BASIC, but only if you knew 
the code number.  For example, under DOS 3.3, POKE 49384,0 starts the drive 
motor, and POKE 49285,0 stops it.  Beagle Bros were one of the great 
crusaders in making this "secret" information generally available by means 
of their Peeks, Pokes, and Pointers charts, issued free with every disk 
they sold.

     Still, some POKEs and CALLs were used so frequently that even looking 
them up on the chart became a hassle.  So Beagle Bros took a bunch of the 
most popular commands and create English translations for them, which were 
much easier to remember.

BELL      CALL -198           rings the Apple's bell
          (or PRINT CHR$(7))

SCRLUP    CALL -912           scrolls screen up one line
          (or PRINT)

CLRKEY    POKE -16388, 0      clear keyboard buffer

CLLN      CALL -868           clear text screen from cursor to right margin
CLDN      CALL -958           clear text screen from cursor to bottom

CRSU      CALL -998           move cursor up one line
CRSD      CALL -922           move cursor down one line
CRSL      CALL -1008          move cursor left one character
CRSR      CALL -1036          move cursor right one character

MODE1     POKE -16304, 0      graphics display
MODE2     POKE -16303, 0      text display
MIX0      POKE -16302, 0      split-screen (graphics and text window)
MIX1      POKE -16301, 0      full-screen graphics (no text)
PAGE1     POKE -16300, 0      page 1
PAGE2     POKE -16299, 0      page 2
RESL1     POKE -16298, 0      lo-res graphics
RESL2     POKE -16297, 0      hi-res graphics

     All these commands are a great convenience, but not more.  They don't 
add much to the value of Beagle Basic.


BONUS:  TEXT SCREEN FORMATTER   (This utility works independantly of Beagle 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Basic.  Karl Bunker has written a similar 
utility for ProDOS called SCLU, which works in a slightly different 
fashion.)

     Any utility that lets you type your text on the screen without having 
to worry about how to code it is a godsend.  The only caveat is that such a 
utility doesn't always pick the most efficient method.  If you have a 
dividing line of equal signs, it's considerably more memory efficient to 
use FOR LOOP = 1 TO 40: PRINT "=";: NEXT LOOP than it is to write PRINT 
"=======================================".

     Unfortunately, there is documentation on how to use either the 40- or 
80-column version of this bonus utility.  Fortunately, GenieLamp A2 is here 
to save you the time and trouble:

     To start either utility, you can either BRUN or BLOAD it, depending 
on your preference.  Even if you BRUN it, nothing will happen.  You must 
CALL 25000 to start the utility running.  Be sure you are already in 40 
columns if using the 40-column version; same for the 80-column version.

     Once the utility has started, there are no instructions and there is 
no help command, so keep this chart handy:

     control-A or up-arrow    move cursor up one line
     control-Z or down-arrow  move cursor down one line
     right-arrow              move cursor right one character
     left-arrow               move cursor left one character

     control-E      scroll text up one line
     control-X      scroll text down one line
     control-S      scroll text right one character
     control-D      scroll text left one character

     control-I      inverse text mode
     control-N      normal text mode
     control-F      flashing text mode (MouseText in 80 columns)

     control-@      clear entire page
     control-L      clear to end of line
     control-P      clear to end of page

     control-C      center text

     control-O      (40-columns only) print ], ^, and @ characters
     Escape         (40-columns only) toggle upper and lower case

     control-W      framing window on/off

     control-Q      quit utility and translate screen layout into BASIC

     If you'd like to continue working on a screen after you've RUN it, 
you can begin again _without_ clearing the screen by typing CALL 25003 
instead of CALL 25000.  It might be best to make the last line in your 
program CALL 25003.

     The first time you press control-Q, this utility starts creating the 
necessary program lines, starting at line number 10, and increasing the 
line numbers by 10 for each line.  The next time you CALL the utility, it 
will start just beyond whatever line number you left off.  (If your last 
line number was 80, the first line number for the second try will be 90.)  
If you'd like to change the starting line number and increment, assign 
values to the variables START and INC--right from the command line; you 
don't have to put them in a program--and use these POKEs:

     POKE 25006, START - INT(START/256) * 256
     POKE 25007, INT(START/256)
     POLE 25008, INC


KEEPING UP TO DATE   As mentioned, Beagle Basic was written for the 
""""""""""""""""""   original Apple II and Apple II+, and is only 100% 
compatible with those two machines.  If you have an Apple IIe (either 
enhanced or not) or an Apple IIc, then you can only have access to all 
Beagle Basic features if you modify the Beagle programs slightly so that 
they will fool your Apple IIe or IIc into thinking that it is an earlier 
model Apple II.

     If you do not want to fool your Apple II or IIc, then you will be 
limited to altering the names of Applesoft commands and functions, and 
Applesoft error messages.  You cannot use the extra commands in your 
programs.

     You cannot fool your Apple IIgs into thinking it is an earlier model 
Apple II, so it would seem at first glance that IIgs users cannot use any 
part of Beagle Basic whatsoever.  In fact, you can, but you have to make a 
small memory sacrifice (1-2K) to do so.

Ampersand Disadvantages   Beagle has provided ampersand versions of its 
'''''''''''''''''''''''   commands, both for DOS 3.3 and ProDOS.  This is 
slightly more awkward, especially in the case of the ELSE command, now the 
& ELSE command.  The old syntax was simple:

      100  IF I < 1 THEN  PRINT "a" : ELSE PRINT "some"

The new syntax requires you to use IF with THEN, as always, but & IF with & 
ELSE.  (There's no such thing as & THEN.)  If you try to use IF with & 
ELSE, it won't work.  So use this:

      100  & IF I < 1 THEN  PRINT "a" : & ELSE PRINT "some"

not this:

      100  IF I < 1 THEN  PRINT "a" : & ELSE PRINT "some"

This means that you're going to have to keep your eyes peeled for the 
correct syntax.  Who needs hassles like that?

     The syntax of the hi-res command has changed and is slightly more 
awkward.  PAGE1 has simple syntax; & PAGE (1) gives you one more change to 
forget exactly the right way to type the command.

     Two commands have disappeared from the ampersand version--TXT2 and G2 
are gone.

     With the original Beagle Basic, you could chose which new commands 
you wanted active.  Now, you must have all of them or nothing.

     & LIST and & BELL now require complicated POKEs to make them work.  
Since you can access these features directly, power users will like the 
POKEs, but beginners will be intimidated and curse a lot, since it's one 
more thing to look up.

Ampersand Advantages   With original Beagle Basic, you originally had to 
''''''''''''''''''''   choose one of three groups of four commands:

     o  CLLN, CLDN, SCRLUP, and BELL
     o  MODE, MIX, PAGE, and RESL
     o  CRSU, CRSD, CRSL, and CRSR

That is, if you had the hi-res commands (second group), then you had to do 
without the cursor-move commands (third group).  With the ampersand 
versions, you can have all the commands.

     There is one new command in the ampersand version:  & RDKEY (A), 
which compliments & CLRKEY.

     It's now possible to use the 80-column screen with many of the 
commands.  Exception are & SCRLUP and & SCRLDN, which will crash if you try 
to use them with the 80-column screen active, and & CRSU, & CRSD, & CRSL, 
and & CRSR don't cause a crash, which is good, but they don't all work 
properly either, which is bad.  Give all these commands a miss in 80-column 
mode.

     & TONE and & HSCRN work okay, but they parse a bit oddly, since they 
both contain BASIC-reserved words, TO and SCRN.  This means that listings 
will show & TO NE (25, 75) and & H SCRN (0, 0), which looks odd, to say the 
least.


LEGAL STUFF   Beagle Basic is one of a series of disk archives from the old 
"""""""""""   Beagle Bros catalogs.  These disk used to be available 
commercially, but circa 1991, Beagle made them available freely on three 
understandings:

     (1) despite the fact that they were free, Beagle still owned them;
     (2) despite the fact that Beagle owned them, they didn't support them;
     (3) despite the fact that you could own them for nothing, you had to 
         pay Beagle if you used them commercially (that is, made any money 
         from their free software)

     Beagle wasn't happy about the idea of their freebie disks showing up 
on bulletin boards and networks--Genie was an exception.  (I know GenieLamp 
A2 has lots of subscribers who don't subscribe to Genie, so I'll mention 
this now:  Please don't write me asking me to send you a copy of Beagle 
Basic.  I can't.  If you come to Genie, you'll be able to download a copy.  
If you can download a copy somewhere else, it's probably illegal.)


SUMMING UP   There are times when I feel I shouldn't be making an overall 
""""""""""   recommendation, and this is one of them.  If you've read this 
column, you should have the necessary information to determine if Beagle 
Basic is right for you.  I find that I can't make a general recommendation 
for all Apple II computer users.

     If you have an old Apple II with 64K and have no 80-column card and 
don't mind using DOS 3.3 only, you can use all the features that Beagle 
Basic promises.

     If you have an Apple IIe or IIc, you can limit yourself to DOS 3.3 
and customize BASIC to your heart's content.  If you can also limit 
yourself to 40-columns, you can also have extra commands without having to 
mess with &.  Or you can have the commands too, if you don't mind messing 
with &, in either ProDOS or DOS 3.3.

     If you have an Apple IIgs, then the only way you can use Beagle Basic 
is by using either the DOS 3.3 or ProDOS ampersand package.  Keep in mind 
that most ampersand commands work with 80-columns, but there are a few that 
don't.

     The most valuable parts of Beagle Basic are five commands:  ELSE, 
SWAP, TONE, SCRLDN and HSCRN.  The ability to use variable in GOTO and 
GOSUB is also valuable.  As a BASIC enhancer, Beagle Basic doesn't rate 
particularly high, because of the features it misses out on--where are 
WHILE/WEND and REPEAT/UNTIL loops?  What about & MID$, which allows you 
overwrite a portion of a string with another string?  What about & SEARCH, 
which searches for a substring within a string?  What about & TIME and & 
DATE?  What about & ERASE for erasing and removing arrays?  There are so 
many possible improvements to Applesoft that could have been made.  Beagle 
Basic may have been innovative for its time, but by today's standards, it 
seems just a little backward.

     Still, if you're just beginning to learn BASIC programming, then you 
may find that Beagle Basic will make life easier for you.  If you been 
looking for a way to use ELSE or HSCRN in your programs, you could do worse

Top 10 Files for June
"""""""""""""""""""""

    [EDITOR.A2]



     This feature lists the ten most popular files for the month.  To give 
files a chance to seek their own levels, no files will be added to the list 
until they've been in place at least a month.  This month, we look at the 
files uploaded 1-30 June 1996.

     This isn't the Academy Awards ceremony, folks; it's more like the 
People's Choice Awards (both of which are trademarked, by the way).  The 
Top 10 doesn't necessarily tell you what's new and interesting--what files 
_you_ might find interesting--it simply tells you what files have been 
downloaded a lot--what other people found interesting!

     I was pretty pressed for time this month, so the long descriptions of 
the files have been omitted.  If you miss them, I hope you'll write and say 
so.  Either way, they should be back next month.

     I've treated QUICKIES.BXY, QUICKIES2.BXY and QUICKIES3.BXY as one 
file, so there 12 files in this month's list as a result.

New Files From Old
""""""""""""""""""

    [EDITOR.A2]



     Welcome to the File Mechanic.  In this new column, we focus on files 
in the Genie library that can be improved or updated.  We'll give you the 
exact steps necessary to make the recommended changes.

     This month, we focus on a file that I began modifying simply to 
update it.  While doing that, I found some code that didn't work right.

                                 [*][*][*]


          Program name:    Gillian's Bunny Game
          Filename:        BUNNY.GAME.BXY
          Program type:    BASIC program
          Program number:  17118
          File size:       14,336 bytes
          Author:          unknown (originally uploaded by T.DAWSON)

     Gillian's Bunny Game is a game written by a father for his 
two-year-old daughter.  A rabbit and carrot are drawn in separate places on 
the hi-res screen.  The player uses the arrow keys to move the rabbit to 
the carrot.  When the rabbit reaches the carrot, the player gets a point 
and starts again.  Once a certain number of carrots have been eaten, a 
farmer will appear and chase the rabbit.  If the farmer catches three 
rabbits, the game is over.

     This game is tremendously simple to play.  The author (not identified 
in the program or its documentation) wrote it because his daughter found a 
simple maze game on the "Apple presents..." disk too difficult.  You should 
bear this in mind before you download the file--let alone before you modify 
it.  This is a game for very young children.

     This program will run on any Apple II, including the IIgs, without 
modification.  My modifications make for slightly better play on any Apple 
II that can generate lower case key presses and proper speed on an Apple 
IIgs.  They also fix a minor bug in the program.

     The documentation that accompanies the program has a section on 
modifying the game.  This was not as helpful as was intended as many of the 
line numbers referred to are no longer there.  I suspect that a program 
"compacter" (such as COMPACT on the Beagle Bros' D Code disk) was used on 
the program.  The range of the line numbers given by the author seems 
correct, but in many cases the lines themselves have disappeared as a 
result of their having been combined with other lines.

     We will be using subroutines to improve the lower case and speed 
handling of the program.  We'll place these frequently-called subroutines 
at the beginning of the program (a good habit to get into).

     The program as written starts at line 20.  We'll put our subroutines 
before line 20, and use a GOTO at the very start of the program to hop over 
the subroutines:

     1  GOTO 20

     Our first two subroutines handle the speed of the Apple IIgs.  A 
stock, unaccelerated IIgs has two settings, Fast and Normal.  (Apple must 
have considered "Normal" a more encouraging term than "Slow".  Fast food 
places don't have a size for french fry orders smaller than "regular" any 
more, either.  Advertising types won't let us use "small, medium, or large" 
any more.  Heaven spare us.)  You can change the speed of your IIgs from 
BASIC by changing the contents memory location 49206.  This memory location 
stores other important information, so we have to be a little careful about 
how we change the contents.

     (If your IIgs is accelerated with a ZipGS card, then you can set its 
"CPS Follow" option to On.  Then the ZipGS will obey the instructions in 
our modifications.)

     Before we write the subroutines, we need a little code in the main 
program that checks that the program is running on an Apple IIgs.  The 
official way to do this involves a short assembly language routine, 
documented in Apple II Miscellaneous Tech Note #7.

     Here, we POKE this routine into memory, call it, and then examine the 
results.  My method of poking the routine into memory uses a string 
containing the values to be poked.  Such routines often use DATA 
statements, but I prefer this method, as it adapts more easily to programs 
that already use DATA statements in their own code.

 150 ROUT% = 768:W1 = 80:W2 = ROUT% - 1:A$ = 
"05603203125417600214400616200814202300309616901615702300314002500309600000
0000000"
 155  FOR L1 = 1 TO W1 STEP 3:W2 = W2 + 1:B$ =  MID$ (A$,L1,3):W3 =  VAL 
(B$): POKE W2,W3: NEXT L1
 160  CALL ROUT%: IF PEEK (ROUT% + 23) = 16 THEN IIGS% = 1

     We will place the short assembly routine--longer than it needs to be, 
since it also returns the ROM version of a IIgs, which is not relevant to 
this program--at location 768 ($300 in hexadecimal) and then CALL it.  We 
split the long string containing 80 values into 3-character strings, and 
POKE the value of the 3-character string into each successive memory 
location.  Once the routine is available, we CALL it and see if the Apple 
II running the program has a 16-bit processor (Apple IIgs only) or an 8-bit 
one (all other Apple IIs).

     Once we know the program is running on an Apple IIgs, we can safely 
change the memory location that contains the speed.  We will need to slow 
down the IIgs and of course speed it back up as well.  First, the simple 
subroutine that slows down:

 5  IF IIGS% = 1 THEN W1% =  PEEK (49206): IF W1% > 127 THEN  POKE 
49206,W1% - 128: REM slow down GS
 6  RETURN

     That is, if we have a IIgs, then check memory location 49206.  If 
it's not already slowed down, slow it down now.  We use the sample code 
with the logic reversed to speed up again:

 10  IF IIGS% = 1 THEN W1% =  PEEK (49206): IF W1% < 128 THEN  POKE 
49206,W1% + 128: REM speed up GS
 11  RETURN

     Now that we have the ability to slow down the IIgs and speed it up, 
we have to consider when to do so.  In some programs, it's best to slow 
down a IIgs as the program starts and speed it up again just before the 
program ends.  In this case, most of the program could do with a little 
speeding up.  The exception are the "win" and "lose" routines.  These go by 
too quickly on a IIgs.  That being the case, we'll slow down immediately 
before the bunny getting a carrot and speed up afterward.  Same procedure 
for when the farmer gets the bunny.

     First, change line 1080 to slow down the program just before the 
bunny gets the carrot:

 1080  IF D = 1 AND I THEN  GOSUB 5: CALL 866: GOTO 1100

The only change here is that we've inserted "GOSUB 5" (slow down) before 
"CALL 866".  Now let's remember to speed things up once the bunny has done 
its dance of joy:

 1120  NEXT D,P:K = K + 1: DRAW J AT C,E: DRAW D AT X,Y: GOSUB 10: GOTO 
1380

Again, a simple change--"GOSUB 10" (speed up) inserted before "GOTO 1380".

     When we slow down before the "bunny caught" routine and speed up 
after, we can make both adjustments on the same line:

 1200  HCOLOR= 0: DRAW D AT X,Y: HCOLOR= 3: DRAW J AT C,E: VTAB 24: CALL  - 
868: HTAB 5: PRINT "The Farmer caught the Bunny!";: FOR B = 1 TO 11: POKE 
864,B(B): POKE 865,A(B): IF I THEN  GOSUB 5: CALL 866: GOSUB 10: GOTO 1300

We've put "GOSUB 5" (slow down) before "CALL 866" and "GOSUB 10" (speed up) 
right after it.  These are the only times we need to change the speed of 
the Apple IIgs for the entire program.

     Gillian's Bunny Game allows for play on an original Apple II or Apple 
II+ by letting you use the I-J-K-M diamond to move the bunny.  (Later 
computers can also use the arrow keys.)  Instead of checking for lower case 
input (i-j-k-m), however, the program merely admonishes you to keep the 
Caps Lock key down.

     It would be simple enough to add a few lines of code to check for 
lower case input, but we're going to do something even simpler--convert 
each lower case key press into upper case.  This short subroutine does the 
job:

 14 W1$ = "": FOR W1 = 1 TO  LEN (A$):W2 =  ASC ( RIGHT$ (A$,( LEN (A$) + 
1) - W1)):W2$ =  CHR$ (W2 - 32 * (W2 > 96 AND W2 < 123)):W1$ = W1$ + W2$: 
NEXT W1:A$ = W1$: RETURN

In this program, the length of the string to convert (A$) is always one, 
but this routine can be used for longer strings as well.

     Now that we have the routine, we need to call it (almost) every time 
the program looks for keyboard input--in practice, every time the 
programmer used "GET A$", we need to put "GOSUB 14" immediately afterward.  
Here are the lines to change:

 520  LET A$ = "": POKE  - 16368,0: GET A$: GOSUB 14:A =  ASC (A$): IF A = 
27 THEN 2540

 2140  VTAB 12: HTAB 1: CALL  - 958: PRINT "Do you want instructions? (Y/N) 
-->";: GET A$: GOSUB 14: PRINT A$: IF A$ = "N" THEN  RETURN

 2910  HTAB 14: CALL  - 868: PRINT "Play again? ";: GET A$: GOSUB 14: IF A$ 
= "Y" THEN  CLEAR : GOTO 140

     With lower case taken care of, let's fix a tiny slip that the 
programmer made.  He tries to make sure that messages about Caps Lock keys 
and arrow keys are printed only if the program is not running on an 
original Apple II or Apple II+.  Unfortunately, he uses a non-standard PEEK 
to check this.

     I suspect that the author got this unsupported PEEK from Beagle 
Bros--it appears in their Tip Book #7 (distributed with GPLE) and on their 
Silicon Salad disk.  Where Beagle Bros got it from, I don't know.  Beagle 
Bros were a great source of really nifty tips.  Most of them broke the 
rules and it doesn't seem to matter.  A few of them--like this one--broke 
the rules and it matters immensely.  Once the IIgs came out, all bets were 
off.

     Fortunately, this is simple to fix.  We just replace the unofficial 
PEEK with the official one (from Apple II Miscellaneous Tech Note #7).  The 
first line we can change like this:

 2040  HOME : VTAB 3: IF  PEEK (64435) <  > 6 THEN 2080

     This causes the program to check for an Apple II with a Caps Lock key 
and skip this line if the Apple II is an older model with no such key:

 2060  HTAB 3: PRINT " Be sure <CAPS LOCK> key is down "

     Wait a minute!  We've already changed the program so that the Caps 
Lock key does _not_ have to be pressed any longer.  Line 2060 is now 
redundant... but it doesn't really do any harm.  You can choose to keep the 
redundant line in there, or you make these simple changes:

2040  HOME
2060  REM

     The next time the program checks up on the sort of Apple II being 
used is when the game instructions mention the four arrow keys.  Unlike the 
example above, we can't just skip this change; we must make it!  The 
program doesn't print the message about four arrow keys if it's running on 
an original Apple II or Apple II+.  Again, we just need to change the PEEK 
(and value being checked):

 2180  HOME : POKE 33,35: POKE 32,5: PRINT : PRINT "Move the bunny to eat 
carrots": PRINT "=============================": VTAB 6: PRINT "       I": 
PRINT " use  J K  to move the bunny": PRINT "       M": PRINT : PRINT : IF  
PEEK (64435) = 6 THEN  PRINT " or use the four arrow keys": PRINT : PRINT 

     (As the programmer originally had it, the message about the four 
arrow keys was not appearing when it should have, giving the impression 
that all players had to use the I-J-K-M group of keys.)

     That's all you really need to do!  I'll give you a couple more 
modifications for Apple IIgs users who are launching the game from the 
Finder.  They're by no means necessary, but they might make life a little 
easier.  They'll also work with an 8-bit program launcher, so you can use 
them even if you don't have an Apple IIgs.

     The first change goes right before the loading of the games' shapes 
(line 20).  All this change does is find out what the prefix of the game 
is, and sets the active prefix there.  If you didn't understand a word of 
that, don't worry.  This line is pretty harmless, so include it anyway.

 15  PRINT  CHR$ (4)"PREFIX": INPUT P$: PRINT  CHR$ (4)"PREFIX";P$

     We also need to make a small change to the first line we created so 
that it reads:

     1  GOTO 15

since our program begins a bit earlier than it used to.

     The second change has two parts.  The game as written simply ENDs... 
that is, uses the BASIC END statement.  You might find it more useful to 
issue a ProDOS "BYE" command instead.  This will take you back to the 
Finder, or whatever program you used to launch BUNNY.GAME.  Begin by 
removing the END statement from the end of line 2940, so it looks like 
this:

 2940  TEXT : HOME : PRINT "Bye...": VTAB 23: FOR B = 1 TO 23: HTAB 24 - B: 
VTAB B: PRINT "]";: FOR L = 1 TO 50: NEXT : PRINT  CHR$ (8);" ";: POKE 
864,8: POKE 865,2: CALL 866: NEXT : PRINT

     Also, just before the end, we issue a GOSUB 10, which speeds up an 
Apple IIgs.  This is absolutely redundant--every time we slow down, we are 
careful to speed up again when finished--but you might want to do it 
anyway.  It's a little like bearing a belt and suspenders, but go ahead if 
it will make you feel safer:

 2950  GOSUB 10: PRINT  CHR$ (4);"BYE"

     Finally, if you like, you can put a "GOSUB 5" at the beginning of 
line 2940, so that it slows down the goodbye routine slightly.  This is 
very much a matter of personal taste, so try it both ways.  If you _do_ use 
the GOSUB and slower goodbye routine, be sure to use the GOSUB 10 in line 
2950

     If you don't care about double-locking your door and you did _not_ 
slow down the goodbye routine in line 2940, try just:

 2950  PRINT  CHR$ (4);"BYE"

                                 [*][*][*]


     That's all for this month.  This column won't be a regular feature of 
GenieLamp A2; it will just run when someone on staff finds files in the 
Genie A2 RoundTable library that could stand some updating or fixing.  Or, 
if no one writes to say they found it useful or enjoyed it, it might never 
run again.
