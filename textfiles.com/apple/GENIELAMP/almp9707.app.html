                            >>>IN THIS LIFE<<<
                            """"""""""""""""""

     I'm tired.  This happens every summer.  It's been a million years
since the last time I talked--really talked, not electronically chatted in
a virtual room--about computers to someone who wasn't a world away in terms
of philosophy.  Yet I end every summer invigorated and full of enthusiasm
to continue doing what I can to keep the Apple II alive.

     The reason is simple: KansasFest.

     KansasFest is the absolute most fun an Apple II fanatic can have.
I'll guarantee that if you show up at Avila College in Kansas City,
Missouri on the 30th of July, and stay a few days and (sleepless) nights,
your computing life will be changed forever.

     In continuing our theme of monthly KansasFest Blatant Plugs, this
month we feature an update of Doug Cuff's highly acclaimed "Accidental
Tourist's Guide to KansasFest," which is absolutely required reading for
the first time KFester, and recommending reading for everyone else.

     I'll see you all at Avila College in a couple of weeks.

                                [*] [*] [*]


     The big news this month as far as the Genie A2 and A2Pro RoundTables
go is that they're now merged!  Both Apple II users and programmers alike
can now do all of their Apple II Genie work from a single Genie page number
(645).  Many more details about the merger are included in this issue.

     Unfortunately, the merger was not without its growing pains.  Several
people were hit with many old messages moved to new locations that they may
have read years ago.  But the worst is behind us, and I think we can look
forward to both A2 and A2Pro working hard together to make the Apple II
Community even stronger.

                                [*] [*] [*]


     This month's edition of _GenieLamp A2_ is created in memory of Israel
Kamakawiwo'ole, the voice of modern Hawai'ian music, who died on June 26,
1997 of complications from morbid obesity.  You are missed, Bruddah Iz.

This may be old hat to some, but I'm watching THE DEAD ZONE at the moment,

with a Monitor ///. I assume it's a II Plus, given the Monitor ///.

Gee, that brings back memories. My first II was a 48K II Plus with a black
& white Monitor ///, two Disk II drives, a Videx(?) lowercase chip, Videx
keyboard enhancer, Videx 80-column card, and a genyoowine _Microsoft_ 16K
card in Slot 0, giving me a massive 64K of RAM. How I wish I wish I still

prevents me from posting verbatim the fascinating little blurb that ended
last week's Mac the Knife column in MacWeek, that gave a wacky description
of Gus being demonstrated running under Rhapsody at the recent Apple
Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose. The Gus development team came
out of the closet, in other words...

If you want to see what I mean, you can find it on the web at this url:

Curiously enough, the column is both SIS and Lynx-friendly.  :)

<<<<<   Well, I recieved confirmation from Andy Nicholas, and Gus was
"""""   indeed featured during the Rhapsody Blue Box session at the recent
Apple World Wide Developers Conference a few weeks ago in San Jose. The
webcast of the event is still available, and you can point your browser at
this url to see it:

http://wwdc.smgtv.net/session204.html

For those of you who don't have the hardware to see a webcast, what was
happening was that the Rhapsody team at WWDC was demonstrating various
parts of the Mac OS running under the "blue box." They were showing
Quicktime movie clips and demonstrating how this, that, and the other s
yearthing still works, and then decided to drop into something completely
different. The hall (good crowd) broke into cheers and applause when the GS
OS boot screen then appeared on the Rhapsody/Mac desktop, and then played a
few minutes of Choplifter for all assembled. It was, even to my jaded eye,
pretty cool. :)

If you are able to tune into the webcast, then the Gus portion of it occurs
about halfway through the webcast. Move the slider to the half tick mark,
and if you've gotten to the Q&A portion of the session, you've gone too
far. The Gus appearance was what they used to wind up the demo before going
into the question and answer period. But don't put it off, it won't be
available for much longer.

            SISTERS FROM THE START, SOON TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN!

For some time now we've been thinking about merging the A2 and A2Pro RTs,
and now seems to be a good time to take that step.

By merging them into one Apple II RoundTable we make it easier for you to
get your hardware, software, and programming questions answered all in one
place. In the process, we get to streamline the A2 area, and make it a
better place for all of us.

To accomplish this, some major changes in the organization of the A2
bulletin board and libraries will be necessary. Just as soon as we have the
details worked out, we will share them with you right here.

With any task as complex as this, there are bound to be a few problems, and

SEVEN HILLS, SPECTRUM, AND SIS   Today I tried to call an order in for
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Spectrum v2.1 and SIS but when I started
to leave the information on the system, I never got to complete it.  I was
going to EMail them but I don't have a "warm fuzzy" feeling when it comes
to giving my credit card no..  Any suggestions (other than snail mail)?  Or
did I hit the wrong button on the phone when I connected?

Thanks for your response.

"""""
I would suggest that you try again tomorrow on the phone and see if you get
better results. Or ... you might try e-mailing Seven Hills and telling them
of your experience with the voice mail. Maybe there's a problem with the
phone system they don't know about yet.

If you do e-mail them for assistance, use one of these two new addresses:

     shss@ix.netcom.com
     sales@sevenhills.com

You could also try faxing them your order. The fax number: 904-575-2015

Tell you the truth, I've gone to using snail mail for orders. I don't like
giving credit card numbers to voice mail any more than I do e-mail.

SSII: PRINTING IN PERFECT HARMONIE   Effective immediately, Harmonie has
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   become a Shareware Solutions II
product that can be purchased for $20; that price includes postage to
anywhere in the world.

At the moment, Shareware Solutions II will be selling Harmonie v2.11. That
includes the IW II drivers that had originally been part of Harmonie, but
that had then been sold as a separate product (Perfect Image).

<<<<<   I had a long talk the other day with Kevin Johnson (the owner of
"""""   Vitesse) about that very subject, and he tried to discourage me
from getting hopeful that 600 dpi would ever be possible on a IIGS. His
line of reasoning is that it would take more RAM than most of us have in
order for the IIGS to render a 600 dpi image in memory. He also added that
_if_ it were possible for Harmonie to support 600 dpi printing, it would
take forever and a day for the IIGS to render a page. Perhaps as long, he
quesstimated, as 20 minutes for each page.

And, that pretty much confirms what Bill Heineman told me.

On the other hand, Bill, Kevin and I all believe that 600 x 300 dpi
printing would be do-able. Whether it will be done is another story. I just
don't know at this point. But, I talked with Bill just yesterday about this
very subject, and suggested that we seriously discuss the possibilities
further at KansasFest.

So, at this point, I don't really want to get anyone's hopes up.

There's still a lot I have to learn about Harmonie. I thought I had the
most recent update installed on my system, but...

I just compared the modification dates of the Harmonie drivers I have
installed on my system to those found on the disk I just got from Vitesse,
and see that the one I use is 2 years older than the most current version.

So, I have a feeling that it is going to take me some time to "get up to
speed." Please be patient...

That said, I'm not all that concerned about not being able to personally
supply answers to DeskJet (and other Harmonie related) questions, as I'm
sure there are dozens and dozens of A2 regulars who've used Harmonie and
DeskJets who'd be happy to supply answers.

So, here's a question you've never heard a publisher of a software package
ask before...does anyone know the difference between the Harmonie LaserJet
IIp driver v2.01p and v2.11?

I just had an interesting talk with the BurgerMeister, and he told me some
things about Harmonie that I just didn't know; namely, all along, he's been
supplying Vitesse with Harmonie updates.

And, apparently, Vitesse has been updating Harmonie all along.

Among the things that Bill told me...

1) The problem with buffered parallel cards was fixed two years ago, so
Harmonie v2.11 should work with Grapplers and Parallel Pro cards that have
add-on buffer boards.

2) The 560c driver currently supports 600 x 300 dpi.

3) The StyleWriter driver works only with the StyleWriter I.

4) There used to be a problem getting full justification when using an
odd-sized (as opposed to an even sized) font, but that was fixed two years
ago.

Well, I'm off to install the Harmonie v2.11 LaserJet driver...

Sometimes when I insert the color cartridge it just won't work, other times

THE MAKINGS OF SSII   It's taken much much longer than any previous issue,
"""""""""""""""""""   but Shareware Solutions II, Volume 3, Issue 5 is
finally nearing completion and should start going out in the mail real soon
now.

When you get this next issue, I think you'll understand why it took so
long.

In my mind, this is the "Such A Deal" issue. There are more bargains
available to subscribers in this one issue than probably the last 3 or 4 or
5 issues combined. As pleased as I am to present all those great money
saving offers to the readers of SSII, setting up all those deals took
forever and a day.

In any case, it's a real relief for the end to finally be in sight. Just a

KansasFest 1997 is a go, but we need YOU too!  If you've ever wanted to be
able to say you were part of a KFest, this is the chance of a lifetime--who
knows what will happen in 1998?  Why take a chance on next year--be a part
of computing history now!

KFest '97 will be held on the campus of Avila College in Kansas City,
Missouri. It will take place from July 30 - August 3, 1997. The cost will
be only $375, which _includes_ use of a double room in the Avila College
dorms _and_ meals!  There are also a limited number of single rooms
available.  (If you wish to stay at one of the many hotels or motels near
the college then the cost is $300, but you would, of course, have to find
and pay for your own room and meals.)  The last date pre-registrations will
be accepted is July 20th.

Featured presenters this year include Joe Kohn, publisher of _Shareware
Solutions II_, the Apple II world's largest circulation newsletter; Max

_Shareware Solutions II_, as well as a showing of _Bernie ][ the Rescue_,
the Apple IIgs emulator for the PowerMacintosh.  The annual Apple II
writer's and publisher's forum will feature the editors of five Apple II
publications, our keynote speaker will be the webmeister of the hot new
Mother Of All Apple II Web Sites, David Kerwood, and this year's roastee
will be Richard Bennett, the world famous Australian programmer!

Check-in will be on Wedensday from 1-4 pm, and check-out from 11 am - 1 pm
on Sunday. Computer sessions will be conducted on Thursday and Friday.  A
vendor fair is scheduled for Saturday morning, with software and hardware
demos slated for Saturday afternoon.

Meals included in the registration price are Thursday breakfast through
Sunday breakfast, with the exception of Saturday dinner. All children under
18 years must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.

++ Please Note++ Dinner on Wednesday and Saturday are NOT included this
year. Attendees can dine on their own at one of the many fine restaurants
near the Avila campus, or join the Kfest '97 group for their annual treks
to KC Masterpiece and Jess & Jim's Steak House.

KFest this year is being sponsored by InTrec Software, Inc..

It's not an unpleasant kind of shock; more like a being caught completely

I just received a letter today from an old Apple II friend who owns an
Apple II software company. In his letter, he says that business has fallen
off in recent times, but since he still loves the Apple II and wants to
continue supporting current Apple II efforts, and at the same time wants to
"encourage the Apple II young developers," he has some plans cooked up that
will benefit the Apple II community, and Shareware Solutions II.

It looks like Shareware Solutions II will be making a slew of commercial
software products available through the newsletter. Included will be
programming utilities, an amazing teachers' gradebook program, and a
computer aided design program. And, source code for some of the software
will also be available.

I have absolutely no details at this time, except to predict that, at some
point in the near future, Shareware Solutions II subscribers are going to
be able to get some software that used to cost $100 or $200...for next to
nothing, through SSII. And, who knows, maybe we'll even throw in the
kitchen sink?

For some odd reason, I've been thinking about "support" lately. IMHO,
InTrec is THE company to duplicate as far as product support. What I've
also realized is that we receive excellent support from other sources and
don't often acknowledge that!

Ewen's support also qualifies as "excellent" as does Joe Kohn's (Shareware
Solutions II), Max Jones (Juiced.GS), Steve Cavanaugh (Apple Blossom and
Hyper Quarterly), Eric Shepherd (SheppyWare).

I've missed a few (sorry), but I'd appreciate it if you would take the time
to comment on those I've missed and let them know how much we appreciate
their outstanding support! I don't do it often enough so any help you can
offer would help lower my "guilt":)

     Before you delve wholeheartedly into this review, a necessary
disclaimer: I've done some work for Apple Blossom Publishing in the past,
and anticipate continuing to work for them in the future.  That said, I've
made every effort to keep this review as impartial as possible.

     In the glory days of the Apple II, when all of the wonders of the
Apple IIgs were fresh and new, Apple Computer, Inc. delivered an Apple IIgs
program that even they didn't think could be done: _HyperCard IIgs_, a
GS/OS version of the program that was revolutionizing the way people used
the Mac.  Shortly thereafter, Resource Central, the company behind the
legendary newsletter _A2 Central_ (aka _Open-Apple_) entrusted a vagabond
named, oddly enough, HangTime to produce a bimonthly disk publication
dedicated to _HyperCard IIgs_.  That publication was called _Script
Central_, and it showed the world  how a little scripting could push the
Apple IIgs to its limits.  Every two months, a new set of stacks would
arrive and welcome the user to another Bo (Monroe), Mo (Mohawk Man, aka Jay
Jennings), and Me (HangTime) production.

     Years passed, and Apple Computer, Inc. reclassified _HyperCard_ for
the Apple IIgs as system software, meaning it would be available almost
free from such places as Apple's own ftp sites and the Genie A2 libraries.
But time wasn't kind on all fronts--eventually Resource Central folded, and
took _Script Central_ along with it.  Undaunted, HangTime teamed up with
Joe Kohn of _Shareware Solutions II_ to keep back issues of _Script
Central_ available, and left the door open for possible new issues of the
HyperCard publication--unfortunately, for unknown reasons, these new issues
never materialized.

     Now, several years later, HangTime is back, this time with a new pair
of sidekicks in Gareth Jones of the _Apple B.C. News_ (a user group
newsletter) and Steve Cavanaugh, publisher of _The Apple Blossom_, with a
new, exciting Apple IIgs disk publication based on _HyperCard IIgs_ in the
tradition of _Script Central_: _Hyper Quarterly_.  The new, quarterly,
subscription-only publication made its debut in May 1997 with its first
two-disk issue.

     Brought to you by Apple Blossom Publishing, the premier issue features
_HyperCard_ stacks by our old friend HangTime (including a Star Trek-like
front end that lets you navigate a galaxy of stacks and declares the new
publication a "Steve, Gareth, and Me" production) and newer, less-known
(though not less gifted) scripters Jones, Cavanaugh, Josh Calvin, and Brian
Gillespie.

     Aside from several columns and tidbits of interest to _HyperCard IIgs_
fanatics, included in this first issue is a varied collection of stacks
that show you the many uses of _HyperCard_--from the practical (Good Eats,
a recipe stack with loads of great meals, and TZ Rolodex, a stack-based
version of its namesake) to the Geekish (A la Carte, a _HyperCard_
programming assistant), from the utilitarian (Quarknet, an off-line
processor for the Delphi online service for use with _Spectrum) to the
eccentric (TableMaker, a tool to assist with the creation of HTML
"tables")-- _Hyper Quarterly_ will make even the most jaded IIgs user
smile.

     _Hyper Quarterly_, like _HyperCard IIgs_ itself, is an attempt to
truly give you the power to be your best.  It strives to give you all of
the power and versatility of the Apple IIgs in a form that's easily learned
and used.  I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone with even a passing
interest in _HyperCard IIgs_.

               >>> THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST AT KANSASFEST <<<
               """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
        Copyright 1996, 1997 by Douglas Cuff.  All rights reserved.


     The Accidental Tourist travel guides were described by Anne Tyler in
her 1985 novel of the same name (later a movie starring William Hurt,
Kathleen Turner, and Geena Davis).  The Accidental Tourist guides were
designed for the business traveller whose reactions to travel were feelings
of anxiety and defenseless.  The guides were meant to soothe and comfort
the non-adventurous traveller.

     If you've never been to KansasFest before, you should find that this
guide will do the same for you.  If you're an old hand at KansasFest, this
guide will provide you with some helpful reminders.  (If you've read this
far with a growing sense of _deja vu_, that's because this article
originally appeared last year in GenieLamp A2 Vol. 5, Issue 52 [July 1996].
It's been updated for KansasFest 1997.)

     One word of warning:  If there's a conflict between the advice you
receive from the Accidental Tourist and the instructions you're given from
the information packet when you arrive at KansasFest--pay attention to the
official info packet.  These folks know the score.

     KansasFest began in 1989 as the A2-Central Developer Conference, and
didn't begin calling itself KansasFest until its third year, 1991.
KansasFest takes place in Kansas City, Missouri.  (Not Kansas City, Kansas.
The Kansas border is less than a mile away, if that comforts you any.)

     This will be the ninth annual KansasFest, and it's not just for
programmers and developers any more.  If you've never been to KansasFest
before, you don't know what you're missing!  It's a great chance to learn
about your Apple II, mingle with other users, and see what software other
people are working on.  This is the Apple II event of the year.  I can't
say exactly how many people will there, but a safe estimate is 60-100
attendees (counting those who stay off-campus).

     What campus?  KansasFest takes place entirely at Avila College, in the
southmost part of Kansas City.  Here's the address:

          Avila College
          11901 Wornall Road
          Kansas City, Missouri  64145  U.S.A.
          phone (816) 942-8400

     Avila College is small--approximately 1500 students--which means you
can walk anywhere on campus in five minutes.  Use of a car is therefore as
optional as it's ever going to get, assuming you fly to Kansas.  The one
time you are going to be hollering for a vehicle is when you try to get to
and from Kansas City International airport.  More on that shortly.

     This year, KansasFest is scheduled for July 31-August 3, but dorm
rooms are available for the nights of July 30-August 2.

          PM   Wed July 30    arrival
               Thu July 31    scheduled sessions
               Fri August 1   scheduled sessions
               Sat August 2   demos (morning); vendors' fair (afternoon)
          AM   Sun August 3   farewell

     Check-in time is 1-4 PM Wednesday.  Check-out time is 11 AM-1 AM
Sunday.

     How much the conference costs depends on when you pay for it and what
kind of accommodation you require.  You can save a few bucks if you're
willing to share a room--private rooms cost more.  (The prices went up by
$75 on May 21.)

          private room        $450
          shared room         $375
          conference only     $300

     Even if you can find a room in Kansas City for $18.75 a night ($37.50
a night private), staying on campus is still a better idea, since
after-hours activities are a big part of KansasFest.

     There have been some important changes in the meals this year.  To
begin with, free lunch at Avila's cafeteria used to be included for _all_
KFesters, even those not staying on campus.  This year, those not staying
on campus must provide their own lunches.  Fortunately, being banished from
the Avila cafeteria won't make anyone weep.

     Also, those staying on campus should note that no evening meal is
provided on Wednesday night nor on Saturday night.  The lack of a Wednesday
meal isn't significant--that's still before the kick-off, so to speak.  But
keep in mind that you're on your own your last night there.  (You can get a
breakfast on Sunday, though, if you're staying on campus.)

     You will be staying in either Carondelet or Ridgway dormitory, both of
which were built in 1963.  For those of you who have never experienced
residence life or have forgotten what it was like, expect spartan
surroundings.  Forget the idea of a private bathroom, but you'll be glad to
know that the rooms are air-conditioned.

     (You'll probably find yourself in Ridgway--that's where KansasFest
1996 made itself at home.  There and the Whitfield Conference Center.)


BEFORE YOU GO   As with any trip, you need to arrange for several things:
"""""""""""""
     o  conference attendance (fee $300/$375/$450);
     o  accommodation (included in package);
     o  meals (included in package);
     o  transport to/from conference.

     Those attending from outside the United States will also need:

     o  passport/visa;
     o  medical insurance;
     o  US currency/traveller's checks.

Conference Attendance   There are 80 spaces for on-campus attendees, and
'''''''''''''''''''''   the last day pre-registration is available is July
20.  Even if you register late, there may be room for off-campus conference
attendees, so you may be able to register at Avila on July 30/31.

     For fast information, E-mail cindyadams@delphi.com.

     If you'd like to register, write:

          Phoenix, AZ  85028-4423
          USA

     Please make checks payable to "InTrec Software".

     Credit card registration is also available.  Just call InTrec
Software, Inc. with your VISA, MasterCard, Discovery, or American Express
number at (602) 992-1345, Monday-Friday 8:00 AM-5:00 PM Mountain Standard
Time.  You can also fax your registration with credit card account number
and expiration date to (602) 992-0232 (also Monday-Friday; 8:00 AM-5:00 PM
Mountain Standard Time).  Or E-mail your credit card account number and
expiration date to proterm@intrec.com.

     In summary, to register by credit card:

          o  write to the address above (cheques also okay here);
          o  phone (602) 992-1345;
          o  fax (602) 992-0232; or
          o  e-mail proterm@intrec.com

     But remember, that's only when you know you want to register.  If you
have questions first, send e-mail to cindyadams@delphi.com.

Accommodation   If you're staying at Avila College campus, chances are good
'''''''''''''   that you're going to be sharing a room with one other
person.  Space is limited to 80 beds this year, so you're unlikely to end
up in a room by yourself unless you specifically request a private room
(which costs more).  The rooms are _not_ co-ed, but the dorms are.

     There aren't any hotels within walking distance of Avila College, so
plan on having transportation if you're staying off-campus.

     Here are some hotels said to be near Avila College.  Please be warned
that I haven't stayed at any of them, so I can't make recommendations.
Most have approximate room rates shown; some do not.  None of the room rate
quotations I found have changed since the 1996 edition of this guide.  In
three cases, I was not able to find updated figures--these are marked
*(1996 rate)*.  Since none of the other hotels have changed their rates in
the past year, you're fairly safe in assuming that these three haven't made
substantial changes either.

Meals   If you're staying on Avila campus, meals are included in the
'''''   package price.  If you aren't staying at Avila, you're completely
on your own.

     If you find the cafeteria food not to your liking--and many
don't--you'll be relieved to know that there's a supermarket about 25
minutes' walk away.  Here's how to get there:

     Start at Carondelet dorm.  Stand with your back to the dorm entrance,
so that you can see the Marian Center if you look left.  Turn right from
Carondelet and walk down to the parking lot.  Turn left and walk out of the
parking lot, down Sister Oliver Louise Drive.  This private road takes you
to 118th Street.  Turn left and walk on 118th until you reach Wornall Road.
Turn right on Wornall until you reach the intersection of Wornall and
Minor.  Turn right onto Minor Drive.

     Once on Minor, ten minutes' walk will bring you close to the end of
Minor, to the point where you can see a large parking lot.  Veer left and
you'll be at a small shopping mall that boasts a bank, a supermarket, and a
restaurant.  (Note:  This trip can be made a few minutes shorter, but these
directions are simpler, and can be easily adapted for use by motorists as
well as pedestrians.)

     If you're not staying on Avila campus, you're probably sufficiently
adventurous to know how to find decent food in a strange city.  Be aware
that small groups tend to sneak off-campus to a restaurant (often either KC
Masterpiece or Jess & Jim's) for at least one evening meal during the
conference.  Let them know you want to be part of the excursion!

Transportation 101/A--Getting to Kansas   Many of you intend to fly to
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   Kansas City.  The airport you
will be arriving at is Kansas City International (MCI).  The airport has
three arc-shaped terminals.  If you're meeting someone there, be sure that
everyone intends to go to the same terminal, or that everyone is catching
the (free) shuttle to the same car rental agency.

     You can pick up a city map at one of the airport magazine stands.  The
Gousha map has Avila College marked (grid location I-19).  If you don't
have a map, better pay close attention:

     If you drew a map of Kansas City on a 8x11 sheet of paper, the airport
would be in the upper left corner, to the northwest.  Avila College would
be near the bottom of the piece of paper, near the center.  Point taken?

     The distance between Avila College and the international airport is
not small.  It's perhaps 45 miles by the recommended route (below), so
allow an hour's travel time at a bare minimum.  What with collecting your
luggage and arranging/co-ordinating transport, it's probably safer to
assume it will take you two hours to get from the airport to Avila,
starting from the time the plane's landing gear touches the tarmac and
stopping when you sling your suitcase onto the dorm bed.

Transportation 101/B--Getting to Avila   Since the distance from the
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   airport to Avila College is 28
miles as the crow flies, and about 45 miles by car, you don't even want to
think about taking a taxi.  You'd pay $40 minimum, possibly as much as $60.
For a one-way trip.

     If you book ahead, you can get Quicksilver to take you to Avila
College at a more reasonable rate:

          $24 for 1 person
          $32 for 2 people
          $40 for 3 people
          $43 for 4 people
          $55 for 5 or 6 people

     You _must_ book Quicksilver in advance.  They need at least one day's
notice, so call them at 1-800-888-8294 or 816-262-0906.  IF YOU DON'T MAKE
A RESERVATION, THEY CAN'T TAKE YOU.

     If you don't want to rent a car, you could also take the Airport
Express van to the Overland Park Marriott hotel and take a cab from there.

     (Those of you renting cars at the airport:  we'll discuss the route
shortly, in the ARRIVAL section.)


PREPARING FOR THE TRIP   Get plenty of sleep before you go, because you're
""""""""""""""""""""""   not likely to get much sleep at KansasFest.
KansasFest days are 18 hours long, unless they're 20 or 24 hours long.
There's too much going on to waste time in sleep!

     On the same note, make sure you don't schedule anything important
(like operating heavy machinery) for the day after KansasFest--Monday,
August 4.  You'll have had so little sleep that you won't feel your best.

Packing--Computer Stuff   Lots of people brings computers.  If you're doing
'''''''''''''''''''''''   this, make a backup of your hard drive and leave
the backup at home.  If you won't feel safe unless you take a backup with
you, make two backups.

     If you're bringing a hard drive and you're travelling by plane, you
may want to consider packing the hard drive in your carry-on luggage.  That
way, you can extract the hard drive from the luggage before it gets X-rayed
(!).  Tell the attendant that what you are carrying in your hand is a hard
drive for a computer, and that it might be damaged by the X-ray machine.
Chances are they'll handle it differently.  If they tell you that no damage
could possibly be caused, don't believe them.  (You may have to obey them,
but don't believe them.)  Try insisting--politely!--on special handling
anyway.  Incidentally, X-rays are not good for diskettes either.

     Bring plenty of extension cords, power bars, and surge suppressors,
plus phone cord if you bring your modem.  Bring plenty of blank disks.
Bring anything you'd like to show off, either software or hardware.

Packing--Other Stuff   A word about clothing:  KansasFest is "dress
''''''''''''''''''''   casual", and Kansas City in July is hot and humid,
so light clothing would be a good idea.  If you're bringing anything that
you want to hang in the closet, bring your own hangers.

     You should pack a bathrobe or something you don't mind walking the
halls in when you rise in the morning.  The dorms will be housing both
sexes, and there are no private bathrooms.

     Towels are supplied, but you can pack an extra one if you feel so
inclined.  Be sure to bring all the usual toiletries:  soap, shampoo,
toothbrush, and all the etceteras.

     There are modular phone jacks in all the dorm rooms, but phones are
not provided, so pack a phone, if only for local calls (which are free).
If you know who your roommate is, you can assure her or him that you're
bringing the phone and save her or him the trouble.

     If you're serious about making the morning sessions, an alarm clock is
a good idea.  If you're _really_ serious about attending morning sessions,
ear plugs--for the night before--couldn't hurt either. <grin>

     Unless you're a private soul, some sort of sign for your door is a
good idea, so that people can find you.  Many people take the trouble to
make these before they leave.

     Don't forget your airline tickets and other travel documents, if any,
but don't pack them in your checked luggage.  Also don't forget a quarter
for a phone call.


ARRIVING
""""""""

Getting from the Airport to Avila   If you've arranged with Quicksilver to
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   pick you up at the airport, as you
leave the "gate", look for someone holding up a sign with your name on it.
(The sign will probably also have "Quicksilver" written on it.)

     Of course, Quicksilver have been known to get busy at KansasFest time.
If no one is there looking for you, start by looking for them.  The
Quicksilver people are usually easy to spot.  If there's no one from
Quicksilver in the terminal, don't panic.  Just call them at 262-0905.
This is a local call from the airport.  (You did remember a quarter for a
phone call, didn't you?)

     Remember that you _cannot_ ride with Quicksilver unless you have made
a reservation at least one day in advance.

Driving from the Airport to Avila   If you're renting a car, start looking
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   for the desk of the rental agency
you're dealing with.  (Remember that there are shuttle buses among the
three terminals, if necessary.)

     Once you've got your car, exit through the airport's main gate
(Cookingham Drive) onto Interstate 29 heading south.  At highway 152, exit
west.  Follow 152 west to I-435.  Take I-435 south and follow it around
until it reaches Wornall Road from the west.  Take the Wornall Road exit.
Then turn in at Avila College (which is a left turn off Wornall if you
approach it from I-435).  Check our handy Avila map below for where to
park.  The best place is probably the lot near the dormitories.

After Hours Arrival   It's Wednesday night, and it's dark already.
'''''''''''''''''''   Quicksilver has just dropped you off... or you've
just parked the rental car.  You're tired after the long drive from the
airport.  You've never been to Avila College before.  Now what do you do?

     Well, if you know beforehand that you're going to arrive after hours,
you should contact Cindy Adams so that she can let the Avila staff know
about late arrivals.  Suppose, however, that you've arrived late by
accident--your flights was delayed, or your car had a flat?  What do you do
now?

     It's easy.  The campus at Avila is small, and there are only three
building that KFesters need to explore:

     I.  Whitfield Conference Center:  This is where most of the actual
conference sessions take place.  It's sufficiently small that you'd have to
try really hard to get lost here.  If you walk the path to Whitfield from
one of the other buildings listed below, go down the stairs as soon as you
get inside the door.  If you enter Whitfield from the roadway, you're at
the main conference entrance, so don't worry.

     II.  Marian Center:  This is where the cafeteria is.  Unless you're
booked into a nearby hotel, this is where you come to eat.  This is also
where the celebrity roast is traditionally held.  Yes, you're allowed to
attend the roast even if you're staying at a hotel, and you get to eat
lunch here too.

     III.  either Ridgway or Carondelet dormitory:  This is where you
sleep, at least in theory.  Even hotel-dwellers need to know about the
dorms, since you'll spend a lot of your evenings hanging out here.  At past
KFests, both dorms have been used, but this year, only one of them is
available.  You'll find out which is the KFest dorm for 1997 when you
arrive.

     Look at the map of the campus below and get your bearings:

     The only real luxury that the rooms boast is air-conditioning.  No
private baths here, but you'll find bathrooms just down the corridor a
piece.  The one I frequented had one bathtub, two showers, three toilets,
four sinks (one with an attachment for washing hair), and assorted mirrors.
Every floor also seems to have a TV lounge and a small kitchen.

Business Hours Arrival   If you arrive at Avila between 9 AM and 5 PM
''''''''''''''''''''''   (preferably between 1 PM and 4 PM Wednesday!), you
can register for the conference and your room (if applicable) at the same
time.  Check your pre-conference packet for information on where to
register.  It will be somewhere in one of the four buildings mentioned
above, of course.

     One note of warning:  if you've been told to register somewhere--say,
the cafeteria at Marian center--and no one has shown up fifteen minutes
after the listed start time, then by all means check the dorms and
Whitfield center to see if registration has been moved there.  It's
unlikely you'll have to worry about something like this, but it doesn't
hurt to be prepared.


ONCE YOU'RE THERE
"""""""""""""""""

Curricular Ed floor" to most Europeans).  Similar deal for the second
and third floors.  If your room number doesn't begin with 4, 5, or 6, it
means you aren't staying at Ridgway.

     If wandering around the dorms doesn't produce any results, try Marian
Center.  If you still can't find anyone, wander down toward Whitfield.

     Arriving after hours means you get to check in to your room.  You
still must register for the conference in the morning.  We'll cover that in
the "Business Hours Arrival" section.  For now, what about your room?

Your Room   Rooms at the Avila College dorms each have two beds.  If your
'''''''''   roommate is there, smile and introduce yourself.  If your
roommate isn't there, don't be alarmed.  Your roommate may not have arrived
yet, in which case you get to grab the best bed.  (I'm joking.  Neither bed
will be any less loathsome than the other.)  Probably your roommate has
already arrived, grabbed the best bed, and is out visiting others.

     Near the beds is a long institutional-looking unit with two closets,
two sets of drawers, and assorted storage space.  The opposite side of this
unit is a desk long enough for two people to work at.  There's plenty of
room for two computers on this desk, but there's just one outlet per
computer.  If you don't have a power bar or a Kensington System Saver or an
AE Conserver, you're going to be limited to plugging in the computer and
the monitor--no hard drive, no modem, nothing else.  (Those of you with
internal hard drives can stop being smug right now.)

     Near the desk are two outlets that seem to be phone jacks.  They
_aren't_ phone jacks.  The phone jack is on the other side of the room, by
the beds.  If you didn't bring plenty of phone extension cord, you'll have
to set up your computer at the foot of your bed.  (Don't laugh.  It's
happened.)  Don't waste time looking for the phone; they aren't supplied,
which is why you had to bring one in your suitcase.  To find out the phone
number of your room (so that people can call you), ask one of the Avila
staff.  If you didn't bring a phone, you can still use one of the pay
phones in the hallways.

     When dialing out from your dorm room, either with a phone or a modem,
you'll need to prefix the number with a 9 to get an outside line.  If
you're using a modem, you may be able to use its "wait for dialtone"
feature before you dial the number.  So the proper sequence would be:

          ATDT9w4741778

     If your modem doesn't support "wait for dialtone", try using a few
commas (,) to create a pause:

          ATDT9,,4725178

     You may also need to set your software up so it waits about 45 seconds
for a connect instead of the standard 30 seconds, because it takes a bit
longer to get through to the number you're dialing.

     (There's information about dialing Genie later in this article.)

     The only real luxury that the rooms boast is air-conditioning.  No
private baths here, but you'll find bathrooms just down the corridor a
piece.  The one I frequented had one bathtub, two showers, three toilets,
four sinks (one with an attachment for washing hair), and assorted mirrors.

ONCE YOU'RE THERE
"""""""""""""""""

Curricular Events   Originally, KansasFest was a conference for Apple II
'''''''''''''''''   developers--people who wanted to create software and
hardware for others to use.  Nowadays it's for users, too.  Don't worry
that you don't belong there--you do and you're welcome, whether you've come
to party or come to learn.

     The sessions--no one dignifies them with the name "seminars"--are
mostly held at the Whitfield conference center.  The main conference room
is right inside the main doors (the doors closest to Wornall Road).  If you
don't know how to get to the session you want to attend, come here.  It
will either be in this room or someone in this room will know where the
right room is.

     There's a social aspect to this part of the occasion as well.  You'll
see plenty of schmoozing in Whitfield lobby, right outside the main
conference room.  Expect cameras, both still and video, and demented people
operating them.  Cameras are used to record the presentations, or people
meeting, or the general craziness that's going on!

     "Formal" sessions have been known to take place in the dorms as well.
_Informal_ sessions have definitely been known to take place in the dorms!

     On the last day of KansasFest, there's a demonstration of new and
upcoming software and a vendors' fair.  The demos are currently scheduled
for the morning and the fair for the afternoon, but that may change.  The
fair is a chance to pick up hardware and software at special KFest prices,
and to see and buy software never before released.

Semi-curricular Events   While not officially part of the proceedings, some
''''''''''''''''''''''   products _may_ be released at KansasFest.  (I
sometimes think Apple II programmers would never ever ship if it weren't
for KansasFest and Christmas.)  This year, there still haven't been any
announcements, so you'll have to attend to find out what's up-and-coming.

     Even if nothing gets released, you're practically guaranteed some
product previews.  Here are my wild guesses at what _might_ be shown this
year:

     o  Tony Diaz has threatened to have an LCD-based Apple IIGS working,
        "but not," he adds, "in the portable case that I attacked last
        summer.  I found a Dynamac and it fits much better in that case
        instead."
     o  Mike Westerfield has been working on a programming language for the
        Apple IIGS tentatively called GSoft BASIC.
     o  Mike Westerfield has also been working on a spelling-checker,
        though it's been a long time since anyone bugged him about it;
     o  Ewen Wannop is working on an offline message reader (one like
        CoPilot) called Crock O' Gold and is developing Spectrum XCMDs to
        make this
        task easier.  It's in release now, so ask around--someone has a
        copy of it.
     o  Burger Bill Heineman is going to be updating the Harmonie printer
        drivers for the more modern Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printers,
        according to Joe Kohn.
     o  Perhaps someone will have obtained permission from Derek Taubert to
        demonstrate his "in progress" web browser.
     o  SevenHills are continuing to work on an update to SuperConvert that
        supports JPEG graphics and many other new formats--perhaps there'll
        be a peek at what's done so far.

     Who knows what else?  _I_ sure don't!

Extra-curricular Events   It is perfectly possible to attend KansasFest,
'''''''''''''''''''''''   attend the sessions 9-5, and go back home.  But
why would you want to?

     One reason you might want to is that you're shy.  You're shy at any
gathering, but you can't imagine conversing with Richard Bennett, Joe Kohn,
Max Jones, Tony Diaz, Geoff Weiss, or Ryan Suenaga!  There's no reason to
be shy.  Do what Dean Esmay did at his first KansasFest:  walk around
introducing yourself.  To everyone.  You'll meet lots of people just as
awestruck as you are, and you can swap tips, stories, recommendations, and
lies.  Don't be intimidated by meeting well-known Apple II figures.  Heck,
we're all "just folks".

     Don't let yourself leave KansasFest without having mingled.  Wander
around the dorms.  If there's one person sitting at a computer, just say
"hi".  You're intelligent enough to know how to figure out if the person is
hard at work or at home to callers.  If there are a bunch of people--which
is far more likely, particularly during the evening--you might be shy about
joining the group.  Don't be.  Just announce your presence ("Hi, everybody!
Room for one more?").  You'll be surprised how welcome the group will make
you feel.  Whatever the group is doing, it's probably in "kibitz mode", so
join in!

     What will the group be doing?  Hard to say.  They might be:

     o  trying out software that hasn't been released yet;
     o  trying to get a piece of software to crash;
     o  trying to get it to stop crashing (i.e. debugging it);
     o  sending a group message to Genie;
     o  playing a game;
     o  fixing hardware;
     o  reminiscing about previous KansasFests; or
     o  telling stories about the heyday of the Apple II.

     There's a chance that the group will be "multi-tasking"--that is,
doing more than one of these things at the same time.

     There are other extra-curricular events that have almost become KFest
traditions:  the Roger Wagner tie report, Nerf(TM) warfare, and a game
called Bite the Bag, which involves a paper bag and a sense of balance.
But what about the "real" traditions?

Tradition I:  Celebrity Roast   If the term "celebrity roast" is new to
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   you, rest assured that it's not dangerous,
not even to the celebrity.  Open flame is not involved, except
metaphorically.  A roast is simply an event where members of a panel give
short speeches which "honor" the celebrity guest by dishing out
good-natured insults and back-handed compliments:  "A lot of people don't
know that Richard Bennett has a poor sense of direction.  Every time he
tries to come to KansasFest, he finds himself in England."  (Except that
most of the jokes will be funnier than that.)  Ideally, the person being
"roasted" is the keynote speaker from the previous KFest, but this isn't
always possible.  This year, the celebrity being roasted is indeed Richard
Bennett, the Australian programmer who recently updated Seven Hill's
GraphicWriter III and author of MiniTalk, the freeware Classic Desk
Accessory telecommunications program.

     This event is catered and held in the Avila cafeteria in the Marian
center.  It's open to all KansasFest attendees, not just those staying on
campus.

Tradition II:  Calling Genie   The link between KansasFest and Genie is too
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   complicated to go into here--suffice it to
say that people always manage to find time to post early reports on Genie.
I expect that this year, Delphi will also be a port of first call for many
attendees.  CompuServe and comp.sys.apple2 often get the news early, too.
But Genie is the service with the longest connection to KansasFest.

     Here are the Genie numbers local to Kansas City:

          Genie node      300/1200/2400   816-474-1778
          Genie node     9600             816-472-5178

     There are also SprintNet numbers, through which you can access both
Genie and Delphi:

            300/ 1200       816-221-9900
           2400             816-472-1430
           9600/14400       816-421-5783

     To sign on to Genie using SprintNet:

          1.  Dial the local SprintNet number.
          2.  Wait to be connected.
               o  If your modem is 300 baud, press H, then press Return 3
                  times.
               o  If your modem is 1200 baud, press H, then press Return 2
                  times.
               o  If your modem is 2400 baud or faster, type @H, then press
                  Return.
          3.  When TERMINAL= appears, press D, then press 1, then press
              RETURN.
          4.  Wait for @ to appear, then type C GENIE and press Return.

     To sign on to Delphi using SprintNet:

          1.  Dial the local SprintNet number.
          2.  Wait to be connected.
               o  If your modem is 300 or 1200 baud, press Return, then
                  press D, then Return again.
               o  If your modem is 2400 baud or faster, type @D, then press
                  Return.
          3.  When TERMINAL= appears, press Return.
          4.  Wait for @ to appear, then type C DELPHI and press Return.

     Don't worry about long-distance charges within the city.  The greater
metropolitan area of Kansas City is in two states with two area codes (816
for Missouri and 913 for Kansas).  However, nearly all calls within the
Kansas City metropolitan area are local.

     Remember that you need to prefix the number with a 9 (to get an
outside line) and either a "wait for dialtone" command (w) or "pause"
command (,) before you dial the number.

          ATDT9w472-5178 or ATDT9,,472-5178

Tradition III:  Dining Out   I confess I've never been part of this
''''''''''''''''''''''''''   tradition, but I hear that it's traditional to
take at least one meal at one of two restaurants (or both!)--KC Masterpiece
and Jess & Jim's.  The attraction is Kansas City steak, or so they tell me.

     If you hang out in the dorm rooms, you're bound to hear of groups
heading off to "dine posh".  Ask to be counted in... and tell me what
happens, all the gory details.  The thought of breaking bread with some of
these people intrigues me.


A TYPICAL DAY   A KansasFest day doesn't begin when you might it expect it
"""""""""""""   to.  It begins right after supper.  The pressing question
of something to eat over with, you take the aperitif of your choice--Jolt!
cola, Dr Pepper, or Mountain Dew--and wander around the dorms to see who's
doing what.  Some people will be staying up until _very_ late.  The reason
for this is that program bugs stay hidden until at least 2 AM, and the
really obscure ones wait until 5 AM.

     When morning comes, you may or may not have gotten any sleep.  If you
have, chances are that you didn't get much of it.  The cafeteria staff stop
serving breakfast at 8:30, but you may decide that sleep is more important
than food.  In fact, you may decide that sleep is more important than being
at the first session.  Or the first two sessions.  Or world peace.

     Eventually you get out of bed and dither over which of the
simultaneous sessions you want to attend.  You can bring paper or a
computer to take notes, if you wish--no one will laugh or point.  No one
will frown if you don't take notes, either.

     All sessions will run over their allotted time.  This is an immutable
rule.  The domino theory rapidly comes into play here, which wreaks merry
havoc with the schedule.

     After the morning sessions, there's an hour to get some lunch at the
cafeteria at Marian center.  (Lunch is available to all attendees, whether
staying on campus or not.)  No one takes attendance here, either.

     During lunch, the stragglers begin to arrive, and afternoon sessions
may be more generously attended and received, since pretty much everyone is
now awake and reasonably certain that life is worth living.  The afternoon
sessions will officially end at 5:00 or 5:30, but they may last a while
longer, since no one else is waiting to use the room.  It's possible to get
so involved in the final session for the day that you miss the evening meal
at the cafeteria.

     Or perhaps you've decided to give the cafeteria a miss.  Someone might
be headed to a restaurant for a meal--ask around.  After you've eaten,
well... the cycle begins all over.


LEAVING   Avila College hosts events other than KansasFest--in fact,
"""""""   Avila's summers are tightly booked.  In previous years, both
Ridgway and Carondelet dorms have been available to KFesters, but last year
(and this year?), the organizing committee could only get one.  That should
give you some idea of how hectic things are.

     Because Avila is playing host to others after KansasFest is over, be
sure to check out on time.  This year, you have the option of staying over
on Saturday night and checking out on Sunday, but don't push it.  Check-out
time is 11 AM-1 PM Sunday.  Avila wants you out of there by 1 PM on Sunday
at the _latest_!

     Incidentally, if you're travelling with Quicksilver, don't forget that
you must have booked your return trip to the airport at least 24 hours in
advance.  Since most people leave at much the same time, it may be possible
to cadge a lift to the airport if you've made friends with someone heading
that way.

     This is far from the end.  In fact, it's not even the beginning.  If
you've been reading this, it's undoubtedly to prepare for KansasFest, which
means it's all still to come!  So have a great time at KansasFest--and if
you spot the man who began it all, Tom Weishaar (a/k/a "Uncle DOS"), give
him my warmest regards.
