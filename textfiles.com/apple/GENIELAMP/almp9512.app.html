Notes From The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     Once again this year, my parents have taken pity on their destitute 
son and daughter-in-law and have given us a Christmas gift of a flight 
home.  And usually, by this time, I've ordered several Christmas gifts from 
catalogs and made other less material plans to help make the family 
Christmas bright.  Not this year.  Not yet.

     It's been a rough year... again.  Some are looking forward to the 
next year with trepidation because of the announcement that GEIS, the 
parent of GEnie, has hired a firm to find someone to buy GEnie.  I think 
it's worth quoting GEnie's acting president in full:

                                 [*][*][*]


            A LETTER FROM GENIE ACTING PRESIDENT, HORACE MARTIN

                                                     November 13, 1995

     Dear GEnie Subscriber,

          GE Information Services, the owner of GEnie Online 
     Services, announced yesterday that the company is working with 
     the investment firm of Allen & Company to identify potential 
     buyers for GEnie.

          The decision to seek a buyer for GEnie was a difficult one 
     for GE Information Services.  We feel tremendous loyalty to our 
     customers, and we considered very carefully the options available 
     to us.  Finally, our business decision was based on a desire to 
     focus on GE Information Services' main mission -- to provide 
     business productivity solutions to businesses around the world.  
     We lead this market, and we derive more than 95% of our revenues 
     from this market.  In 1995, GE Information Services has invested 
     in GEnie with a new graphical user interface, new multi-player 
     game offerings, faster access speeds, and simplified pricing.  We 
     believe that GEnie presents a good fit within a company whose 
     main focus is in the consumer market.

          GEnie subscribers are the best in the world, and we are 
     keeping you front and center as we seek a new owner for GEnie.  
     We assure you that you will receive top quality service and 
     support throughout this process.  We will make every effort to 
     make this transition transparent to you.  In the long run, we 
     hope that this transaction will make GEnie a better and even more 
     exciting service for you, our customer.

          Please check GEnie's logon announcements periodically.  
     Updates will be provided whenever new information can be 
     released.  (Type "GENIE" at any menu prompt and select Item #2 
     from the menu which is presented to access the announcements if 
     you're already online, or take a moment to review them each time 
     you logon.)

                                                 Sincerely,

                                                 Horace Martin
                                                 Acting President
                                                 GEnie Online Services

                                 [*][*][*]


     I think it's fair to say that all the people on GEnie are anxious, 
but particularly the Apple II community.  GEnie has become our de facto 
home.  On GEnie, we don't have to huddle in the "orphaned computers" 
RoundTable--heck, we have two RoundTables all to ourselves.  Those 
RoundTables take an archival approach to both its file library and its 
message base.  It looks for reasons to keep archival material in place, not 
ways to delete last year's hits to make room for this year's hits.

     GEnie is one commercial on-line service that still welcomes you if 
all you have is a text display.  It wants to help you point and click if 
that's what you like, but it doesn't turn away the user with lean, simple 
hardware.  We don't want GEnie to go away.

     Okay.  Fear is an understandable first reaction.  It's a mistake to 
stop at the first reaction, though.  I think Lloyd de Vries of the Stamps 
RoundTable put it best:  "'Acquisition' or 'sale' does not mean 'end.'"  
Lloyd points out that he works for CBS, who was recently acquired by 
Westinghouse.  "No one," says Lloyd, "seriously expects CBS to now go out 
of business."

     Ah... the voice of reason.  Exactly what I needed to make this season 
a joyous one.  Thank you, Lloyd.

     I would like to wish all of you--in the words of Commander Susan 
Ivanova--"Merry Christmas.  Or Happy Hannukah.  Whatever."

Letters To The Editor
"""""""""""""""""""""



TREASURE HUNT ERROR #1:  HTML EDITOR   In the last GEnieLamp A2, you made
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   a mistake in giving credit for HTML 
Editor.  You said it came from the Nova Scotia User Group.  Actually, I 
ported it from the Mac Hypercard stack of the same name.  I am not 
affiliated with the Nova Scotia Users group.

     Since HTML Editor is a port, no new features were added (i.e. 
WYSIWYG, verify for valid code, etc).  I am working on porting the latest 
Mac Hypercard version to HCGS (the only advantage is that it supports more 
HTML commands, such as forms).  It is taking a while since I have to write 
several XCMDs to make it functionally similar.  Hopefully, a GS web browser 
will soon be made so documents can then be viewed through IPC calls (if it 
will support them).

     Anyway, I was hoping the correction of where it came from could be 
corrected for the next issue of GEnieLamp A2.

Geoff Weiss

>>>>>   Our news service has been erratic as of late and I just received
"""""   and read the latest issue of the _A2 GEnieLamp_ [sic] (November, 
1995) and noticed an error in the Website area (Treasure Hunt).

     You list a program we feature in our public download archive as being 
"from the Nova Scotia Apple Users Group".  The program in question, 
HTMLEDIT was created by Geoff Weiss; we merely feature it in our archive as 
we do with many fine shareware and public domain programs.

     Could you please correct this oversight in your next issue as I would 
like to see Mr. Weiss receive the credit for his creation.

Thank you,

Tony Cianfaglione
President
Nova Scotia Apple Users Group
Chebucto Community Net

          My apologies to both Mr Weiss and the Nova Scotia Apple Users 
          Group.  In the Treasure Hunt column, I referred to the program 
          HTML Editor as "from The Nova Scotia Apple Users Group".  This is 
          because the person who uploaded it to GEnie obtained it from the 
          home page of NSAUG.  I was also determined to mention NSAUG, 
          since they were the closest Apple II user group to me when I 
          lived in Newfoundland, and I was once a long-distance member.

          My thanks to all those who brought this error to my attention, 
          the first of whom was the inestimable Joe Kohn.  No one who 
          corrected me--and there were quite a few--adopted an accusatory 
          or shaming tone.  (That is, no letters began "Dear jerk" :-)

          Read on, dear reader.  This was my month for errors.--Ed.


TREASURE HUNT ERROR #2:  rSOUNDER   I'd like to point out another error you
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   made in the GEnieLamp [A2] for Nov.

     You gave the wrong last name for the author of rSounder v3.0.  It 
should be "Benson".  I call this matter to your attention, not as a flame, 
but simply so that you may make the proper correction, when you have the 
opportunity!  I hope you won't be offended, when I mention that I called 
the error to the public attention, on our 1WSW Home Page update (11-4-95)  
in the politest of nature, I might add, simply because Paul Benson is a 
team member of our 1WSW group.

     Looking forward to your reply and with my best wishes I remain:

Charles T. "Dr. Tom" Turley
gbmaidsf@wco.com

          Absolutely--the author of rSounder was and is Paul Benson, not 
          Paul Creager.  My apologies to both gentlemen.

          Although it doesn't excuse it, I'll explain the substitution of 
          Mr Creager's name for Mr Benson's:  The "Shareware Spy" column in 
          the July/August 1995 _II Alive_ (which magazine I was editing at 
          the time) incorrectly lists Paul Creager as the author of 
          lf2crNDA.  (It was actually written by Jason Simmons.)  I had Mr 
          Creager on the brain, I guess.

          When contacted about the error, the programmer, Mr Benson 
          replied:  "Just as long as the checks are made out to me ;)."  
          Amusingly, Paul "Wily" Creager also had a comment about my 
          repeated attempts to credit him with programs he hadn't written:  
          "Gee, I better start coding!  :)"  Thanks for your continued good 
          humor!--Ed.


TREASURE HUNT ERROR #3:  GZIP2PKZIP   I found a minor omission in the
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   November GEnieLamp [A2] -- For 
GZ2PKZ.BXY, the description says that the program uses a command-line 
interface.  What is left out is that the archive contains a Finder Icon 
that allows you to simply double-click on a matching file to convert the 
.gz file to .zip format.

Don Zahniser
D.ZAHNISER

          Once again, I apologize.  As with the two cases above, it was my 
          own self personally who goofed.

          Thanks to all those to spotted my apology messages on 
          comp.sys.apple2 and wrote into say that they enjoy GEnieLamp A2 
          despite the occasional error:  DOTW (ongtatwe@iscs.nus.sg), 
          Mitchell Spector (spector@vax2.concordia.ca) and Larry W. Virden 
          (larry.virden@cas.org).--Ed.

     2'nd 256 bytes = Track 0, Sector 1

     etc..

     The common formats are:

     .DSK - As described above
     .DO - Same as .DSK. (Note that these two formats have the data in 
           "Dos 3.3 ascending logical sector order", data should be handled 
           as sectors, and not as ProDOS blocks)
     .PO - This is essentially the same as .DO, EXCEPT that it is in 
           "ProDOS ascending block order". That is, it was created by 
           reading a 16 sector disk with the ProDOS ReadBlock command, and 
           is ordered Block 0, Block 1, Block 2, etc.

     Conversion between .DO/.DSK and .PO formats is relativly trivial, 
once one understands the differences.

     Most files of this nature are stored as "Name.DSK.GZ" or 
"Name.DO.GZ", etc.  You need a utility capable of unGZipping these archives 
prior to trying to write them back to 5.25" media.  I have had =VERY=

THE VIRTUAL SERVICE BUREAU   If you have ever wanted to have some documents 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   laser printed, but lacked the money or 
inclination to purchase one for yourself and don't have access to a service 
bureau that understands Apple II programs and files, consider having me 
print your documents.  I have a large arsenal of Apple II software, 
including AppleWorks, AppleWorks GS, GraphicWriter III, PublishIt! 4, 
MultiScribe, as well as Macintosh programs that don't look down on their 
Apple II cousins.  I have been laying out newsletters and doing desktop 
publishing for more than 5 years (I began my desktop publishing career 
printing a newsletter for BirthRight in Vermont using PublishIt! 2) and am 
familiar with most issues surrounding Apple IIs and printing.

     There are three classes of work that I will be accepting:

     A) word processing/layout/printing
     B) layout/printing
     C) printing

     In practice that means something like the following:

     A) you send me a hand written newsletter or resume, etc., and I type 
        it, design and execute a layout, then print it;

     B) you give me files saved as a word processing or ASCII file, and I 
        simply pour that text into a page layout program, and print that;

     C) you send me a file that is already laid out in a program like 
        GraphicWriter III or AppleWorks GS, and I simply print that for 
        you.

     Just about any document will be accepted:  labels from a database 
file, newsletters, resumes, pamphlets, short books, invitations.

What You Need to Send Me   If you are asking me to do a complete job, then 
''''''''''''''''''''''''   all you need to send me is the manuscript.  If 
you want me to do the layout then you should send me a sketch or 
description of how you want the document laid out (if you have a 
preference), the word processing files, and a list of requests such as font 
(typeface, size, etc.), clip art, etc.  If you only want me to print your 
file, then you need to send me the page layout file and the needed fonts (I 
will need the fonts to be sure I have the same version and your layout is 
not disturbed.  (Fonts will be retained only long enough to print the 
document, and will not be kept afterward.  This is standard practice in 
publishing when files are sent to a service bureau, and is not an attempt 
to pirate.)  If you have graphics in the document, please send those as 
well, as I will try print them separately with SuperConvert which gives a 
better result.

How to Get the Document to Me   You can of course mail the document to me 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   (and will need to do so if you want me to 
type the doc :) via the postal service, but better yet, compress your file 
and email it to me.  This will be cheaper for you and faster as well.  If 
you have Internet access, you can also ftp files to me.  The URL for my ftp 
drop folder is <ftp://users.aol.com/stevec1021/incoming>.  If you do send 
the file via email or ftp, please compress it with ShrinkIt and upload it 
with Binary II or binscii the file to reduce chances of file corruption and 
down time.

What I Will Do With Your Files   If you have a particular program that you 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   want me to use to print your program, I 
will follow your instructions.  If not, I will use my best judgment.  I 
have over 500 fonts here, and should be able to meet any request of yours 
for a particular typeface or "look".  I also have several CDs of clip art 
(added together there is more than 147,000 images) so I should be able to 
meet your requests for clip art.

Schedule of Rates   When I mail your finished document back to you, I will 
'''''''''''''''''   send two copies (unless you have specifically requested 
more) just in case of accidents (*%#! I knew I should've moved that 
coffee!).  If you find any errors that I have made, I will of course, send 
you a corrected replacement copy free.

A) Word processing/layout/printing

     The fee for this service will be $2.00 per manuscript page for 
typing, $3.00 per page for layout, and $3.00 per page for printing 
(printing includes 2 copies per page).  This service includes one fax to 
you of the completed layout for your review/approval if you so desire.  So 
if you sent me a 10 page manuscript, the cost would be:

          word processing   10 pages x $2.00 = $20.00
          layout*            4 pages x $3.00 = $12.00
          printing           4 pages x $3.00 = $12.00
          TOTAL                                $44.00

B) Layout/printing

     This is of course much cheaper, as it is based on the number of final 
pages.  This service also includes one fax to you of the completed layout 
for your review/approval if you so desire.

          layout*            4 pages x $3.00 = $12.00
          printing           4 pages x $3.00 = $12.00
          TOTAL                                $24.00

C) Printing

          printing           4 pages x $3.00 = $12.00

Corrections   I will of course, not charge for any printer errors that I 
'''''''''''   should make, and will reprint your document if you discover 
any.  If the error is in your original word processor files, however, then 
it is not my error.  You are responsible for your own spell-checking.  Any 
corrections, deletions, or additions your request after the document has 
been finished will be charged to you at $1.00 per revision.

Shipping   Unless a customer requests a different method of shipping (for 
''''''''   example, overnight), printed documents that weigh 4 pounds or 
less will be mailed to whatever address the customer specifies by one of 
the following means, at the following rates.

     Destination | U.S.A. | Canada | Mexico | Other Countries|
     ____________|________|________|________|________________|
     Surface     |        | $ 5.00 | $ 6.00 |    $ 8.00      |
     ____________|________|________|________|________________|
     Air         | $ 3.00 | $ 6.50 | $10.00 | $10.00-$30.00* |
     ____________|________|________|________|________________|

*Latin America, Europe and Asia have different postal rates.  Inquire for 
specifics.  Prices based on publication 51 of the USPS, July 1995.

     For packages heavier than 4 pounds, special arrangements or prices 
will need to be negotiated.

Payment   Payment should be in U.S. funds made payable to "Stephen 
'''''''   Cavanaugh".  I will ship your work first, unless it is unusually 
large or expensive, and you can then send me the fee when you have approved 
the work (yes, I'm counting on your honesty).

     I know I've probably left some detail out that I need to cover.  If 
you have further questions, please email me.

ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION...   Well, I can say I've been on the internet, but 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   boy it sure is confusing.  I've figured out how 
to get to page 5000 and enter via Lynx.  Joe, I've made it to your home 
page.  I've Telnet(ed) to the UofM, but they wouldn't let me in without the 
password.  I wanted to go to comp.sys.apple... but I guess I have to wait 
until GEnie has Usenet capability.

     Boy, all I can say is a person has to want to get there REAL BAD!  It 
reminds me of how frustrated I was trying to use PRODOS after years of 
booting DOS3.3 and basic.  I just couldn't get the concepts straight.

     For any of you looking for a beginner's point of view, I would liken 
it to hearing of a wonderful swimming pool, where everyone is laughing and 
having a good time, and I can hear it, but I can't find it.

     "How do I get to the pool?" I ask...  And I get a discussion of the 
merits of the butterfly stroke vs the Australian Crawl.

     "But how do I _get_ to the pool?"  And someone cautions me 
(helpfully) to enter at the shallow end.

     "But how do I get to the _pool_?"  And someone points out the merits 
of one pool versus the other.

     "But _how_ do I get to the pool?"  And someone talks about the games 
played in one area vs another.

     Everyone is being helpful, but I am having to learn for myself 
EXACTLY which door to open, how to unlock it, which turns to make to get to 
the pool and where to enter.  All I want to do at first is dip my toe in... 
later I will make decisions on which pool games to play.

BOO!   I mentioned in another spot that I was building a Halloween robot.  
""""   Well, I did, and it worked great.

     The robot features a moveable jaw, LED eyes, and a speaker, all 
controlled from an Apple IIGS.  To put it mildly, it was a great hit on 
Halloween night!

     I'd like to find a venue for a magazine article, but all of the 
magazines I've worked with in the past that would take an Apple II article 
are either gone, or will be well before next October, when I expect the 
article would be run.

     Does anyone have a line on a magazine that might take an article 
about this robot as a general hardware/robotics article?  Or perhaps a 
magazine that covers all sorts of computers, and wouldn't mind that the 
robot is controlled by an Apple II?

     Unfortunately, the obvious solution won't work.  Making the robot 
work with a non-Apple II computer would be a nightmare--and very expensive, 
too!  Our favorite computer is an absolute natural for this kind of 
project. Seriously, you can buy a used Apple IIGS for less than it would 
cost for the hardware to connect this robot to a Mac!

     Any help would be greatly appreciated.

APPLEWORKS SAVES THE DAY--A TRUE STORY   "It started out as any other day 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   for IBM owners their DOS/WIN boxes 
were filled with virus, and then along comes a saviour with an Apple II and 
Appleworks on hand.  The cure was simple, always use an Apple II and 
Appleworks when working on important matters."

     I finally was able to hand in my group's assignment for our 
management class today.  It started out as a simple task, but as time went 
on it got worse.  The group that I worked with all had IBM computers, and 
one by one each computer caught a virus (in total 3, IBM computers became 
useless).  Then I came along with my trusty Apple IIgs and Appleworks 5.1, 
and in moments I retrieved the IBM disks, transferred all the information 
to the Apple IIgs.  I did this by saving the WordPerfect v6.0 for Dos file 
in Rich Text Format on the IBM Then loading the IBM disk into my floptical 
drive and used Egoed to open the Rich Text Format file, then resaved the 
file in Ascii format.

     I then loade the file Ascii file into AppleWorks v5.1, and long after 
that I reformated the whole text, and printed it out to my laster printer. 
The group was thankful, and couldn't believe the performance of Appleworks 
v5.1.  They kept saying, "How did you get rid of all those carriage returns 
like that in seconds?", and "Wow that was easy"...and of course I had this 
big grin on my face throughtout the whole crisis. :)

JEM SOFTWARE SHIPS DEJA ][   ARVADA, COLORADO, 1995 OCT 30 -- JEM Software 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   announced today that it began shipping version 
1.0 of Deja ][, a System 7 software package allowing users to run 
AppleWorks 5 in native mode on both 68k and PowerPC Macintoshes. AppleWorks 
has been the most popular integrated package for the Apple II for more than 
a decade, and is currently published by Scantron Quality Computers under 
license from Claris Corp.

     When asked if Deja ][ was similar to SuperWorks for MS-DOS, JEM 
Software owner Randy Brandt responded, "You're not running software similar 
to AppleWorks, you're actually running AppleWorks 5 on your Mac. We provide 
the 'Apple II emulation engine', but you'll still need AppleWorks 5 to use 
Deja ][. Of course, that also means your favorite macros and TimeOut 
applications will work on the Mac."

     While Deja ][ provides an "Apple II" environment for AppleWorks, it 
is also tightly integrated into the Macintosh environment, providing the 
ability to read and write files from a user's Macintosh hard drive as well 
as to copy and paste between the Macintosh clipboard and the AppleWorks 
Word Processor clipboard. Users of System 7.5 (or those with PC Exchange 
installed) will also be able to read and write directly from ProDOS 3.5" 
disks.

     Deja ][ includes more than two dozen UltraMacros dot commands which 
interact with the Macintosh environment. One such command allows AppleWorks 
to speak text with a macro, another will play Macintosh sounds, and others 
allow you to set background and text colors, the font size, the error beep, 
and more.

     Deja ][ was developed by Mark Munz and Randy Brandt. Mark Munz is 
renowned for writing "The UltraMacros Primer", programming TimeOut 
TextTools, and working for Beagle Bros, Inc. Randy Brandt was the lead 
designer and programmer for AppleWorks 4 and 5, and is also known for 
UltraMacros, Outliner, and many other AppleWorks add-ons over the past 
decade.

     Deja ][ lists for $128, but through November 1995 is available at an 
introductory price of $75 plus $3 shipping.

RESIGNATION OF II ALIVE MANAGING EDITOR   (7 November 1995)  Waterloo, 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Ontario--Doug Cuff wishes to 
announce his resignation as managing editor of _II Alive_.  He intends to 
remain editor of _GEnieLamp A2_ at least until he completes his third year 
in that post.

     Oh, to heck with the third-person voice.

     In fact, I resigned after my first issue (July/August), but agreed to 
stay on for a second issue when I found out that no one officially 
connected with Scantron Quality Computers (as it is now) had received the 
resignation!  Rather than inconvenience the publishers by making them 
search for an editor about two weeks before the August deadline for the 
September/October issue, I agreed to oversee my second issue, which I 
expressed to them on August 17.

     (In fact, the person who I was most anxious not to inconvenience was 
Carl Sperber, who handles design and layout of all SQC's print material.  
I've enjoyed working with Carl.)

     On a related note, Carl Sperber tells me that _II Alive_ Volume 3, 
Number 2 is "almost done".  Carl asked me for a few words of farewell to 
appear in this issue, which I E-mailed to him this morning.  I presume 
that's the last piece of copy needed to put the issue to bed.  With any 
luck, you should all see it soon.

     Until the new editor takes over, all mail sent to the II.ALIVE 
account will be forwarded to the QUALITY account.

APPLEWORKS FORUM CEASES PUBLICATION   Yep, it's true.  Here's the full text 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   of NAUG's announcement, snif...

                             The Time Has Come
                  by Warren Williams and Cathleen Merritt

     This is a difficult note for us to write, but after ten years of 
service to the AppleWorks community, NAUG will close its doors on December 
31, 1995.  It was a hard decision, but with declining memberships and 
rising costs, the writing is on the wall.

     Now that the decision is made, we are turning our efforts to making 
sure that NAUG goes out in style.  You trusted us with your ideas, with 
your writing, and with your money.  Our job is to make sure that we handle 
these responsibilities fairly and honestly.

     We will save our personal goodbyes for next month's AppleWorks Forum. 
But an announcement like this raises important questions.  Here are answers 
to some of those questions:

Question:  What will happen to the AppleWorks Forum?

Answer:  The December 1995 issue will be the last issue of the AppleWorks 
         Forum.  We want that issue to be spectacular, so we've asked 
         important contributors to the AppleWorks community to submit 
         articles, thoughts, and their heartfelt "goodbyes" for publication 
         in the Forum.

         The December issue will also include a timeline of memorable 
         AppleWorks events, and we need your help with that project.  
         Please send us any important dates you think we might miss...like 
         the date someone introduced your favorite AppleWorks add-on and 
         any other dates you think we should remember.

         Your December AppleWorks Forum will arrive in mid-December, about 
         two weeks later than usual.  That will give us the time we need to 
         prepare these late-arriving articles for the issue.

Question:  What will happen to the balance of the money you sent us?

Answer:  We will send the balance of your money back to you if you like.  
         However, we have five other options to offer you.  These include 
         full-year subscriptions to major magazines (values up to $39.95), 
         membership in the ClarisWorks Users Group, a complete set of back 
         issues of the AppleWorks Forum, and popular AppleWorks products at 
         unbelievably low prices.  The details of these offers appear on 
         pages 22 and 23 of this issue of the AppleWorks Forum.

Question:  What will you do with the money that is not reclaimed by 
           members?

Answer:  We will use any remaining funds to continue to operate our 
         electronic services (including NAUG's electronic bulletin board 
         service).  We will keep those services open until we run out of 
         money.

Question:  I just sent in my renewal payment. Will I have to request a 
           refund?

Answer:  We realized in early October that NAUG would have to close.  Once 
         we made that decision, we immediately changed some policies 
         regarding member renewals.  Members who paid by credit card or by 
         purchase order were only charged to extend their membership 
         through December.  Members who paid by check should fill out the 
         forms on pages 22 and 23 to exercise one of their refund options.

Question:  What will happen to the NAUG staff? Will anyone lose his or her 
           job when NAUG closes?

Answer:  At its peak, NAUG had 13 full-time and part-time staff members to 
         manage the membership list, fill your orders, copy disks, and 
         perform the other jobs necessary to maintain an organization with 
         more than 16,000 members.  But in recent years the staff spent 
         increasing amounts of time working with our sister organization, 
         the ClarisWorks Users Group (C-WUG).

         No jobs will be lost when NAUG closes.

Question:  Will I be able to get disks and templates from NAUG after 
           December 31?

Answer:  You will be able to download any files you want from NAUG's areas 
         on America Online, CompuServe, GEnie, and from the NAUG bulletin 
         board service.  But you will not be able to order disks from NAUG 
         after December 31.

         The special offer on page 23 lets you order public domain disks 
         for as little as $1 per disk, so now is the time to complete your 
         collection.  This month's issue of NAUG on Disk contains an 
         updated copy of NAUG's Public Domain Catalog that you can use to 
         choose the disks you order.  NAUG on Disk costs $10 postpaid 
         (international postage additional) and requires a 3.5-inch disk 
         drive.  If you do not have a 3.5-inch disk drive, the Public 
         Domain Update articles in each issue of the AppleWorks Forum 
         describe the different disks we added to our library.

         Our software licensing agreement with Apple Computer prohibits us 
         from distributing Apple's system software electronically.  If you 
         want those disks, please order them before our December 31 
         deadline.

Question:  What will happen to the disks in NAUG's Public Domain Library?

Answer:  We will archive and protect those disks in case they are of 
         historical interest to future generations.  We will also try to 
         identify a library or other institution that will care for the 
         disks and make them available to researchers and others with a 
         legitimate interest in their contents.

Question:  What will happen to 1040Works?

Answer:  Dan Verkade, the developer of 1040Works, is trying to decide if 
         the size of the Apple II market justifies updating 1040Works for 
         the 1995 tax year.  Mr. Verkade plans to make his decision by the 
         end of November and will notify previous 1040Works users by mail 
         in early December if he will update the package.  If you bought 
         last year's version of 1040Works, you will receive a letter if Mr. 
         Verkade decides to produce a 1995 version of the package.

         Mr. Verkade is anxious to hear your suggestions and comments, but 
         because of the anticipated volume of mail and messages, he will 
         not be able to respond to your contacts. Please direct your 
         encouraging comments to Mr. Verkade, not to NAUG. 

         [Dan Verkade, 51 Bowen Road, Perris, California 92571; (909) 
         943-5500; Internet: danbv@aol.com]

Question:  How can I contact NAUG after December 31?

Answer:  To save money (which will let us keep our electronic services 
         operating longer), we will disconnect NAUG's telephones on 
         December 31.  In an emergency, you can use the ClarisWorks User 
         Group's phone lines to contact NAUG.  The voice line is (313) 
         454-1969.  The fax number is (313) 454-1965.

II ALIVE TO PUBLISH QUARTERLY   I just talked with Quality about II Alive.  
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Here is the news:

     According to the operator who took my call, she never heard of the 
magazine.

     She transferred me to Michael, who said that there would be only five 
more issues, sent quarterly.  The next issue would be #14, the "Winter 
Issue," to be sent in December.

     I then talked with Carl in the advertising department.  He told me 
that the reason they were going to a quarterly issue was that there simply 
was not enough material coming in to fill a magazine.

     I asked if they had asked anyone for articles.  Carl said that they 
have few staff, and that they cannot devote much time to the magazine, 
because sales of Apple II stuff and interest in the magazine had declined 
so rapidly.

     I pointed out that it was Quality who had killed it, by not taking 
any renewals.  Carl said that they decided to not offer renewals because 
the renewals had dropped off so much from the 30,000 original subscribers.

     I pointed out that magazines such as Shareware Solutions II were 
growing.  Carl was glad to hear that, but said that the numbers for II 
Alive were just not enough.  That the five remaining issues would be their 
attempt to fulfill their obligations to subscribers.

     I asked about subscriptions that go past five more issues.  They have 
not decided what they will do, and will cross that bridge when they come to 
it, Carl said.

     I asked about what Doug had sent in.  Carl said that they were 
working on it right now, and that the December issue was definitely coming 
out in December.

     Carl and Michael were polite and listened to what I had to say.

     At the close of our conversation, Carl said, "It been fun while it 
lasted."

     What sort of content shall we send them, so that the magazine gets 
"fat?"

     I look forward to the next five issues with a lump in my throat.

SAN RAFAEL = CENTRAL-CENTRAL?   Well, well, well.  It looks like San 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Rafael, California is fast becoming the new 
home for ICON's former publications.  First, Shareware Solutions II started 
distributing Script-Central.  Then, Will Nelken announced that 
TimeOut-Central back issues will soon become available again from Marin 
MacroWorks.

     And, now....

     Studio City back issues will become available again from Shareware 
Solutions II.

FOUR PROJECTS AT SHAREWARE SOLUTIONS II   Hi all.  I just wanted to mention 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   a few new SSII developments....

     o  I had another talk last week with Warren Williams, and it now 
looks like NAUG _will_ supply Shareware Solutions II with a complete set of 
NAUG Library disks.

     o  It's going to be a while before Studio City actually becomes 
available.  The current copyright holder wants to supply me with a new set 
of master disks that contain current and up-to-date copyright info.  Since 
the copyright holder is a teacher, he plans to do that over his Christmas 
break.  So, look for the re-release of Studio City in early 1996.

     o  Despite my original intentions, Phase 2 of "The Computer That 
Could Have Changed The World Project" (the discovery phase) does not really 
lend itself to being videotaped.  After all, there would be very long gaps 
of silence in the tape, punctuated by an occasional "hmmmm" and "wow" and 
"what on earth is that?" type of statements and questions.  But rest 
assured, Phase 2 has begun.

     o  All that is holding back Convert 3200 from being released is one 
more stab on my part at translating the documentation into understandable 
English <grin>. That should be completed soon...possibly later on this 
week.

CONVERT 3200 UNOFFICIALLY AVAILABLE   I still have one major unanswered 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   question regarding Convert 3200.  
That question is whether Brutal Deluxe still plans to distribute the 
program in Europe.

     Once I have that answer, I will post an official press release 
announcing the availablility of Convert 3200.

     That said...unofficially, Convert 3200 is now completed and shipping.

a 100mhz PowerMac 7500 and a IIgs with a 10mhz Zip when the screen display 
was off (4.1 seconds).

     Here are a few models and average times with the display active:

       4.4  IIgs 10mhz Zip
       5.0  PowerMac 7500 (100 mhz)
       6.5  IIgs 7mhz Zip (mine)
       7.3  PowerMac 7100
      13.4  IIgs 3mhz (mine)
      15.8  Performa 5200
      21.3  Quadra 605
      23.6  Centris 610 (my 25 mhz 040)
      30.9  IIgs 1mhz (mine)
     161.5  IIsi (20mhz 030)

     That shows why we recommend 040's or PowerMacs, or fast 030's.  The 
drop-off to a slow 030 like Terrell Smith's IIsi is amazing.  Keep in mind 
that the test areas can vary a lot.  For example, my Centris scored roughly 
midway between my IIgs at 3 and 1 mhz, but it loads files much faster than 
my 7mhz IIgs, even without the snapshot option.

     Eventually, we expect to have a faster Deja ][, especially on PPC 
machines.  Mark has to learn more about optimizing for them first, but 
speed gains are definitely possible.  When that happens, a 100mhz PPC 
should easily top a 10mhz IIgs, so you can imagine how a 150mhz PPC will 
perform!

TOUCHTWO MACROS FOR APPLEWORKS   UPDATE on progress of TouchTwo for 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   AppleWorks 4 and 5.

     TouchTwo (formerly called HotKeys I) is very nearly at the point of 
distribution.  We were all but ready to ship on November 18th, as 
predicted, but on that very day we discovered a single bug in one of the 
programs.  It's rather obscure, but the crash it occasions is rather 
fantastic. :)  We have located the problem and it has to do with one 
segment of AppleWorks code (not our program).  We are working with Randy 
Brandt to figure out how to resolve it right now.

     I will keep you posted here.

     BTW, our next release, UltraMax, is also nearing completion.  We're 
aiming for a December 16th shipping date.  It's gonna be a great Christmas 
for AppleWorks fans!

     It started out as an impossible mission and soon turned into a 
maniacal mission.  For 3 weeks, I have had one thing, and one thing only, 
on my mind.

     Phase 1 is now complete.

     The details and technical specifications of the Apple IIGS ROM4 
computer...the machine that could have changed the world...the fabled 
GS+....the Macintosh killer...will no longer have to be the subject of 
rumors and speculation.

     The Apple II world has waited patiently for more than 4 years to 
learn what could have been.

     That long wait will soon be over.

[EDITOR'S NOTE:  Joe Kohn has promised to "blow the lid off" the ROM 4 in a 
                 coming issue of _Shareware Solutions II_, probably Volume

Christmas Cheer

                      >>> A VISIT FROM SAINT WOZ <<<
                      """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     'Twas the night before Christmas, no sound in the house.
     My GS is dusty and so is my mouse.
     My dealer's gone Mac; he's too brainwashed to care.
     Apple marketing smells like that old dairy-air.

     My children are nestled, all snug in their beds,
     While visions of Mac LCs (ugh) dance in their heads.
     The GS is dead, I've heard them all say.
     They might just be right; things look pretty gray.

     When all of a sudden a great noise I did hear.
     I woke with a start and fell flat on my rear.
     Awakened from slumber I jumped up to see,
     Tripped over the cat and twisted my knee.

     The moon brightly shone on the new fallen snow.
     I looked but saw nothing, then turning to go,
     Stopped short...  What's that?...  Is that synthLAB I hear?
     Why yes!  Yes it is!  That's good reason to cheer!

     I jumped and I shouted and I danced then because
     I knew right away that it must be Saint Woz.
     More rapid than Zip Chip, old Wozniak came.
     He whistled and shouted and called out by name:

     "Now Quickie!  Now Allison!  Now AppleWorks GS!
     Go Claris!  On SuperConvert!  I love you Vitesse!
     Platinum Paint is so cool!  Twilight Screen blanker rules!
     Who needs those old Macs when you've got Apple IIs?

     "If you have been true I've got presents to dole,
     But if you're like inCider you'll get lumps of coal."
     So up to the housetop with the Green Team he flew;
     Jim Merritt, Andy Nicholas, and Saint Wozniak, too.

     I kept very quiet so that I might hear
     SoundSmith tunes softly playing, spreading Apple II cheer.
     Then I heard a slight scrape and as I turned 'round,
     Down the chimney Saint Wozniak came with a bound.

     He wore blue jeans and sneakers and a T-shirt that said
     II-Infinitum ... II-Forever...  I had nothing to dread!
     A sack of great software he had slung on his back
     And he looked like a hacker there searching his pack.

     His eyes twinkled brightly, his dimples so merry,
     his cheeks red as apples, his nose like a cherry.
     His droll little mouth smiled a smile oh so grand.
     And a full bearded chin, GDL labels in hand.

     A thick slice of pizza he held tight in his teeth
     And the steam from it circled his head like a wreath.
     A plump little face and a round little belly.
     He laughed and it shook like a bowl of grape jelly.

     He was chubby and plump; a right jolly old elf.
     I laughed when I saw him, for he looked like myself.
     He winked right at me then he twisted his head,
     So I knew deep inside I had nothing to dread.

     He said not a word.  He went straight to work,
     Programming in ORCA, then he turned with a jerk.
     Then placing his finger on top of that mess,
     And giving a nod... _games_ for the GS!

     He jumped to his sleigh and it rose from the ground.
     But before it took off I saw him turn 'round,
     And I heard him exclaim, ere he flew out of sight,
     "Apple II Forever, and to all a good night!"

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

   [pshapiro@aol.com]



              >>> MAKING IT EASIER FOR OTHERS TO HELP YOU <<<
              """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     A friend of mine is the director of a women's shelter here in 
Washington DC.  Two months ago my friend asked me if I could help her find 
some computers she could set up for the women at the shelter.

     My first suggestion to her was that she should get herself online.  
By getting online she could make it far easier for others to help her.

     As it happens, my friend already owned a laptop computer.  Within a 
week I received a friendly "hi there" E-mail message from her.  Last week 
she sent me a message saying she took delivery of several donated computers 
for the shelter.

     How is it that being online makes it easier for others to help you?  
People who help charities and nonprofit organizations often have quite busy 
lives themselves.  Help-givers really appreciate being able to communicate 
online with others because E-mail communication allows them to offer more 
assistance to more people each day.

     Imagine this scenario:  Someone in your community is known to be 
willing to offer computer help to charities and nonprofit organizations.  
He or she takes an interest in getting technology into the hands of people 
who otherwise could not afford it.

     Would it be a productive use of that person's time to be playing 
phone tag with all the different people he or she is trying to help?  Just 
keeping track of who needs what kind of help could strain the patience of 
even the most reasonable person.

     Here is where the magic of E-mail kicks in.  Your request for 
assistance can pop up as an E-mail message on the screen of a help-giver.  
If you include your name, phone number, organizational affiliation, and 
address in your first message, that information can be quickly saved to the 
help-giver's hard drive.

     Once information is in electronic form (i.e. sent within an E-mail 
message), it can easily be referred to.  It can forwarded to someone else.  
It can be reposted as a public message on an electronic bulletin board 
system (BBS).  It could even be forwarded to sympathetic journalists in the 
press.

     Help-givers are always thankful when people needing assistance reach 
them via E-mail.  By getting online, people looking for assistance are 
helping themselves as well as helping their neighbors.  The streamlining of 
communication that takes place via E-mail can free the help-giver to give 
extra assistance to others.

     Here is another example.  Last month I helped the director of a 
nonprofit adult literacy organization get online.  It turns out this person 
already had a computer with a modem on his desk.  All that was needed was 
an hour's worth of time to help him get set up online.

     Three days later the person had already dashed off a dozen E-mail 
messages and had a long list of questions about the online world to ask me.  
Within the span of a week this person was transformed from being a person 
who had never used E-mail to being an active, enthusiastic online user.

     How will online communications help this literacy organization?  It 
will help in countless ways.  It will allow easy back-and-forth 
communication with foundations and other grant givers.  It will allow the 
director to engage in quantities of communication without the constant 
interruption of phone calls.  Every phone call that is averted by using 
E-mail is one less interruption in his day.  And one less interruption is 
one more opportunity for him to attend to other important work.

     It would be no exaggeration to say that online communication is one 
of the best ways of making the gears of society turn smoothly.  The 
telephone, on the other hand, is a communication device that makes the 
gears of society sputter along in fits and starts.

     This is not to say that there is no place for telephone communication 
between people needing assistance and help-givers.  It is just that 
benefits are often maximized when phone communication is kept to a minimum.

     If you take an interest in helping broaden access to technology, one 
of the most effective thing you can do is to help the leaders of community 
organizations get online.  By helping to empower them with an e-mail 
address, you can give them the gift of being connected. 

     Being connected online puts nonprofit agencies and charities in a 
much better position to raise their arms upward for assistance.  Online 
communication narrows the distance between the help-giver's arm and the 
help-requester's arm.  Increasing the chance of these two arms grasping 
each other firmly is what all of us hope for, isn't it?

                      >>> THE VERY BEST UTILITIES <<<
                      """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Welcome back to the Treasure Hunt.  This month, we're going to look 
at another in the series of the "Very Best of A2" archives that were 
created back in 1991 and 1992.  These files were designed to fit on a 
single 800K 3.5" disk.  Since the short descriptions only present an 
overview of these archives, I thought GEnieLamp A2 should provide detailed 
guides.

     Here are the 9 "Very Best of A2" archives:

     17180  BEST.A2.ART.BXY    2 Dec 1991  double hi-res pictures
     18761  BEST.OF.SHR.BXY    2 Jun 1992  super hi-res pictures
     17586  BEST.3200.BXY      1 Feb 1992  3200-color pictures
     18976  BEST.OF.MS.BXY    31 Jun 1992  Music Studio songs
     17897  BEST.UTILS.BXY     1 Mar 1992  8-bit utilities
     17356  BEST.GAMES.BXY     1 Jan 1992  8-bit games
     16957  BEST.ICONS1.BXY    2 Nov 1991  icons
     19399  BEST.FONTS.BXY    13 Sep 1992  fonts
     16728  BEST.EAMONS.BXY   29 Sep 1991  Eamon adventure games

     We've already examined the three picture collections--double hi-res, 
super hi-res and 3200-color--in Vol.4, Issue 39 (June 1995).  We also 
looked at the Music Studio songs in Vol.4, Issue 40 (July 1995).

     This month, we'll look at BEST.UTILS.BXY, a collection of the best 
8-bit utilities... programs that will run on an Apple IIe, Apple IIc, and 
often on an Apple II Plus.  (Which is not to say that they won't work on a 
IIgs, just that you don't need a IIgs to run them.)  A few of these 
utilities don't work well with the most recent version of ProDOS, but don't 
worry, we'll be sure to point them out as we go.  By the same token, the 
passage of time means that there are good utilities in the A2 library 
uploaded since 1991 and 1992, so keep in mind that this list is no-longer 
all-inclusive.

                                 [*][*][*]


LCASE.KILLER   (Lower Case Killer) is a simple but invaluable tool for
""""""""""""   older Apple IIs that can't display lower case.  This utility 
will let you run Applesoft BASIC programs that use lower case.  Just load 
your program and BRUN LCASE.KILLER.  All the lower case--in PRINT 
statements, REM statements and DATA statements--will quickly be converted 
to upper case.  You can then SAVE your modified BASIC program if you want 
to.  It appears first in the list because you might need to use it to run 
some of the other programs.  Public domain.


CAT.ALL.OG   by Jon C. Thomason creates print-outs or text files of a disk
""""""""""   or prefix.  The text files it creates are done by "printing to 
disk", as ProSel's "Info Desk" program does:

/sample.disk

FILENAME                     TYPE  BLK       MODIFIED         CREATED        
  
 TREASURE.HUNT................DIR    1   28-NOV-95 21:07  26-NOV-95 15:51
   FILE.LIBRARY...............ADB   22   28-NOV-95 21:07  28-NOV-95 21:07

This handy little program comes with a documentation file, and is freeware.


CKDISK   is a directory containing two separate programs:
""""""
Status.Checker   by Tom Vier is a simple program that checks a ProDOS disk
''''''''''''''   or volume to see if can correctly detect when the disk is 
write protected.  Freeware.

Smart.Test   by Tom Weishaar and/or Dennis Doms (I think) detects what
''''''''''   kinds of disk devices you have in your various slots.  It's 
based on a simpler program that appeared in the January 1987 issue of 
_Open-Apple_.  Freeware.


CYBERFIND.1.1   by Eric Mueller searches for the two most common ProDOS
"""""""""""""   viruses, Festering Hate and CyberAIDS.  It does not 
disinfect contaminated files, but it will give you the option to delete 
them.  NOTE:  Viruses have never been very common in the Apple II 
community.  Don't panic, okay?  Freeware.


DBLRES.IIPLUS   by Richard Napoli converts double hi-res graphics into two
"""""""""""""   single hi-res files.  This is handy for Apple II Plus and 
those who got extremely early Apple IIes that cannot handle double hi-res.  
This utility will handle double hi-res graphics in either Dazzle Draw or 
Beagle Graphics format.  It will take the original graphic and save it in 
two halves... the two file names will be the same, except one will end in 
.R (the right half of the picture) and the other in .L (the left half of 
the picture).  WARNING:  The program may hang after finishing the 
conversion with the most recent version of ProDOS.  Don't worry, your 
original and converted files are still intact.  Freeware.


DEARC2E   was brought to all Apple IIs by David R. Larsen and Michael
"""""""   Crane.  (There was an earlier IIgs version by Tim Swihart.)  This 
program will unpack files with the .ARC extension, an older but once quite 
popular archive format devised by System Enhancement Associates.  In the 
telecommunications game, it's important to have as many file unpackers as 
possible.


DISK.TEST   by Craig Peterson performs three basic speed tests:  it reads
"""""""""   block 0 repeatedly 1024 times; it does a sequential read block 
0-1023 (or to the maximum block number); and it does a seek test across 
one-third of the drive.  You can print out the results and do comparisons 
of various disks, disk drives, and other devices.  Freeware.


FREEPRINTER   by Elliot Lifson allows you to send text files to your
"""""""""""   printer.  It correctly interprets many Apple Writer dot 
commands (.LM for left margin and so on).  Now that Apple Writer v2.1 is 
freely available (file #20706 in the A2 libraries), you might want to 
consider downloading it instead of using the comparatively limited 
FreeWriter and FreePrinter programs.  WARNING:  This program hangs under 
the most recent version of ProDOS.  (This makes downloading Apple Writer 
v2.1 an even better idea!)  Freeware.


FREEWRITER   by Paul Lutus is a free but stripped-down version of his
""""""""""   classic program Apple Writer.  FreeWriter is not as powerful, 
it loads just 30K of text, and it has no means of printing the text (which 
is why FreePrinter was developed).  FreeWriter still works well, but with 
Apple Writer v2.1 now freely available (file #20706 in the A2 libraries), 
you won't need FreeWriter much any more.  Freeware.


FAZ.II   (File Attribute Zapper II) by Bruce A. Mah allows you to change
""""""   the primary type and the auxiliary type of files.  It provides a 
comprehensive list of available types so that you don't have to type number 
or have a book of file types in your lap as you work.  FAZ II also lets you 
type in the numbers of filetypes it doesn't know.  As a bonus, FAZ II lets 
you change the access bits--delete, rename, backup, invisible, read, and 
write--for a file.  Public domain.


FILE.CHOPPER   by Tom Hoover lets you chop text files into smaller, more
""""""""""""   manageable segments.  You can chose from 9 smaller sizes, 
from 25K to 225K (rising in 25K increments).  Freeware.


FILE.COMPARE   by Karl Bunker compares files so that you see exactly where
""""""""""""   the differences in two similar files are.  In the 
documentation, Mr Bunker has some amusingly caustic remarks about the user 
interface of the three file compare utilities that existed when he wrote 
this one.  These remarks have a kernel of truth, but unfortunately they 
don't address the major flaw in this program:  it's too slow.  Still, it's 
free, it does work well--and it is written in BASIC, after all.  Requires 
an enhanced Apple IIe, or any IIc or IIgs.  Freeware.


FILE.DIR   (presumably written by G.BUNEVITCH1) is another program that
""""""""   turns your CATALOG listings into text files.  Unlike CAT.ALL.OG, 
though, this program creates _delimited_ text files, which can be read into 
the AppleWorks data base.  The author has given his MD-BASIC source code, 
which will be of interest to fellow MD-BASIC fans.  Freeware (I think).


FLIST   is an uncredited utility that's really meant for programmers, not
"""""   users.  It produces a nicely formatted listing of BASIC programs, 
with each statement on a separate line.  It assumes that you have a 
printer, and that the printer is in slot 1.  Either freeware or public 
domain.


GECONV3   by Robert E. Phillips is powerful utility that converts GEnie
"""""""   file library listings into AppleWorks data base files.  This is 
incredibly handy.  There are no intermediate steps!  You don't have to load 
the text file into AppleWorks and convert it; the file that GECONV creates 
can be loaded right to the desktop.  This program is very 
situation-specific, but it does a great job.  Public domain.


HEXDEC   is a directory contain two cleverly simple conversion utilities
""""""   that both operate on the same principle.  Author Peter J. Paul 
(presumably!) has taken a single line of BASIC and stuffed in a text file 
so that you can EXEC that file to convert from hexadecimal (base 16) to 
decimal (base 10), and vice versa.  It's almost as easy as using a desk 
accessory on the IIgs.  Freeware.


IIGIF   by Jason Harper allows viewing of GIF files on any Apple II with
"""""   double hi-res capability.  Some Apple IIc users will need to patch 
this program; download either IIGIF.PATCH.BXY (#17447) or PATCH.IIGIF.BXY 
(#22983).  This program also loads RLE files.  Freeware.


INFO   by Clark Stiles is yet another utility for viewing and changing file
""""   types.  This utility uses a command style interface (you can type 
"INFO" and the correct parameters from the BASIC command line) and requires 
that you know the correct number for the filetype.  Freeware.


KOCO.LAUNCHER   by Douglas Konitzer is a simple program launcher--just 18
"""""""""""""   ProDOS blocks!--that lets you launch SYS files as well as 
BAS programs, plus view or print text files.  It also lets you load, lock, 
and delete files, and has the capacity to move up a directory... a nifty 
feature.  This program uses MouseText in its display.  If you use a hard 
drive, you might want to consider another launcher, since Koco Launcher has 
a maximum of 36 valid files on a screen.  (It filters out file types it 
doesn't know about... including AppleWorks word processing files.)  If you 
have more than that, the display will be messed up, and the program may 
even crash.  The "change drive" interface is also not geared to hard drive 
users.  Freeware.


LINEFEED.IR   (Linefeed Inserter/Remover) by Karl Bunker does just what
"""""""""""   you think!  It strips or adds linefeed characters to a text 
file.  (MS-DOS requires a carriage return and a linefeed at the end of a 
line or paragraph, but the Apple II requires only a carriage return.  
_That's_ why you'd want to perform either operation.)  Freeware.


PRODIR   by Lane Roath is another program launcher that shows you 26 files
""""""   at a time, and uses the space bar to move through the groups of 
26.  You can also lock, delete, and rename files, and the left-arrow key 
brings you up a directory.  Freeware.


QUIT.CMD7A   by David D. Ely patches the BASIC quit command "BYE" so that
""""""""""   it looks for BASIC.SYSTEM on the highest active volume (that 
is, devices in slot 7 are checked first, then those in slot 6....).  Of 
course, when BASIC.SYSTEM is launched, it looks for a file named STARTUP.  
This program was more useful when the BYE command was more primitive, as it 
was in earlier versions of ProDOS, but you may still find it handy.  
Freeware.


SF.GET   by Karl Bunker is a programmer's ampersand utility for that allows
""""""   Applesoft BASIC to have a rough equivalent of the IIgs SFGetFile 
toolbox call.  Users won't have to remember and type a filename or 
pathname--this program allows users to point-and-click the file from an 
on-screen list.  Optionally, SF.Get will let you restrict the list of files 
to a certain file type (TXT, AWP, etc.).  Freeware.


SHLPD.SYSTEM   (Super Hires Loader) by Thomas Dorris, lets Apple IIe and
""""""""""""   IIc users view IIgs graphics.  You must have double hi-res 
capability--and you should have MouseText--to run this valuable utility.  
Once you load a IIgs graphic, you can view it through a scrolling window... 
and the double hi-res color approximations are pretty faithful.  If you 
want to substitute one color for another, the adjust palette option lets 
you do that.  You can get a thumbnail sketch or overview of the picture, 
and when viewing through the scrolling window, you can toggle whether the 
pixel width is doubled or not.  The function to save the converted file has 
been disabled.  The program claims to be crippled public domain software, 
but in fact, the author retains his copyright, so it's really crippled 
freeware.

|                                                                         |
|   Back in 1991, the concepts of public domain, freeware, and            |
|   shareware were less clearly defined.  It's not surprising that        |
|   programmers occasionally slipped up and called their programs         |
|   "public domain" when they meant "freeware".                           |
|                                                                         |
|   What exactly is the difference?  If you allow something you've        |
|   created--a program, an article, a song, a poem--to be ceded to the    |
|   public domain, then you've lost all rights to it.  The public owns    |
|   it.  Any member of the public can do whatever he or she wants to      |
|   with it, without charge.  In that sense, the work is free.  (Though   |
|   any member of the public can sell a copy of your work for $50 a       |
|   copy if enough suckers can be found.  No, you can't stop them, even   |
|   though you meant the work to be free.  You gave up all your rights    |
|   when you ceded the work to the public domain, remember?)              |
|                                                                         |
|   If you want to retain your copyright but still allow everyone to      |
|   enjoy your work without charge, that's called freeware.  If you       |
|   want your work to be distributed without charge, but want users to    |
|   pay voluntarily if they keep a copy of it, that's called shareware.   |
|   (It's also called boundless optimism, apparently.)                    |
|                                                                         |
|   Somewhere between freeware and shareware is beggarware, also known    |
|   under other names.  With beggarware, the author tells you are not     |
|   obligated to send any money--the program is free--but suggests        |
|   sending a donation if you'd like to.  If a shareware author has       |
|   boundless optimism, then a beggarware author might actually be        |
|   straying into naivete.                                                |


SNEEZE   by Karl Bunker is a great little program launcher... probably the
""""""   best one available in this archive; the best of the best!  It will 
let you launch files, delete files, print and/or display TXT or AWP files, 
plus display graphics, copy files, and even unshrink files (though this 
last feature is not documented--in order to activate it, all you have to do 
is download AUTOII.BXY, file #18062, and place it in the same directory as 
Sneeze).  Also in this directory and a subdirectory are some of tools that 
Sneeze uses--or which you can use with Sneeze--or both!  We'll discuss 
these tools separately below.  Sneeze itself requires MouseText.  Freeware.

     NOTE:  The version of Sneeze available in this archive is 2.0.  You 
            can download the most recent version--v2.2--by getting 
            SNEEZE.BXY, file #21357.  This version documents and explains 
            the ability to automatically unshrink files using Sneeze.

Dogpaw   by Karl Bunker adds a command to BASIC so that you can display
''''''   and/or print text and AppleWorks word processor files.  You can 
view the file a page at a time, going forward or back, on either the 40- or 
80-column screens, and DOGPAW can also display in upper case only for you 
Apple II-Plus users.  Also, DOGPAW lets you search for a string within the 
file.  DOGPAW can read COMPRESSOR files (see below).  Sneeze uses this 
utility, but you can use it on its own or include it in your programs.  
Freeware.

Beexter   by Karl Bunker turns your text file of documentation into a
'''''''   BRUNABLE file.  You user can view your documentation on the 
screen, or print it out!  Best of all, this utility works under DOS 3.3 as 
well as ProDOS.  Freeware.

Compressor   by Karl Bunker compresses AppleWorks word processing files and
''''''''''   simple text files so that they take up less space on your 
disk.  They can still be read by DOGPAW (above), even in their compressed 
form.  Freeware.

Doc.Getter   by Karl Bunker will convert a TXT or AWP file into a
''''''''''   collection of strings for Applesoft BASIC.  This means you can 
have a BASIC program display your instructions to the user, but you can 
still have the luxury of creating those instructions in a full-fledged word 
processor.  If you want to display in 40-column mode, your file must be 21K 
or less; in 70-column mode (requires 80-column card), your file can be 24K 
or less.  Freeware.

Doc.Screener   by Karl Bunker displays the strings created by DOC.GETTER in
''''''''''''   40-column mode.  DOC.SCREENER.80 is the 70-column version, 
which requires an 80-column card.  Both are freeware.

Image2.MouseTxt   by Karl Bunker is a small BASIC program that produces a
'''''''''''''''   chart of MouseText characters on an ImageWriter II 
printer.  Freeware.

SCLU   is a SCreen Layout Utility by Karl Bunker which lets you quickly and
''''   easily design 40-column text screens, complete with MouseText if you 
want, and translates your design into a BASIC program to display the 
screen.  A big time-saver.  Freeware.


SNOOPER.SYSTEM   (File Snooper) by Jay Jennings lets you display
""""""""""""""   AppleWorks word processing files and text files.  It has a 
limit of 60 files per subdirectory.  Requires 128K and MouseText.  It's 
labelled "public domain", but the author has left a copyright notice, so we 
know that he really meant freeware.


STARTUP.F   is a simple program launcher/runner.  Yes, simpler even than
"""""""""   Koco Launcher.  This one is just 4 blocks, and all it will let 
you do is run or launch a program.  It presents a scrolling window of 12 
files.  It will try to launch SYS files, run BASIC programs, BRUN BIN 
files, EXEC TXT files, and open directories.  No author credit appears 
anywhere in this program, so we have to assume it's public domain.


ST.BYE.SYSTEM   (Saint's Bye) by St. John Morrison is a patch for the BYE
"""""""""""""   command.  It makes BYE always launch a specific program on 
a specific volume.  It includes a utility to customize ST.BYE.  When using 
the customizer, don't use the slash (/) _at all_ when entering the volume 
name.  Instead of "/HARD1/" or "/HARD1", just type "HARD1" and let ST.BYE 
take care of adding the slashes.  If you use a slash in the volume name, 
ST.BYE will refuse to accept it but it won't tell you why.  Freeware.


TYPE.CHANGER   by Jim Mensch is another program to let you change file
""""""""""""   types (but not auxtypes), and even provides a large 
scrolling list of popular.  It works extremely smoothly for a BASIC 
program--it lets you move up a directory, and you can press D to cycle 
through the online volumes--and of course, since the file types it knows 
are in DATA statements, you can easily update the program.  Freeware 
(beggarware).


TYPEUTIL   by Richard Kaapke is an extremely simple BASIC program that lets
""""""""   you type--that is, view--a text file.  You can get a catalog of 
the active disk or directory, but that display is cleared before you get to 
type in the filename... which means you have to remember how to spell it as 
you're typing it.  Still, it's free....

     That's it for this month's Treasure Hunt.  Next month, we'll take a 
look at another "Very Best of A2" archive.  If there's a particular archive 
you want examined, be sure to write and let me know!

A2 Internet Launch Pad
""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff

               >>> THE INTERNET... WITH TRAINING WHEELS <<<
               """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     As part of its ongoing Internet services, GEnie has created "launch 
pads" in key areas.  (Hey gang... where else but on GEnie does the Apple II 
hangout qualify as a key area?)  These launch pads ease you gently into the 
world of the Internet, in a slightly more organized fashion.

     More organized than _what_?  Essentially, the Internet is chaos.  
That's its great strength and great beauty.  Its chaos is what keeps 
newcomers away.  The new launch pads attempt to organize the chaos.  (Just 
a bit.  The bit at the beginning.)

     The launch pad for Apple II users is located at the main A2 menu.  
Once on GEnie, you always type "A2" or "m645" to visit the area to read 
messages, download files, or join a live chat, right?  Now there's a new 
option on that same familiar menu:


GEnie                               A2                            Page  645

    3. Gopher Resources (4 items)
    4. Newsgroups (20 items)
    5. World Wide Web Resources (12 items)
    6. Other Collections of Resources (2 items)
    7. Wide World of General Computing (36 items)
    8. Wide World of General Computing - Newsgroups (499 items)


     These all look pretty manageable, don't they?  (Except maybe that 
last one:  499 items... phew!  In fact, the last two are computer-oriented, 
not Apple II computer-oriented, so just ignore them for now.)  The largest 
number of items you have to deal with is 20!

     You all know what magazines and newsletter are, so I won't 
overexplain the first item.  If you make this choice, you'll be taken to 
the electronic home of Shareware Solutions II, a bi-monthly 20-page 
newsletter produced by Joe Kohn.  Not only can you get information about 
Shareware Solutions here, but Joe has set up a guide to these places that 
popular with Apple II folk.  It's sort of a mini-launch pad.

     The next item, "FTP Sites", is just Internet-ese for file libraries.  
Here's where you can go to download Apple II programs from the Internet.  
As of late November, you have 7 choices here, but as you'll soon find out, 
there are other places to go.

     The third item, "Gopher Resources", isn't as simply explained--but 
you'll be relieved to hear that it's easily demonstrated.  Once you try a 
gopher area, you'll see it's like running a text-based file launcher.  
There's nothing to it!

     The fourth item, "Newsgroups" points to discussion areas similar to 
the A2 RoundTable's bulletin board.  You'll find lots of public messages, 
but it may seem disorganized, even chaotic, compared to A2's message area.  
Don't worry, this feeling will pass.  Let's have a look at the newsgroups 
available:

          o  alt.emulators.ibmpc.apple2
          o  bit.listserv.apple2-l
          o  comp.answers
          o  comp.binaries.apple2
          o  comp.emulators.apple2
          o  comp.sources.apple2
          o  comp.sys.apple2
          o  comp.sys.apple2.comm
          o  comp.sys.apple2.gno
          o  comp.sys.apple2.marketplace
          o  comp.sys.apple2.programmer
          o  comp.sys.apple2.usergroups
          o  tri.comp.apple
          o  uiuc.sys.apple2
          o  zer.z-netz.rechner.apple.allgemein
          o  zer.z-netz.rechner.apple.binaer
          o  zer.z-netz.rechner.apple.hardware
          o  zer.z-netz.rechner.apple.programmieren
          o  zer.z-netz.rechner.apple.spiele
          o  zer.z-netz.rechner.apple.viren

(Those last six groups are for the German-speaking among us, by the way.  
Remember, the Internet is global in nature.  On GEnie, the vast majority of 
denizens are from North America, usually the United States.  There's 
nothing that says the Internet has to be that way!)

     The fifth item, "World Wide Web Resources" will point you to many of 
the Apple II oriented electronic homes, or "home pages" on the Internet.  
If you've gotten this far, you'll have noticed that every path you follow 
seems to have other paths leading from it.  Sometimes you'll find that 
following the paths leads you in a circle!  Not to worry, you're not doomed 
to travel the same ground forever.  Just pick a different path next time.

     If you've noticed that each link along the way leads you to different 
links, you'll understand why it's almost impossible to ever tame or 
organize the Internet.  But these launch pads can help.  You can always 
return here if things get confusing, and start from first principles.

     A note for the mildly advanced:  When you're using the launch pad, 
you're actually running a special version of Lynx, a web-browser.  Under 
normal circumstances, Lynx will let you press G to manually type the name 
of the next place you want to visit.  This is not possible when using the 
launch pad, but don't be discouraged!  Once you've comfortable enough with 
Lynx to try this, you should visit GEnie's main Internet area.  Here you 
can use a full-fledged version of Lynx that WILL permit you to decide where 
you want to go!

     As soon as you get to feeling overwhelmed, all you have to do to 
leave the launch pad is type "Q".  You'll be returned to GEnie's A2 area.  
On familiar ground at last!

             PAUG MEETING REPORT /
/////////////////////////////////
Report of November 1995 Meeting
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



EDITOR'S NOTE   We regret that the full PAUG Newsletter is not available
"""""""""""""   this month.  Instead we present a brief summary of the 
                monthly PAUG meeting for November.  Ray Pasold will be back 
                with the PAUG newsletter next month--look for it here!


WHAT IS PAUG?   The mission of the Planetary Apple User Group (PAUG) is to 
"""""""""""""   serve as the online heart of the worldwide Apple II 
community.  PAUG's goals include providing help and support for anyone who 
may not have a local user group nearby, and for user groups that want a 
virtual link to the Heart of the Apple II world.  Creating a link between 
PAUG and both the online and offline user group community is one of our 
priorities.  PAUG sponsorship of an online user group is focused on 
promoting the fact that the Apple II is not only still alive, but doing 
very well.

     PAUG meets the third Sunday of every month at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time 
in the Apple II RoundTable (A2) Real Time Conference (RTC) area.  Type 
"m645;2" to join in the discussion.

                                 [*][*][*]


     November's PAUG meeting focussed on using the A2 with other 
platforms.  Not only can you transfer data to your Apple II from a MS-DOS 
machine or a Macintosh (or vice versa), but you can create a network of 
Apple II and other computers that share the same printers and other devices 
(like CD-ROMs).  The most common network is the AppleTalk network.  Once 
the network is activated on your Apple II, you must also turn on file 
sharing on your Macintosh.  This done, you can use your Apple II to run 
programs that are stored on the Macintosh's hard drive!  (Apple II 
programs, of course, not Macintosh programs!)

     Another popular issue is how to use graphics from Macintosh areas on 
the Apple II.  Of course, most Mac graphic formats are not compatible with 
the Apple II, but you can run into problems with GIF graphics, even though 
they can be read on any machine.  The problem arises because of the 
Macbinary header that sometimes gets attached to GIFs.  To get rid of it, 
you can download the graphic using the commercial telecommunications 
software Spectrum v2.0, if you own it, or you can process the file with 
file #24744, MACBIN.BXY.  After stripping the MacBinary header, you may 
need to change the filetype so that you GIF program will recognize the 
graphic.

     Other gems overhead during the PAUG meeting were:

     "The guy that made Prism lives near me but he does not like the apple 
II any more."  (Heh heh heh.  We know where you live, guy.)

     "Actually, I think that it would be best if GEnie was bought."  
(Finally!  An optimist!)

     "You were trying to print a 3200, and that can't be done."  (That 
used to be true, but John Wrenholt of Big Red Computer Club has just 
released a utility to do just that!  Download file #26092, PRINT3200.BXY.)

     This month's meeting will be on Sunday, December 10, from 7 p.m. to 9 
p.m. Eastern time, and PAUG will be celebrating Sights and Sounds of the 
Season.  Last year PAUG brought in several guest speakers to our December 
online meeting, and it was a rousing success!  Each brought their own 
special talents to bear on demonstrating how well the Apple II family of 
computers can help you celebrate the holidays, and we barely scratched the 
surface on all the wonderful things you can do with your computer to help 
bring the holiday spirit home to those you love.

     This year, PAUG is determined to outdo itself.  We've invited our 
friends from last year, and we have also uncovered some new talent as well! 
Whether your interests lay in playing (or creating!) holiday music on the 
Apple II, using Christmas and Hanukkah fonts and graphics to make cards, 
invitations, gift tags, or placecards for the holiday table, or even just 
finding neat little holiday images to bring the spirit of the season to 
your own personal computing environment, we'll have the best tips, tricks, 
and answers for you at the December PAUG meeting!  Remember:  Sunday, 
December 10, from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST.
