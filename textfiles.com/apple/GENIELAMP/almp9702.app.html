                      >>> LOOKING FORWARD AND BACKWARD <<<
                          """"""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Before I became editor of this publication, I had a number of email
conversations with Doug Cuff, my predecessor.  One of the things that we
discussed was his typing up some "notes" for me on how to put _GenieLamp A2_
together.  A few weeks before the first issue of _GenieLamp A2_ that had my name
as editor was to be published, Doug sent me his "notes" via email.  I used
Shrinkit to unpack them, saw that it was an Appleworks Word Pprocessor file, and
used a macro I had written some time ago to load it into Appleworks and print it
out, while I headed for my morning shower.

     I came back to see my printer had run out of paper.  Turns out that Doug's
"notes" were 128k of an Appleworks Word Processor file that printed out to 55
pages.

     All of this merely serves to point out again that Doug did a remarkable job
as editor of this publication.  I knew it would take a lot of my time to get
GenieLamp together on a monthly basis, but I didn't think it would be quite
_this_ much time.  It was, therefore, a disappointment to me that I wasn't able
to match the size of the previous issues of GenieLamp in my debut issue, nor was
I able to reprint all of the messages that I really wanted to, largely due to
the fact that I was surprised by the time constraints.

     However, as I've been known to say, "If it don't kill you, it'll only make
you stronger," I enter my second issue as editor a little more prepared, a
little wiser, and a lot more experienced.  Work on GenieLamp this month is
starting earlier than usual: in fact, it's starting on New Year's Day.  I guess
you could say my resolution is to make sure GenieLamp lives up to its quality
standard.

     Now to see about getting the day extended to thirty hours. . .

                                   [*][*][*]


     Sometimes, you get Christmas presents from unexpected shores.  As many of
you know, _GenieLamp A2Pro_ is no longer being published.  What you may _not_
know is that before there was a _GenieLamp A2Pro_, _GenieLamp A2_ covered
happenings in _both_ the A2 and A2Pro RoundTables on GEnie.  I had toyed with
the idea of incorporating some A2Pro coverage into _GenieLamp A2_ again, but had
thought that it might be best to first get my feet wet in trying to continue
what we had going already before expanding.

     So it came as a very pleasant surprise when, on December 30, 1996, a
package arrived in email from my favorite Australian programmer.  I unwrapped it
to find what turned out to be a special Christmas present for the readers of
_GenieLamp A2_.

     Richard Bennett, the world famous programmer of _Express_, _GraphicWriter
III_, the _Spectrum_ ANSI display, and an assortment of other Apple II products,
had taken the time to skim the A2Pro Bulletin Board over the last few months and
compile a selection of choice postings for presentation in GenieLamp.  I was
blown away by the effort he had made with his busy schedule.  My thanks,
Richard, and I'm sure that the readers of _GenieLamp A2_ will thank you as well.

                                   [*][*][*]


     It's been pretty common that _GenieLamp A2_ has had some great guest
writers, but in this issue, we welcome a true celebrity to our electronic pages:
Max Jones, editor and publisher of _Juiced.GS_, the Apple IIgs specific
newsletter, has contributed a special column for this issue.

     I've been writing a regular column for Max since the first issue of
_Juiced.GS_, and I had the pleasure of meeting Mad Max in person at Kansasfest
1996, along with a bunch of other Apple II luminaries.  Max went from being a
total newcomer on the Apple IIgs scene to a well-known publisher of a
well-respected publication in less than a year.  I'm sure he'd agree that life
hasn't been the same since.

     It's been often said that the Apple II was the computer that changed the
world.  Publishing _Juiced.GS_ certainly changed Max's world, and writing for
_Juiced.GS_ certainly changed mine.  Here's hoping that Max's column in this
issue changes your world too.

                                   [*][*][*]


     Another columns update: I had hoped to have the FILE BANDWAGON column back
in this issue; it's not.  I'm hoping to have it back again next issue, but
whether or not that will happen remains to be seen (I don't like the taste of
leather enough to have it every month).

     And Peter Brickell's still dealing with The Real World, so REAL WORLD APPLE
continues on hiatus.

A couple of days ago, someone (it may have been Mark Wade) posted a message in
the BB about wanting to see the Defender of the World game demo uploaded here.
I've had this game demo on my hard drive since it was released as freeware last
fall by author David Ong Tat-Wee of Singapore.

So, I packed it up in the proper format and uploaded to the A2 RT Library this
evening (Wednesday). When it clears inspection, it should be available for
download as file #28252.

The game itself is far from finished, and it may never be finished. But one
level is playable, and portions of the other levels are available for
inspection. It =is= fun to tinker with. Too bad the author doesn't have time to
complete the project.

Enjoy!

DO-IT-YOURSELF .FL FILES   Don, Bob: Sometime when I first acquired the
""""""""""""""""""""""""   LaserJet (1/95?) I did upload a Harmonie .FL file for
it but doubt that is what I am using today. I presently have TT/PCL mappings as
follows:  Courier/Courier(22), Garamond/Garamond(156),  Geneva/Omega(3),
Arial/Arial(19867), Monoco/UniversMed(4),  Symbol/Symbol(23),
Times/CGTimes(20), ZapfChanc/Marigold(18),  ZapfDing/Wingdings(13),
Aspire/Coronet(2418). The numbers represent IIGS font families in decimal. These
typefaces now print instantly via Harmonie EXTERNAL without the long dreadful
delays.

Am sure the mix of built-in fonts is different on the InkJets, but the principal
is probably the same. Basically each entry in the xxx.FL table looks like this:

(For example, Aspire)
           byte 0-1     Family number in HEX              72 09
           byte 2         Length of print command       0A
           byte 3-n     Print command in CHAR           <esc>(slp4116T

Don't forget the GS's bizarre need for placing the L/O byte of family number in
the rightmost position (as in 2418 = 0972 above) ;^{  You will need a  block
editor of some sort to set this up properly.

I suppose if you could find a bit mapped or TT font for LetterGothic, you could
simply replace the family ID for Geneva (03 00 in bytes 0-1) with whatever is
correct for LetterGothic in the xxx.FL table you are using. See previous post.

Usually, Apple II stuff is packed in a NuFX format, with or without a Binary II
wrapper.

If you're grabbing stuff off of the 'net, it is sometimes also Binscii'd,
Binhex'd, or UUencoded (or otherwise textually encoded).  A number of Apple II
programs can handle some or all of these formats, including GSCII+, Speckie 2.1,
and Binscii.

And you ought to do the unpacking on a IIgs.

>>>>>   Re: Changing slots in P8
"""""
I feel I need to comment on what's going on here.

Or, at least what I _think_ is going on here :)  If the idea is to swap the
entries in the P8 device driver list, read on...  If it isn't, then forget the
whole rest of this msg while I pull my foot out of my mouth :)

P8 stores its device driver table at $BF10 thru $BF2F.  If I recall correctly,
the goal is to swap slot 5 with slot 7.  The quick and dirty method is to take
the contents of $BF1A/1B and swap them with $BF1E/1F assuming drive 1 in both
cases.  Depending on the device driver(s) in question, this might work.  Here's
the problem tho:  The MLI sets up a command block (device driver parameter list)
prior to calling the device driver.  One of those parameters in the command
block is UNIT NUMBER (found at $43) which is in the format: %DSSS0000, where D
is the drive number minus one, and SSS is the slot number.  OK?  Keep this in
mind.     Next, let's take a look at the hardware side.  Most external cards can
be plugged into any slot and work.  The easiest way to communicate with a card
is to read/write at the slot hardware _base_ address, using the X-Register to
specify the actual slot offset.  For example, the assembly language instruction
LDA $C080,X  where X=$10 would access slot 1.  If X=$20, then the access would
be to slot 2, etc.  So, the people who write device drivers, only need a base
address ($C080) and where their card is at (loaded in the X-Reg).  Now, let's
put the two together.

1.  The device driver needs the X-Register to be set to the slot number.
2.  The MLI issues the slot number as part of the Unit Number.

Hmmm...If you were a device driver, where would you get that slot number??? :)
And everythings fine until.... someone _swaps_ the entries in the P8 device
driver table and _doesn't_ tell P8 about it :(

Say you have a 3.5 drive on slot 5, and a SCSI card in slot 7, and you swap the
device drivers.  =Potentially= you have the 3.5 driver accessing the SCSI card,
and the SCSI driver accessing the 3.5 drive.  +NOT+ what you want!!!  AND- I
don't even want to think about what would happen if the two swapped entries
refered to different devices, i.e. a serial device and a block device.  Yikes!

So, I can be wrong on this, because not all device drivers are written the same
way.  Maybe it'll work for you, but I wanted to at least inform you that the
results may prove disasterous.  Also, since I'm jumping in here, maybe I drew
the wrong conclusion about where this discussion was going to go, and in that
case Sorry!

BTW, I'm currently writing a P8 device driver to control an IDE HD with multiple
partitions, which the user may map into unused P8 slots.  (like the RamFAST).
The basic theory is to fill the unused P8 device driver vectors with my device
driver entry point and then translate the different Unit Numbers passed by the
MLI into the correct partition, there by creating virtual drives.  If someone
tried to swap the entries, nothing would happen because the entries are the
same-- it's the Unit Number that makes the difference.

So, basicly, hot swapping the device driver entries is a BAD idea, in my
opinion, of course :)

Currently, what cards are in slots 5 and 7, respectively, and how many devices

I whipped up a short program that will correctly handle the slot 5/slot 7 swap
problem.  This program applies a patch to P8 that will intercept calls to slot
5/7, fix the Unit Number, then passes (redirects) control to the opposite slot.
When the program is launched, it will relocate itself between the BI and the
buffers, so it is protected from other programs. The patch must be applied each
time Prodos is launched, but never twice in the same session.  I'm emailing you

<<<<<   Hugh and Sully,
"""""
Actually, that's exactly what I want to streamline -- the HD backup process.
Here's what I've got:

The machine is a Laser 128EX with an expansion box, so I've got two available
expansion slots -- slot 5 and slot 7.  Each slot is controlled by a hardware
switch.  If I switch slot 5 "on", I can only access 128K of ram, and since I use
AppleWorks a lot, slot 5 remains dedicated to ram.  If I switch slot 7 "on", I
lose access to any 3.5" drive connected to the external drive port (a 5 1/4"
drive simply responds to s6,d2, but a 3.5" drive is addressed as s7,d1 -- same
port).  So the problem is that I have three "devices" (1 MB of ram, HD, and 3.5"
drive) competing for two resources, but I only ever need any two of them at the
same time.

In normal use, I have 1 MB of extended ram tying up slot 5 and an Apple High-
Speed SCSI card in slot 7.  For the occasions when I need to transfer a file to
(or from) a 3.5" drive, I simply set up a ramdisk, temporarily move the file (or
disk) to the ramdrive, flip the switch, and reboot. Although this is fine for
the occasional transfer, it's not conducive to making even a single backup.
Backups to a 3.5" disk are not imposssible, but I have to physically move the
SCSI controller temporarily to slot 5 first.  I want to avoid having to move the
controller back and forth.  Up until now, I've done that at the expense of
making any backups.

What's frustrating is that when I use a program like Copy-II-Plus, the 3.5"
drive activity light comes on for a moment as all the drives are polled, it just
never shows up in the list of drives to be accessed until I switch slot 7 "off"
-- but then I can't access the HD.

After reading Sully's explanation of what needs to happen, I fear that remapping
the slot won't provide a solution since that will probably remap the external
drive port to slot 5 as well.  :-(

>>>>>   I don't have (8-bit) AppleWorks, but I do have a Floptical and the

 * Cold Boot with a disk in the Floptical drive.  RF acts a lot better when
   it knows about the Floptical from the start.

 * Once you're booted up, go into the RF Utilities and make sure your
   Floptical disk is recognized, and that it's marked as ACTIVE.  At this
   time you can also note your SCSI IDs.

I believe the problem is the manual mapping.  I wrestled with this problem while
trying to get my PCT to work w/the Floptical.  ProDOS seems to re-map volumes
upon entry to P8.  What I noticed is that ProDOS replaced my Floptical with
/RAM3.  (Using a CDA such as File-a-Trix is handy for listing what volumes are
considered on-line when you're in P8)

The only solution is to arrange your SCSI IDs in such a way that the all of the
volumes (Floptical, HD partitions, etc.) that you NEED to appear in P8 do so
with auto-mapping and don't exceed P8's 12 volume limit.  This eliminates the
need for manual mapping.  How much changing you have to do depends on your
setup.  :/

I set my Floptical ID between my boot drive and my 2nd (bigger) drive. Since
there are 3 partitions on my boot drive, the Floptical appears as the 4th volume
and shows up in P8 just fine.

<<<<<   Wily (and anyone else with a RamFAST)
"""""
Playing around with Wily's recommendations, I stumbled upon the following
procedure for getting RamFAST to automagically recognize any disk in the
Floptical drive under P8.  It has interesting implications for users of other
removable media drives, I am sure.

1) Shut off the GS

2) Insert an unformatted disk (or disk from an inactive FST) into the
Floptical drive.

3) Boot the GS into the RamFAST Utilities by holding the zero key down. What you
should see on the right-hand side is your usual list of volumes, except that for
the Floptical drive, you should see a generic volume name based on the SCSI ID
of the Floptical device.  On my system, this generic name is CVTECH.ID4.A (The
device name is CVTECH.S7.F).

4) Map the generic volume name into an empty slot.  What you will find at this
point is that any disk that you put into the Floptical drive will be mapped to
the same slot to which you mapped the generic volume name.

I stumbled into this when I put a HD disk from GNN into the Floptical drive.
Curiously, Finder polled the drive, and did nothing with it.  No Icon, no error
message.  I went into RamFAST Utilities, and there was the generic volume ID.
Further analysis with UniverseMaster and UtilityWorksGS seem to indicate that
the disk name has 'illegal' characters that aren't recognized by the MS-DOS FST.
I have 2 AOL disks with the same syndrome.  I have been able to format these
with RamFAST Utilities where GSOS programs won't.

I was able to reproduce the sequence above by deactivating the MS-DOS FST prior
to shutting off the GS, and using an MS-DOS disk in the Floptical drive when I
booted it into RamFAST Utilities.

what we had so far, to give folks an idea of what could have been.

I have opened a set of topics in Category 29 (Topics 44 through 50) for
discussion of Jasmine.  Although we won't be officially supporting it due to its
pre-release status, many of us will still be wandering through from time to time
and will be happy to answer questions, and many of you will be able to share
your experiences with Jasmine to help each other get the most out of it.

In any case, keep an eye on Category 29, Topics 44 to 50, for discussion of
Jasmine, and feel free to post there if you have a question or concern.

Regardless of being a "pre-release" package, Jasmine is still pretty impressive
as it stands, so I'm sure you'll want to try it out, if you haven't already!
I'm a little late getting these topics opened... Jasmine was actually uploaded
to the library about a week ago.  In that week, it's
already had 81 downloads!

COPILOT 2.5.6 FOR ANSITERM RELEASED
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
                   ############ NEWS FLASH #############

CoPilot for ANSITerm version 2.5.6 has been uploaded to the A2 Library.  If all
goes well, it should be file # 28292.

This is a maintenance release of the ANSITerm scripts, in a complete package.
Those of you who have CoPilot 2.5.5 for ANSITerm and have installed the update
scripts already have part of this package, but there are lots of minor tweaks
and changes in this release, too.  Among the more interesting:

+ The archive is _not_ a disk archive, so you can unpack it to any hard drive
partition, floppy disk, or RAM disk that has enough space (642K).  It unpacks to
a folder named 'ATCOP.Install'.

+ The CoPilot application has been patched to allow you to paste addresses into
the mail address field.  You must copy the address to the clipboard prior to
selecting GE mail from the Message menu.

+ The CoPilot documentation has been edited to include information about the
ANSITerm version.  Other editing has been done to update this file; it includes
the changes added in version 2.5.6.  A companion document called 'AT.delta.DOC'
is laid out in parallel to the CoPilot documentation, and explains where the
ANSITerm version differs from the documentation that applies to the other
CoPilot versions.  This file also contains a complete list of all the tweaks,
bug fixes and changes that have been made since the initial release of CoPilot
for ANSITerm v2.5.5 in the summer of 1995.

+ The main action scripts have been modified so that you can edit a few lines
near the end of the script, and choose what colors are displayed for the
foreground and background.  The color settings are listed in a table at the end
of each of these scripts.

+ Some of the menus accessed from the CoPilot Main off-line menu have been
rearranged to agree with the CoPilot documentation (and to be the same as the
other CoPilot implementations).

+ The scripts have 'hooks' for all of the additional ANSITerm scripts that I
have uploaded to the A2 library, _plus_ an additional script hook that was in
the other implementations of CoPilot, but not in the ANSITerm version.  See the
AT.delta.DOC documentation for a description of how these script hooks work.

+ If you have Attached Mail waiting and skip it, you will get a message each
time you log on reminding you that it is there.  This message will disappear the
next time you download Attached Mail.


Enjoy!

OLRIGHT! UPDATE
"""""""""""""""
                             OLRight! News...

I have spent a bit of time today working on OLRight!  Today's activities,
combined with things I have done since the first upload, lead me to believe that
the next upload will be for/with WriteAway, probably by next week-end.

First, some reports:

Joachim Nelson has had difficulties in installing OLRight! so that the scripts
would run.  He got a message that corresponds to a bad pathname error. The 'fix'
was to make a fresh installation of ANSITerm and install OLRight! again.
Joachim had put OLRight! in the same folder as his CoPilot installation.  I have
not tested this configuration, so don't know if there is a compatibility
problem.

Skip Helbig reports that the scripts broke on a line that reads:
    as bk de * Destructive backspace
I have not gotten confirmation from Skip yet, but I suspect that he is running a
version of AT earlier than v2.13b, which is what I have.  Since this is not a
critical setting, I am commenting it out where I find it.

Skip also reports a perceived increase in system instability, especially in
using Hermes, since installing Instant Replay.  I have offered some thoughts,
but don't know Skip's situation yet.


                      UPDATES IN THE WINGS

I have the following up and running on my system:

-- Instant Replay scripts --

o  Converted several scripts for use with Write Away. Conversion consists of
substituting Command-\ for Command-S or Command-H for save/save as; and
substituting Command-W for Command-K to close windows.  Minor tweak to the
find/unmark script.  Hermes scripts will be included in the next archive in a
separate folder.

o  Script to 'select all' and set font to CoPilot 8

o  Extract (cut) highlighted text to a new archive file with user-defined name.
Script is in both :OLR:Archive:Mail and OLR:Archive:Forums folders,  so you can
select where the text is archived.

o  Print highlighted text.  The text is copied to a new (unsaved) file and
printed; user has to close file at conclusion of print (at least so far).

-- Message Searches --

The Off-Line setup menu now has routines for setting up forum 'searches'.  The
current options are:

o  Reset pointers in a SIG for last fifty messages or to a specific message
number.  Useful when setting up a new SIG.

o  IGNORE all messages having a common subject (actually, a specific word or
words in the subject) in a forum.  Useful for suppressing messages for threads
that you are not interested in.  These settings are kept until you change or
delete them.

o  Read a specific message number

o  Read messages resulting from a search.  Options include combinations of:

      Search all messages or a range of messages
      Specify author of message
      Specify starting date for search
      Specify text to match in subjects (threads) of messages
      Specify entire message, or # of lines of each message to retrieve

o  Read all messages in a thread.

-- Login/Logoff --

o  If you telnet in, the scripts can log you off (You need to edit the .EX and
.TN scripts for your ISP prompts/commands).

o  Message displayed that password was sent (cosmetic).

o  Changed timeout for each dial to 2 minutes (was 1 minute).

-- Conferences ---

o  Added missing quote which broke script
o  Changed references for A2 and A2Pro to non-custom
o  Added 3-second pause before asking for which room, since dialog may cover the
room number.

-- Globals --

o  Added check/finish ASCII receive to global-c.  This is for when scripts
break.  It closes open files and finishes any receives in progress.

o  Fixed global-q to properly exit conference

o  Deleted global-x, global-p, which were for CoPilot

There may be more... :^)

                         """""""""""""""""""""""""""""

THE LEMMINGS ARE HERE!   As of the end of 1996, the completed "Brutal
""""""""""""""""""""""   Deluxe's LemminGS" game is in the hands of the beta
test team. Once they've had a chance to thoroughly put the game through its
paces and then give us the go-ahead, we'll start to ship it. We expect to get
the 'beta team thumbs up' in the next few days...

Of course, if any last minute problems are discovered, they'll have to be fixed
first.

>> When it is released, do you intend to distribute it 'electronically' to
>> those who have purchased "Convert 3200"?

When it is released, "Brutal Deluxe's LemminGS" will weigh in at nearly 2
megabytes in size, and that makes it just much too large to transmit
electronically. It will ship on three 3.5" disks.

As stated all along, Brutal Deluxe's LemminGS is a "limited edition game" that
will only be available to those who have purchased Convert 3200. There are,
however, a few exceptions...

Those Genie members who attended the Brutal Deluxe RTC in March, 1996 will be
eligible to acquire the game from SSII for the $5 s/h fee. Olivier Zardini kept
a list of those who attended that RTC, and he'll be sending me that list soon.

SSII conducted a Desktop Publishing Contest last year, and winners of that
contest were awarded copies of Convert 3200. Those winners are also eligible to
get Brutal Deluxe's LemminGS from SSII for the same $5 s/h fee.

Convert 3200 costs $15.

Brutal Deluxe's LemminGS is free, but Brutal Deluxe has authorized SSII to
charge $5 to cover the cost of disks, labels, mailers and postage to anywhere in
the galaxy.

So...for 20 bucks, you can get the fastest graphics conversion program ever
released for the IIGS, and a phenomenal game. Such a deal!!

weeks ago, 50 bucks could have gotten you 17 shrink-wrapped games. Or, it could

"""""   version of Brutal Deluxe's LemminGS crashed my system within 10 seconds
of launching it. A flurry of e-mails to Brutal Deluxe ensued, and I was in
contact with a number of the beta-test team, all of whom swore up and down that
the "final" version of LemminGS worked just fine.

Since none of the other previous 20 versions misbehaved in the least bit on my
system, a bit of detective work was required. I finally spotted 3 files that had
been modified since the last beta version, and noticed that one of them was 5
bytes shorter. I insisted that Brutal Deluxe look at that file, and sure
enough...those 5 bytes were critical to the program.

I just downloaded the update, and...

Brutal Deluxe's LemminGS will start to ship on Monday, January 13, 1997.

It's completed, it works great, and I think it's the most enjoyable game I've
ever played on my IIGS! I think you'll agree...

Normally when I'm doing my file releasing chores I'll take a quick look at the

back and play some more if I liked it. Well, ummm, ::cough::, this time I played
all 10 demo levels before I suddenly realized that I'd better go release the
file so others could check it out. For those of you who had to wait a few extra
hours for the demo (even though you would never have known without me telling
you this), I apologize. :)

Being a Second Sight owner, I have very little use for Convert 3200 even though
I hear it's a great program. But LemminGS looks so darned good, and is so fun to
play, that I'm going to buy Convert 3200 anyway so I can play the remaining 80+
LemminGS levels.

Well, gang, this is my last night on Genie.

After something more than 8 years, I'm leaving.

I was tempted to post this with my original DISPATCHER account (which has  had a
name change to SOAPY.SUE and is being used by The Lovely Susan).

(Come to think of it, the ORIGINAL name on that account was G.UTTER.)

I want to talk about all the good times I've had here, I want to reminisce about
so many of the friends I've made here (many of whom left a long time ago), I
want to say a LOT of things, but there doesn't seem to be much point. I'll just
start crying, and won't be able to read the screen anyway.

I'm on Delphi now, committed to Delphi now. I'm over there because I believe
very strongly that Genie is doomed, that Genie will die in mere months. I can't
bear to watch. It's been hard enough already.

If Apple II support has a future, its on Delphi. Genie only has a past.

That's a hard thing to say, and many of you won't want to hear it, or accept it,
but I think it is true.

(I certainly wouldn't leave if I didn't.)

I don't know what I mean to say here, and I know I'm not doing it well, but this
is HARD people, REAL hard.

I'm not going to say how much I'll miss you all, because I really hope that you
all will join me on Delphi.

GO COM A2                                        APPLE II FOREVER!!!!

THOSE WACKY JPEGS   About a year (or so) ago, Tony Ward helped me figure out
"""""""""""""""""   how to determine the dimensions of a Jpeg.  Shortly after
that a crash took away the code and information, anyone have the file format
information around?

About all I remember is that it's something wacky where I had to loop around
looking for some marker bytes, but that's about all I remember (and I'm not even
positive I'm remembering THAT right, could have been another file format <grin>)

>>>>>   Well, at least this time the information will be permanantly
"""""   archived in a known location... :)

Basically, you process a JPEG by looking for markers. You should first check
that the file actually is a JPEG by looking at the very beginning of the file.
It should start with $FFD8 FFE0 aabb 4A46494600 ccdd.

$FFD8 is the beginning marker. All JPEGs should start with these two bytes.
$FFE0 should come next (it does in all JPEGs I've seen, but I'm not sure if it's
always the case.) aabb are length bytes that I'll explain later. $4A46494600
spells "JFIF" with a $00 terminator (call it a C-String if you like, but it's
always the same in a valid JPEG.) ccdd is the version number ($0102 would be
v1.2.)

Once you've determined that the file is a valid JPEG, you need to search for the
"Start Of Frame" marker. It will be a $FF followed by $Cn (it can be anything
from $C0 to $CF =except= $C4 and $CC.) For our purposes, you don't care what n
is as long as you find it (it defines the compression process.)

The bytes immediately following $FFCn are as follows:

2 bytes: length
1 byte : precision
2 bytes: height
2 bytes: width
1 byte : number of components

You are interested in height and width. Note that the 2-byte values are in MSB
first format. Thus, $013C = 316 decimal.

You may be asking "what if $FFCn occurs naturally somewhere in the data?" Well,
that's where those length bytes come in. To properly parse a JPEG, you really
should scan from the beginning looking for $FF markers and skip ahead the number
of length bytes to find the next marker. An important point here is that the
length bytes =always= directly follow the marker bytes and =always= include the
2 length bytes themselves.

I'm terrible at explaining things. I hope you can make sense of all this. Let me
try to sum up...

1) All JPEGs should start with $FFD8.

2) Directly after that will be another $FFxx marker. All $FFxx markers
   =except= the very first $FFD8 identifier will be followed by a 2-byte
   length in MSB first format.

3) Scan for the $FFxx markers, skipping ahead using the length bytes until
   you find a $FFCn marker and grab the data explained above.

FOCUS NON-ADB KEYBOARDS   To anyone who can help!  Hardware Hacker, Solder
"""""""""""""""""""""""   Slinger? I was just given a beautiful extended

that was wrong was that the 3v Lithium Battery underneath was dead.  A $3.00
Radio Shack purchase fixed that.  Now the calculator and the liquid crystal

smaller 4 pin Din.  Can I replace keyboards on my Apple IIGS? If so how do I

Mike pointed out that this was probably a Wintel keyboard and did not have ADB
support.

ADB is the Apple Desktop Bus, and it means that any device you plug into a IIgs
(or Mac for that matter) ADB port, must have smart logic inside to support the
Bus. Wintel keyboards support different logic...

What you need to do is swap it with some poor Wintel owner for a Macintosh
extended keyboard...

MIME AT LAST   Call to arms!  Well, fingers to be precise...
""""""""""""
Don't know if there's a better topic for this, I may create one depending on the
response.

I've had a bit of feedback about how we don't have a MIME decoder for the Apple
II. I'm assuming we still don't.

Anyway, over the weekend I knocked up a very basic shell for a MIME decoder
application with plug in decoders. I've also written a decoder for quoted-
printable and will be releasing the source as sample code.

So if anyone is interested in writing a decoder for any MIME types (eg. BASE64,
BINHEX etc.) then let me know, as the shell is pretty much done except for
niceties, and the plug-in module format for decoders is VERY simple, in the fact
the shell does all the hard work for you.

One last thing, this is in 65C02, so it'll run on //es and //cs as well as the
IIGS.

Now, where are all those programmers who said they had decoders but no
application shell to drive them? I don't have the time to write any others, so
we need these people to step forward.

I was planning on doing an Base64 decoder for 8-bit machines.  I've started to
pull together the references but I haven't finished the specifications
(features, etc.).

I once investigated doing a BinHex decoder for the IIgs (command for the ORCA
shell) but I had trouble with the CRC value in the BinHex headers I was working
with.  I lifted C source code for 16-bit CRC from two different PC
communications books and the CRC values I calculated never matched the ones in
the header (I was doing this to ensure the integrity of the BinHex data I was
about to process).  Both examples, used precalculated values that were
stored in tables for direct look-up.  All of this C work was being done on the
PC (because the development environment is easier and faster to work with)
before it would be ported to the IIgs.

That's good news.  I was assuming that you or someone else was going to do a
IIgs-specific Base64 decoder so I was planning on a 6502 version with an
Applesoft front-end (because doing user interface from assembler has always been
a pain for me).

Actually, I think it would be rather nice if the base64 decoder could sense that
the data was of a particular type (such as GIF, JPEG, TIFF) and automagically
save the data with the appropriate file type and aux type.  If my information is
correct, GIF would get assigned to $C0/$8006, JPEG to $C0/$0081, and TIFF to
$C0/$0080.

I read on csa2 that Brutal Deluxe lost the entire source code for their version

INTEGER BASIC UPGRADED   Integer BASIC 1.0.2
""""""""""""""""""""""   -------------------

Integer BASIC has been upgraded.  The upgrade fixes both known bugs in this
small sample compiler.

Integer BASIC is a small demonstration compiler written in Pascal and assembly
language.  It comes with source code and a book that gives a brief introduction
to compilers.

Just $30.00, it's worth the price for the classics disk, which revives old
Integer BASIC programs--some written by Woz himself--running in compiled 65816
native code!

The upgrade is $5 to registered owners of ORCA/Integer BASIC.  The upgrade is
free if you are ordering anything else.

PROGRAMMING IN PASCAL QUESTIONS   Hopefully, someone can help me out here.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
I'm slowly working my way through Mike Westerfield's "Programming the Toolbox in
Pascal", and I've got a few questions.

 1.  On page 86 in chapter 5, (the Windows chapter), at the bottom of the page,
there is an example function to open a new window. In the constants section of
the function is the following:

 const
        rWindParam1 = $800E;   {resource ID}
        wrNum = 1001;          {window resource number}

The comments are what bother me, and I'm thinking it's just a semantics problem.
It seems to me that  rWindParam1 should be the window resource number (or
resource _type_), and wrNum should be the resource ID, especially since on page
403, it shows the resource type  being the second to last parameter passed.  Are
the comments on page 83 a typo? (I hope so, or I _really_ don't understand  this
stuff  ;)

2.  I'm trying to concurrently use DesignMaster to develop my resources for
windows, menus etc, but when I create a window in DesignMaster, it wants to put
the window title in a rPstring resource, which doesn't hurt my feelings any, but
how do I make the NewWindow2 call from the pascal side then?

3.  Can you freely mix and match hex and decimal in the resource definitions and
toolbox calls?  It seemed that when we were defining the menus in Chapter 3, we
were using decimal numbers for the resource IDs, but when we got to the windows
chapter, we suddenly switched to using hex numbers in the calls and definitions.

Thanks for any insight you might have.

>>>>>   I'm not familiar with Mike's manual, however you are correct in
"""""   assuming that (rWindParam1 = $800E) is in fact a resource type, and
(wrNum = 1001) is a resource ID. Unless of course Mike's trying hard to confuse
the hell out of people, which I seriously doubt. :)

As for DesignMaster, again Mike will be able to comment better, but it was
designed as a prototyping tool (specifically for the Dialog Manager), and not a
resource editor. If you can, try and find where you can buy a copy of Genesys.
It's a little buggy, but not as buggy as DesignMaster, and was written with
resources in mind.

All toolbox calls accept hexdecimal values. It is at the compiler or assembly
level where the base differs. For example, in pascal, the following two
statements would be equivalent:

   myVariable := 10;

   myVariable := $0A;

When the compiler generates code, the 10 is translated to $000A.

So basically, you can use whatever base you're comfortable with, although we're
taught to count in base 10, so why not stick to it. What you may have seen is an
example where it is handy to use hexadecimal. For example, say you had a window
with a control list, and the control list's ID was $00000001, you could group
the controls for that list together by merging them with $0001, so you would
have a list of control with IDs such as:

 $00010001
 $12340001
 $43210001
 $10030001

Going back, you can easily see that they're grouped together. In decimal, their
values would be

 65537
 305397761
 1126236161
 268632065  (OK, I specifically picked a horrid example. :-)

You can define them with either base, but hexadecimal just makes for sense.

Thanks so much for your quick and helpful reply.  The bit about the control list
went a little over my head, but I haven't gotten to that chapter yet, so perhaps
it will be clear when I do.

Quick Click Morph

     If you've watched a transformation scene in a recent movie, commercial, or
even a television show, then chances are you've seen morphing.  Morph is short
for metamorphosis--a complete change of form, structure, or substance.  It's
visually arresting to see something--animal, mineral, or vegetable--stretch
and/or fall in on itself to form something new.

     The first time I saw morphing, it was a big-deal special effect in a 1988
film called _Willow_.  A spell was cast, and a small object transformed into
several animals--ostrich and lion among them--before settling into a human form.
These days, you can see morphing on the opening credits for the TV sitcom
_Roseanne_... still pictures of the principal actors from various seasons morph
to show you how far they--or their cosmetic surgeons--have come.

     In 1995, at the same time _Roseanne_ proved that morphing was within the
budget of a television program, Mike Westerfield proved that it was possible on
the Apple IIgs with Quick Click Morph.

     I was pleasantly surprised at how simple it was to create a morph with QCM.
I had been thinking of the process as complicated, and it really isn't at all.
You load two pictures you want to morph between, then click a few times to
establish boundaries for the morphing.  QCM steps in and creates all the
in-between frames.

MORPHING 101   The thing to keep in mind is that morphing is just an
""""""""""""   animation technique.  QCM allows you to focus on this one
technique.  It's as if QCM is one feature of an animation package, so naturally
it's simple to understand and use.

     Practically the only concepts you have to learn are those of key frames,
tween frames, and morph control point.  Key frames are the pictures you load
into QCM (IIgs format or TIFF, which is very popular on Mac and Windows
platforms).  Tween frames are the pictures between the key frames.  Morphing
involves two simultaneous techniques--fading and stretching.  Morph control
points look after the stretching.

     If you've seen any ads or demos for Quick Click Morph, you've probably seen
the little girl morphed into a cat.  To achieve this effect, it's important to
have the cat's pointy ears grow out of the girl's head.  You want to stretch a
gentle curve into a triangular shape, so you create three control points at the
angles of the triangle.

     All the complicated work is done by the computer.  It compares each picture
using an algorithm too complicated for my brain, and works out how much to fade
and stretch a picture.

     Morphs over space have gotten all the noise--a girl transforms into a cat.
Much more impressive to my eyes are morphs over time--like the ones at the start
of _Roseanne_.  The evolution morph included with QCM also demonstrates this
well.  Let me use a combination space/time morph to explain how Quick Click
Morph works and how well it does its job.

BEGIN METAMORPHOSIS   Let's start with images of three generations--my
"""""""""""""""""""   father, myself, and my son.  (I don't actually have any
children, except for the purposes of this review.)  The first key frame loaded
is my father, the second is me, and the third is my son.  We're going to be
looking at family resemblance.

     The first thing to do is create some control points on the picture of my
father.  Control points for each of the eyes make a good start, then add more
control points for the nose, mouth, and ears.  That's enough to begin.  As we
move the cursor to each of these places and click the mouse button, QCM draws a
small cross to indicate the control point.  When you click to create a point,
the cross is red.  When you click to create a second point, the first cross
turns green--the active point is always red.

     (I really wish Westerfield hadn't chosen red and green.  I'm red-green
color-blind, and that's a fairly common form of color-blindness.  I can tell the
difference when the crosses are on light backgrounds, but on dark backgrounds,
there's a lot of squinting and even more wild guessing.)

     After you've clicked to create the control points on the picture of my
father, flip to the next key frame and look at the picture of me.  The control
points are drawn on this frame too, but not exactly in the right positions.  My
father's face is a little broader than mine, so the control point for the left
eye is fine, but the control point for the right is on my right temple.  At this
point, you should drag any errant control points so that they correspond to the
correct positions.

     The morph will work a lot better if all the key frames are about the same
size.  There's almost no point is using a picture of my father that takes up the
entire screen if my picture barely takes up a quarter of the screen.  The
transition wouldn't be smooth at all.  The same objection applies to positioning
of pictures, even if they are the same size.  If my father's head is near the
top of the frame, and my head is the near the bottom, that transition won't be
smooth either.

     Fortunately, Quick Click Morph allows you to resize and reposition your key
frames.  The manual advises you that it's better to use a full-featured paint
program to do this, but the program gives you the capability anyway.

     (One thing that a full-featured paint program does that QCM doesn't is
allow you to eliminate background clutter.  My picture of my father has a
background of shelves of books, and my picture of me has a medium-gray
background.  I eliminated both backgrounds with Platinum Paint.  It wasn't
easy--it made me appreciate just how talented airbrush artists really are.  Tip:
Once I had turned both backgrounds pure white, I used a round paintbrush and the
smooth mode to make my ragged airbrush technique look a lot less distracting.)

     Let's get back to our morph:  we've created the control points on the
picture of my father, and dragged the same points into the correct positions on
my picture.  The next thing to do is drag the same points into corresponding
position on the picture of my son, right?  Not quite.

     Each transition in a morph sequence must be handled separately.  When you
view the finished movie, it'll look like father morphing into son and then into
grandson--beginning, middle, and ending--but it's really two sequences, father
(begin) into son (end) and son (begin) into grandson (end).

     That means you have to place all the control points of my picture all over
again.  Unfortunately, there's no shortcut for this.  You can't select all the
control points from the end of the first transition, copy them, and paste them
onto the start of the second transition.  It is very important to think of each
morphing sequence as its own transition, but it's a pity points can't be copied
from one sequence to another.

     The concept of separate sequences is important.  Just because father into
son used 9 tween frames is no reason that son into grandson has to use the same
number.  The second transition could take 5 frames, or 13.  Also, if my father
and I resemble each other a lot, then perhaps 6 control points are all that are
needed.  If my son and I don't resemble each other as much, then 18 control
points might be necessary to create a really smooth transition.

     Another aspect of each transition is the speed of each fade.  There are
three speeds--slow, normal, and fast--and both the outgoing image and the
incoming image have a speed assigned.  For photographs, the manual recommends
"slow in, slow out".  For line drawings (like most comic strips and cartoons),
"fast in, fast out" is recommended.

MEASURING UP   How well does Quick Click Morph perform?  Here's how to sum
""""""""""""   it up:  it's fun, easy... and slow.  To be fair, none of the
parts that involve the user are slow.  But the part that involves letting the
computer work out its algorithm is very slow.  Even with a ZipGS or TransWarp GS
accelerator installed.  We're talking hours.

     The main factors that influence how long a morph takes are the size of the
frame, the number of control points, and how many colors are used.  QCM allows
for a creditable number of colors to be displayed--you're not limited to the 16
normally available in 320-mode or the 4 available in 640-mode.  If you're using
a TIFF graphic, you can have up to 256 colors (although you'd be unwise to go to
that extreme).

     The number of control points greatly influences the speed of a morph, so
it's a pity that there's is no way to tell how many points are used in a
transition.  Except by counting them on the screen.  In a transition that uses
many control points, they may be so close together that counting them isn't
possible.

     When Westerfield wrote QCM, he seemed to be aware of the fact that
producing finished morphs takes a long time.  He allowed the user to interrupt
the morphs and save them for another time.  Saved morphs keep track of which
frames have been morphed, so that they don't have to be re-morphed when the file
is loaded again.  As a morph takes place, each is frame is displayed on the
screen to give you an idea of what the metamorphosis looks like so far.

     The manual also recommends a technique to help save you time.  Suppose you
have the key frame of my father, then 3 tween frames, and the key frame of me.
If you move to the second tween frame, which is the exact middle of the
sequence, and morph just that one frame, you'll get a rough idea of how smooth
the transition will be.  This is obviously much faster than morphing all the
tween frames and then viewing the entire transition.

     You have to figure out for yourself which the middle tween frame is, and
then you have to count carefully as you advance the frames one by one.  The only
way to find out which frame you're in is rather clumsy--choose Save Frame As...
from the Frame menu, and notice the default filename that QCM has assigned it.
Then click the Cancel button, since you probably don't really want to save the
frame.  As I said, this is clumsy.

     Even morphing that single middle frame is not quick--most frames I morphed
were from 4 to 6 minutes.  If you have a lot of tween frames--and frankly, 9
tween frames is not a lot--then you can quickly see how each sequence can take
time to morph.  And that's just for the transition from father to son.  There's
still the son-grandson transition to morph.

SPECIFICS   I hope this talk of how slow Quick Click Morph can be isn't
"""""""""   putting you off, because we're about to descend to specifics:

     The Apple IIgs graphic screen is 320 pixels by 200 pixels, or 640x200,
depending on which mode you're in.  Quite a lot of graphics are in 320 mode, so
we'll look at that mode.  Frankly, you'd have to be crazy to morph the entire
320x200 area.  It could take a long time.  So for our test, I've chosen an area
of 140x145 pixels.  All of our images--my father, myself, and my son--are
grayscale (B&W) pictures, using a paltry 16 "colors" (grays) each.

     Let's create 38 control points for each of the two transitions.  (That
might sound like a lot, but it's not.)  Let's have 9 tween frames for each
transition, and create just the midpoint tween frame.  In my example, with a 8
mHz ZipGS, it took just under 6 minutes to morph each frame, or 12 minutes for
midpoint frames for both transitions.

     At this point--with just 3 key frames and 2 tween frames, let's save the
morph file to see how big it is:  189K.  Slightly less than a quarter of the
capacity of a 3.5" disk (800K).  We'll come back to this later.

     Neither of the transitions looks exactly right, so we'll add 8 more control
points to each, making a total of 46 for each sequence.  Since we've added
control points, we have to morph the midpoint frame all over again.  Those 8
control points have added a full minute to the morph--it took just over 7
minutes this time.

     But it was worth it!  The morphs look much smoother now.  We can now tell
QCM to morph all the frames in all the sequences, and it will work away happily
without any further input from us.  We can walk away and leave the IIgs running.

     (One slightly quirky note:  when creating a morph with 4 key frames, I was
obliged to stop the morph during the third and final sequence.  When I resumed,
the display read "Sequence 1 of 3"--or possibly "Sequence 1 of 1"--instead of
"Sequence 3 of 3".  That worried me--I was afraid QCM had forgotten that
sequences 1 and 2 were complete, and that 2 hours of work was being done over
again.  I shouldn't have worried.  Despite the display, QCM was working on the
third and final sequence.  Phew.)

     Walking away from the IIgs is really a good idea, because it has 16 frames
to morph at over 7 minutes a frame.  (Yes, 16 frames.  No, not 18.  We've
already morphed the midpoint frame, and QCM won't make us do it over again.)
It's going to take roughly 2 hours to complete the entire morph--and it would
have been 2 and 1/4 hours if we hadn't done the midpoint frames first.

     When I was writing this review, I was able to cheat on a grand scale:  my
wife had gone off to class, leaving her similarly-accelerated free for hours.  I
just set the morph going and continued writing on my own computer.  But
supposing I hadn't been able to cheat?  Two hours is a long time to wait to get
your computer back.

     With all the morphing done, let's save the 3 key frames and 18 tween frames
to disk.  The morph file has almost doubled in size--it's 360K now.

     Even now, we're not done.  We've just created the morph.  Now we have to
turn the morph into a movie--an animation that anyone can see, even if they
don't own Quick Click Morph.  It is possible to view this animation without
leaving QCM--if it's short and/or if you have a lot of memory.  If you run out
of memory--as I did when trying to view my 3-key-frame morph--you can save the
movie to disk.  (The movie is even larger than the morph--486K; over half the
capacity of a 3.5" disk.)

     I'm delighted to report that turning a morph into a movie takes no
appreciable time at all.  If you've saved your movie to disk, you do have to
quit out of QCM and run an animation player--or use an NDA animation player like
ShowMe.  There's a player included with QCM.  It's a nuisance to have to quit,
but animation has always been a memory-intensive process--this is hardly the
fault of QCM.

     Creating a morph is a process that demands a long time and a fair amount of
disk space.  I feel I should emphasize that QCM is not slow when accepting input
from you, the user.  When you're defining your morph, QCM is quick and easy.
When it's time to create the morph, it's very slow.

     Quick Click Morph makes it easy to create morphs--but that's not the same
as saying it's easy to create good morphs.  You could create a morph that just
uses 6 control points, but it's probably not going to be very smooth.  Even if
you use a lot of control points, QCM has some limitations.  Don't look for
Hollywood-quality morphs.  Sometimes the stretching effect takes a back seat to
the fading effect.  For example, in the well-known girl-into-cat morph, the
cat's ears are supposed to grow out of the girl's head.  That does happen, but
not subtly enough for my taste.  As early as the first tween frame--the frame
immediately following the key frame of the girl in her natural state--the ears
have started to fade in at approximately their natural height (though a quarter
of their natural size).

GOODIES   One feature that makes Quick Click Morph particularly useful is
"""""""   the ability to save a morphed frame.  This feature has three
immediately obvious uses.

     First, let's say you've been working on a key frame, and have 50 control
points placed.  You suddenly decide you should have removed all the background
detail--but you don't want to have start over and place all those points again.
Just save the frame, import it into a paint program, and manipulate it.  As long
as you don't change the frame's size or position--very hard to do
accidentally!--you load the altered picture back into QCM by using the Update
Frame command.

     Second, you may find that a morphed frame makes a great key frame for
another part of the same morph--or for another morph altogether!  With QCM's
save frame feature, you can save a tween frame for later use.

     Finally, you may want to use a morphed frame as a still picture somewhere.
I took three pictures of myself from three different years, 1988, 1990, and
1994.  My face changed a little in that time, but not a lot.  The odd thing is
that none of the three pictures is a particularly good likeness of me... but the
midpoint frame from the 1990-1994 transition is!  If I want a picture of myself
that really looks like me, I can use the "fake" picture from "1992".  I probably
won't.  But I _could_; that's the point.  (Incidentally, Genie users can
download a copy of the 6-year morph from the A2 libraries.)

     A feature that Quick Click Morph shares with its older sister, Quick Click
Calc, is file encryption.  If you want to keep prying eyes away from your morph
in progress, you can enter a password as you save it.  When you load the morph,
you'll be asked for the password before you are allowed to continue work on it.

MANUAL   I like the Byte Works manuals, even though certain typographical
""""""   errors--such as "loose" for "lose"--drive the editor in me absolutely
bonkers.  This tiny flaw aside, the manual does a good job of explaining
concepts.  The tutorial section is a breeze to follow.

     Remember how I said that the programmer/program was aware of how long
morphing frames takes?  The manual seems to be slightly less aware.  It
encourages experimenting with the number of colors (16, 128, 256) and with the
Fade (Slow/Normal/Fast, In/Out).  The slowness of the program discourages
morphing.  A lot.  If you are going to experiment, do it early on with small
frames, few colors, and few control points.

MOVIE PLAYER   The Quick Click Movie Player has features I've seen in other
""""""""""""   animation players--slow down, speed up, stop, advance a frame at
a time--but it can also create movie "scripts".  This makes a great way to join
separate animations into a longer show.

     The manual says that if you want an animation to play twice, just add it to
the script twice in succession.  That sounds like a good idea, but unfortunately
the animation has be loaded each time, even though it's the same animation.  If
you're loading animations from anything but a superfast hard drive or RAM drive,
the slowdown will annoy you.  If there's ever an update, perhaps Westerfield
will allow QCMP to check for replays of a movie already in memory.

SUMMARY   Quick Click Morph is fun, simple to use, and slow.  The slowness
"""""""   discourages making changes and experimenting, but it's in the nature
of the beast.  No matter what computer hardware or software is used, animation
is memory-hungry, disk-hungry, and time-ravenous.

     This isn't an "everyday" program--it's like a single feature of a larger
animation program.  Even movies that use morphing don't use the technique every
five minutes.  You'll probably want to use it sparingly too.

     Because you'll be using it sparingly, you might find that the slowness
isn't too big a price to pay--after all, you won't be using Quick Click Morph
every day.  Consider this as well:  if you need the morphing technique in your
animations, you need this program.  Quick Click Morph is the only game in town.

                      ~ GenieLamp A2 Profile:  Bret Victor

     A few dedicated software programmers remain in the Apple II world.  Their
work contributes immensely to the continued enjoyment those in the Apple II
community get from using their computers.  One of those programmers in Bret
Victor, whose recent work for Softdisk Publishing Inc. has revitalized the
_Softdisk G-S_ monthly on-disk publication.

     Victor has been using Apple II computers since the second grade.  His
parents bought him the first and only computer he's ever owned, an Apple IIgs,
when he was still in elementary school.  Through the years he learned to program
the computer and is now the principal contributor to _Softdisk G-S_.

     Victor took some time during his recent winter break from college to tell
_Juiced.GS_ and the Apple II community a little more about himself. ...


Bret>  Well, I grew up in a town called Castro Valley, in the East Bay in
""""   California. I guess I did a lot of stuff in high school:  I became an
Eagle Scout, I was a member of a computer users group and did volunteer computer
tutoring, I played soccer and ran track, I did some programming, I played the
piano, I got a four-point something GPA.  A lot of that stuff ended up not
mattering very much.

     Track was important, but a couple of hamstring pulls my senior year left me
unable to compete, which was too bad since I was expected to go to the state
meet that year.  Piano became important once I dumped the classical music and
started playing tunes out of fakebooks and improvising.

     Now I'm a sophomore at Cal Tech, where I occassionally attend classes and
try not to work if I can help it.  I think Caltech is a great place, but it
costs way too much.  I'm majoring in electrical engineering, which I whimsically
decided after taking an EE class and finding it fun.  Music is still a very
important part of my life, and track probably will be too once I recover enough
to seriously compete again.

Juiced.GS>  What got you interested programming for the IIGS?  What was
"""""""""   some of your early work on the Apple II?

Bret>  Well, I'd always been interested in programming.  I'd write cool
""""   little things in Applesoft on my IIgs, since I never had the attention
span for any kind of major project.  Major projects ended up being set aside for
other smaller projects, and then abandoned as the smaller projects themselves
were set aside for other projects.

     I have quite a few unfinished programs.  Most of them, looking back at them
now, are just as well unfinished, but at the time I was just a kid, and I was
doing exciting stuff.  The exception to all this was TextFighter, which started
out as doodling in a screen editor while I was coming up with screens for some
other program I was writing.  I drew little text stick figures, and said, hey, I
wonder if I can get these guys to move around?  Once they were moving, that
naturally led to, hey, I wonder if I can get these guys to hit each other?
Promising myself that I would return soon to my previous project, I began to
write a game that would end up going through several rewrites and taking almost
two years to complete.  Of course, I was only working during summer and winter
breaks, and the occasional weekend.

     TextFighter is still one of the programs that I am the most proud of.  I
sent it Softdisk, they sent me $700, and it ended up co-starring on issue #171
with some card game.  Rather anticlimatic.  Maybe it was a learning experience,
whatever that means.

     Up to this time, I had never learned IIgs-specific programming because I
figured it would be a waste, since I didn't think I would be staying with the
IIgs too much longer.  But that changed after I had written a cool patch to
ProSel-8 that made it display a random tagline on the screen.  I liked it, but
most people don't boot into Prosel-8 like I do, so I wondered if I could make a
tagline appear on the GS/OS splash screen.

     I had never seen a line of 16-bit assembly in my life, but that didn't stop
me from dissassembling the START.GSOS file and seeing if I could find a place to
patch.  (I remember that it took me a little while to figure out that I needed
to put the Monitor in 16-bit mode.) In a couple days, I had written my patch.  I
had mostly used the Monitor and mini-assembler, and really had no idea what I
was doing, but it worked.  Then, I decided to put the part that would choose a
tagline into an INIT file. So I pulled the source code to the "NO IBM" init off
of A2Pro, saw how an init worked, and soon I had a preliminary version of
Opening Line.  Later, I saw that I could have it show a background picture file
too (using the low-level loader that was for loading GSOS in the first place).

     Of course, all this time I had no reference manuals whatsoever, and
everything I knew about IIgs assembly I had learned from hacking system
software.

     So, I knew IIgs assembly and I knew how to make an INIT file.  That was
enough to let me do all kinds of cool things that I had always wanted to do but
that I didn't because I thought that there would be effort involved in learning
16-bit programming.  So near the end of that summer, I wrote lots of little
INITs doing lots of cool, useless things.  This was my uselessware series.  I
wrote them to ward off boredom and depression, and to hopefully make other
people laugh or enjoy their computer more.

     After I got back to school, I wrote PuyoPuyo and some stuff for _Softdisk
G-S_.  Then during the summer, I wrote Operation Lambda and more stuff for
_Softdisk G-S_.  My total program count now is somewhere near twenty-five.  And
I still feel like I don't really know what I'm doing.

Juiced.GS>  You've also done extensive work as a graphic artist for
"""""""""   various IIgs multimedia publications.  How did all that came about?

Bret>  As for artwork, the whole Power-GS art thing came as a surprise,
""""   since I never (and still don't) consider myself to have any artistic
talent.  PongLife (the precursor to Power-GS) had just come out, and fooling
around in Platinum Paint for some reason one day, I came up with some
cool-looking PongLife logos, and sent them to the editors.  They liked them (or
more likely, were simply desperate for artwork), and asked me to make more stuff
for them.  So I fooled around some more in Platinum.  After a while, I had
gotten pretty good at fooling around, and was able to make cool screens and
logos.  Which is what I did for Power-GS issues two through six, for the Opening
Line picture packs, and for LiveWire IIgs.  So I'm not bad at graphic design
(whatever that is), but my artistic skills are still along the lines of the
TextFighter stick figures.

Juiced.GS>  Your musical background is evident in your work. What all have
"""""""""   you done musically on the IIGS?

Bret>  Well, the first song in Operation Lambda was the first real song I
""""   ever wrote on the IIgs.  The second Lambda song was my second attempt at
computer music, and so on.  After the five Lambda songs, I also wrote music for
SurfBurgers and CrossHatch, which are two of my _Softdisk G-S_ games.  The
hardest part was finding instruments.  The songs themselves didn't take very
long to write -- I just sat down at SoundSmith and started typing stuff in.  The
object was just to make something for the game player to bounce along to while
trying to figure out the game, and I think I achieved that pretty well.

Juiced.GS>  How do you go about composing music on your computer and what
"""""""""   hardware/software do you use?

Bret>  I write the songs in Soundsmith, typing all the notes in by hand
""""   because there really isn't any other way to do it.  Well, I use the copy
and paste options a lot too, which is pretty evident if you listen to the music.
I don't have or use MIDI.

Juiced.GS>  Operation Lambda's sudden appearance seemed to catch the
"""""""""   IIgs community by surprise. Please trace for us the development
process, from inception through implementation to the announcement that the
program was for sale?

Bret>  Well, if that's the case, then I certainly hope the IIgs community
""""   recovers from their surprise long enough to send me some money.  Anyway,
I knew I wanted to write a IIgs game over the summer, and I knew I wanted it to
be a logic/thinking game with lots of levels.  Other than that, I was clueless.
I started experimenting with ideas similar to "Brix" on the PC, changing and
adding things until I eventually came up with various game elements -- lasers,
mirrors, hostages, a little guy that walks around.  The final project happily
ended up not resembling Brix whatsoever.  Once I had my game idea planned out, I
simply sat down and programmed it.  And drew the art and designed the levels and
wrote the music and wrote the docs and sent it out to beta testers who liked it
for the most part.  Then I uploaded the demo, announced it was for sale, sat
back, and prepared to be inundated with a veritable landslide of orders and
letters from my hordes of adoring fans.  I'm still waiting on that last step.

Juiced.GS>  You didn't think you were going to get through this without me
"""""""""   asking about your on-line screen name, did you?  Tell us how the
name "Slixter" came about. And while you're at it, what exactly is "Right
Triangle Productions"?

Bret>  In seventh grade I think, I got into an insulting match with
""""   someone, and the worst he could call me was "slixter", deriding me for
having gone heavy on the hair spray that morning.  I thought that was a pretty
cool name, and since I was getting into BBS's at the time, I used it as my
handle.  I always thought it would be awesome if people actually _knew_ me by
that handle, and that dream actually came true after uselessware and Power-GS.
I forget how Right Triangle Productions came about, but I used it on
TextFighter, and every game I've written since then.

Juiced.GS>  You have been around in the Genie A2 Roundtable for as long as
"""""""""   I've been associated with the on-line service. When did you first
join Genie's A2 areas, and how close contact do you keep with the RT now? Do you
plan on migrating to Delphi any time soon?

Bret>  I joined Genie a long time ago, starting out with raiding the file
""""   base and eventually using CoPilot to peruse messages.  Through my
Power-GS connections I got the job as IIgs art editor for multimedia LiveWire
IIgs, which provided me with enough Genie credit so that I was effectively using
Genie for free, and still am.  However, it's about to run out, so I'll probably
be "migrating" to Delphi soon.  I was pretty active in A2 during the summer, but
I just don't have the time for CoPilot during the school year.

Juiced.GS>  You call some of your programs uselessware, but your
"""""""""   _Softdisk G-S_ programs are anything but. I installed PickQuick! on
my system and use it quite a bit. I have also found myself using World Times
Zones, especially when I'm on-line reading messages from folks in other parts of
the world. These are cool as well as useful. The "Mighty" series of desk
accessories also come to mind. Any more of these types of programs up your
sleeve?

Bret>  No uselessware ever appeared on Softdisk.  Uselessware was the
""""   name for a series of freeware INITs I uploaded to Genie in the late
summer of '95.  It included ShadyBar, Bender, Boinger, GravityMouse, Horoscope,
and SlixLaunch.  As for my future SDGS releases, I have no idea what I'll come
up with next.  I never do.  I sure hope I think of something.

Juiced.GS>  Has SDGS already published all of your contributions, or are
"""""""""   there still some yet to come? Do you plan to continue developing
software for SDGS?

Bret>  Oh, there's plenty more that I've written that they have yet to
""""   publish.  Two more issues worth of stuff, at least.  I plan on continuing
developing software for SDGS as long as I'm too lazy to find something else to
do that pays more.  So that'll probably be quite a while.  I'm even working on a
new game right now.

Juiced.GS>  Does it seem to you that the IIGS market is shrinking to the
"""""""""   point where programmers and developers can no longer afford to
undertake IIGS projects?

Bret>  No, programmers can still -afford- to undertake IIgs projects;
""""   they just can't expect them to be significantly profitable.  I think it's
been that way for quite a while.  The IIgs has turned back into a hobbyist's
machine, and the only reason to keep programming on it is because you enjoy it,
or you like the IIgs community, or you're too stubborn to make the effort to
branch out. There's still money to be made off of IIgs programs, but it's pocket
change compared to what a good Windows 95 application or Java applet could bring
in. I guess some of us just don't mind that.

Juiced.GS>  It's obvious you have a wide range of talents and interests,
"""""""""   and you seem to get many of them working together when you program
the IIGS. Do you ever see yourself specializing in one of those areas (music,
design, programming, etc.), or perhaps using one or more of them to launch a
professional career in the computing industry?

Bret>  I'd like to become a rock star, but then again, who wouldn't?  I
""""   think my college major is somewhere in the hardware design area, but I
still have no idea what I'll be doing in the "real world".
