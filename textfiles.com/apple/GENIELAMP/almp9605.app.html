                             >>> WEE PAWS <<<
                             """"""""""""""""

     My wife and I recently took the day off to visit the Ontario Science 
Centre in North York (part of metropolitan Toronto--Toronto is the 
provincial capital).  The Centre is a science museum for anyone who is even 
mildly interested in science but bored by science museums.  Translation:  
Good luck dragging your kids out of there before the Centre closes.

     My wife and I arrived half an hour after the Centre opened at 10 AM 
and left only when forced to, at 6 PM.  Even then, we didn't get to see 
everything--there was no time to play in the Internet Cafe, for instance, 
though that may have been because we tried the rock-climbing exhibit twice.  
I can't imagine how we would have managed if we'd taken any kids (other 
than ourselves, that is).

     I'd better confess here and now that I didn't see any Apple II 
computers anywhere.  Plenty of basic, classic Macintoshes--a disturbing 
number of which had crashed--but not a single Apple II.  I suspect that if 
Apple Canada still supported the Apple II, the Ontario Science Centre would 
use 'em.

     Those who run the Ontario Science Centre seems to understand that 
while playing with computers is fun, computers can also be used to make 
other sorts of play more fun.  They seem to know that the fun can be 
spoiled if the computer is allowed to run things, not the visitor.

     "Land Like a Cat", an exhibit in the Sport hall, relegates the 
computer to its proper place.  You walk up a set of steps, at the top of 
which is an embedded scale.  A color monitor tells you when to jump, and 
you leap from the steps to the ground, where there's a hidden platform that 
measures the force of impact.  The color monitor draws a picture of a cat 
landing, plays a sound effect, and tells you "You landed with a force [x] 
times your own weight."

     Anyone with children will tell you what kids will do in a situation 
like this:  land with as much force as possible.  And why not?  The 
explosion sound effect for landing heavily is much more satisfying than the 
applause sound effect for landing lightly.  In a culture where bigger is 
better, "24 times" looks more impressive than "2 times".  The exhibit was 
built for wear and tear.  It's clearly meant for the younger set.  So once 
again:  why not?

     Darned if I know.  But I have to tell you I was a little bemused all 
the same.  Because the exhibit was designed so that even some adults 
couldn't tell what the point was.  After two young boys had taken several 
turns, my wife and I joined the queue.  (If you blush just because you're 
twice as tall as the next tallest person in line, you might want to avoid 
the Ontario Science Centre.)

     Being a hopeless old stodge at the age of thirty-something, I did not 
try to crush the scales into multiple fragments by landing with the 
righteous fury of a Juvenal.  I tried to land lightly, and did so well 
enough to garner applause.  Only then did the father of the two boys 
realize that this was the point, at least in the mind of the designer.

     Should kids care what the designer's point was?  Almost certainly 
not.  I could argue that they should be able to figure out what the 
objective is, even if they decide to ignore it.  I'm not going to.  I am 
going to argue that their parents should be able to understand the exhibit.  
What a parent does with that knowledge is his or her own business.

     I hope I'm not being overly conformist to be just a shade bemused 
when an exhibit has a poor design.  You don't want to damage a child's 
self-esteem by constantly yelling "YOU GOT IT WRONG!", but shouldn't it be 
possible for a child who wants feedback to learn how it did?  I don't know.  
Possibly fostering a child's need for assurances makes him or her less 
independent.  We don't want to overdo approval/disapproval, but we don't 
want to skimp on guidance, either.  These are complex issues.

     Software design is a complex issue, too.  I don't want to pick on 
this one exhibit--this isn't the first time I've come across software where 
setbacks were more impressively programmed than achievements.  I can't say 
I have a solution to this issue of esteem vs. feedback.  I just hope like 
heck there's still time to raise a few questions.

ADDENDUM AND CORRIGENDUM   Last issue, Andrew Roughan wrote in to question 
""""""""""""""""""""""""   the pedigree of John MacLean's DOS 3.3 Launcher 
v2.1.  (Note that v2.0 was not called into question; it's perfectly fine.)  
Roughan hoped that the A2 RoundTable would change the description; in fact, 
v2.1 has been removed from circulation.  Remember that v2.0 is still 
available, and that v2.2 is expected soon.

     In the January issue, we claimed that "LoadPall helps extend the 
native abilities of HyperCard IIGS by allowing the display of 16, 256, and 
3200 color 320-mode graphics in HyperCard".  LoadPall author Brian 
Gillespie points out that 3200-color graphics are not supported.

HYPERSTUDIO ANOMALY   I've found an interesting difference between the full
"""""""""""""""""""   authoring version of HyperStudio, which lets you 
write your own stacks, and the run-time version, which allows you to run 
stacks created by other.  To see it, you'll need to visit the Hog Heaven 
page.

     If you are using the full HyperStudio package to view this edition of 
GenieLamp A2, the Contents button in the bottom left corner of the screen 
will be labelled with white text on a black background.  If you are using 
the run-time version, you will see the reverse--black text on a white 
background.  This is possibly related to displaying an icon button, with 
text, over a 320-mode graphic.

     Has anyone out there noticed other differences between HyperStudio 
and the run-time version?

GRAPHICWRITER III PROGRAMMER RESPONDS   Thank you for the GraphicWriter III 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   2.0 review in the April 1996 
GenieLamp A2.

     I'd like to briefly explain the 2.0 designation, which fortunately 
enough seems to be the only negative issue in your review :-), and also 
correct one potential misnomer.

     We've been working on and off this update for almost three years, and 
right up until January 1996 it was considered version 1.2.  Nearing 
completion, feedback from our beta testers, and our own "look back" at the 
list of new features suggested that perhaps this should be version 2.0, a 
starting point for future revisions.  After a couple of weeks deliberation 
and agreement with our beta testers, we decided to go with that 
designation.

     The potential misnomer is at the beginning of your review, and 
suggests that, and I quote, "Australian programmer Richard Bennett is the 
man behind this update."  Yes, I am the programmer, and yes I am 
Australian, however I am not the man "behind" this update.

     The man behind most of Seven Hills' products, at least for the six 
years I've been working with them, is Dave Hecker, and he rarely receives 
the credit he deserves.  While the coding technicalities of updating 
GrahicWriter III were quite significant, considering the state it was in 
after leaving DataPak, the design and layout (no pun intended) of the 
update as well as most of the new features and bug reports were all Dave's.

     I realise my opinion may be seen as biased, but companies such as 
Seven Hills deserve our support.  While most companies have either gone 
under or moved on to bluer pastures, others such as Seven Hills, ByteWorks 
and Parkhurst Microproducts (to name a few) are still writing software for 
the computer we all love, the Apple II, and making very little out of it.

     Apple II forever!

Best regards,
Richard Bennett
[RICHARD.B]

          In the sense that GraphicWriter III v2.0 is a _point d'appui_ 
          for future versions, you have a valid point.  This seems to me a 
          programmer's distinction rather than a user's distinction, 
          though, so users do need to be aware of the small functional 
          changes between v1.3 and v2.0.  Perhaps I'd better emphasize once 
          more that this question of a version number is quite a minor one.

          As to the second matter, it seems my words were poorly chosen.  
          Because I knew Dave Hecker was the guiding force "behind" the 
          update, I didn't seen any harm in using the phrase that you were 
          behind it--I meant merely to convey that you wrote the update.  
          Other who don't know of Dave's work may have been misled.  Thanks 
          for writing to clear that up and to sing a brief verse (no 
          chorus) for a formerly unsung hero of the Apple II.--DGC


LAMP A2 ON COMP.SYS.APPLE2   Any chance of getting this month's GenieLamp 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   posted to, say, csa2?
Tom
[TDON@delphi.com]

          If by this you mean you'd like my forecasting of the 
          probability, I would answer that the chances are excellent.  
          Matthew Pearce has been posting GenieLamp A2 (I assume you mean 
          the A2 edition; aside from the A2Pro edition, there are at least 
          three others for other computer platforms) to the comp.sys.apple2 
          newsgroup, unasked, for many months now.  I'm sure he'll get 
          around to it eventually; he usually does.  I don't know who the 
          heck he is or why he has volunteered for this, but I bless him 
          for it.

          If by this you mean to ask if I will be posting it, the answer 
          is no.  I do not have an Internet account, only a Genie account.  
          Genie does allow for some Internet access, but it is possible to 
          post only though Lynx.  Try using Lynx to post a document as 
          short as 100 lines to a newsgroup, and you'll understand why I 
          cannot myself post GenieLamp A2.

          I keep hoping that sometime soon it will be possible for me to 
          ensure that GenieLamp A2 gets better distribution outside of 
          Genie.  I'm well aware that a lot of Internet denizens read Lamp 
          A2 too.  As editor, technically my job might be over once the 
          issue "goes to press", but these days, I have to take on a lot 
          more of the publisher's duties, which includes making sure people 
          who want our magazine can read it.--DGC

""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   of Juiced.GS to the printer in late 
February, I ordered 50 copies over and above the number of subscriptions 
sold at that point.

     Well, only two (2) copies of the newsletter remain on my desk, and 
one of them is MINE!  I mailed the 151st, 152nd and 153rd copy today 
(Monday).  And to think that I was worried that I might end up eating the 
overrun. :)

     I placed an order for another batch of copies last week, and will 
pick them up on Tuesday.  There will be no "sold out" sign hanging anywhere 
around here.

SUBSCRIBERS RALLY 'ROUND, PART II   Whew; what a relief!
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
     When Shareware Solutions II hit that magic number of 1,000 
subscribers, my printer started giving me a 10% volume discount on printing 
costs.

     Now that all of the original charter subscriptions have expired, I've 
been concerned recently that I was going to lose that discount.

     However, it looks like the postcard renewal project worked, and the

CHANGING THE APPLEWORKS GS DEFAULT FONT   The following was posted by 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   A2.MARTIN in November 1992:

     (This is a quote from a older issue of my users group NewsLetter, and 
I quote it as it is.  I have no idea if it will REALLY work and I never 
tried it.  Please use this patch only on a backup disk, NEVER on your 
original disk.  You'll need a copy of the original v1.1 AppleWorks GS 
program disk and a disk editor, like Block Warden from Glen Bredon).

     1) Page Layout module:

     Look for block $49B, byte $9C (version 1.0v2: block $24F, byte $EC). 
You should find the following sequence there:

     A9 03 00       LDA #3         (family #)
     8D 73 1B       STA            store family
     A9 00 00       LDA #0         (style word)
     8D 75 1B       STA            store style
     A9 0C 00       LDA #$C        (size word)
     8D 77 1B       STA            store size
     A9 19 99       LDA #$10       justification
     8D 71 1B       STA            store justification
     A9 01 00       LDA #1         (spacing)
     8D 6F 1B       STA            store spacing

     2) Word processor:

     This patch is divided into two steps: a) block $609, by $93 (version 
1.0v2: block $4EE, byte $02)

     A9 03 00       LDA #3         (family #)
     87 0B          STA [$B]
     A9 00 0C       LDA #$0C00     (size(high) and style(low) )
     A0 02 00       LDY #2
     97 0B          STA [$B],Y

     b) and again on block $64F, byte 141 (version 1.0v2: block $533, byte 
$18)

     A9 03 00 87 08 A9 00 0C A0 02 00 97 07

     So what do you have to patch in here? These are the descriptions 
(we're looking at 1) for reference):

     - font family number ($03=Geneva, $14 would be Times)
     - style (0=plain, 1=bold, 2=italic, 4=underline, 8=outline, 
       $10=shadow, $40=superscript, $80=subscript)
     - size ($0C=12 point)
     - justification ($10=left, $20=center, $40=right, $80=full)
     - spacing (1=single, 2=double, 4=quadruple (right word??? :-)  )

end of original post
---------------------------------------------------------------

     I've used it to change the WP default to Shaston 8.  For v1.1, I 
found the above string of bytes to look like this:

     A9 03 00 87 0B A9 00 0C A0 02 00 97 0B

and I changed it to this:

     A9 FE FF 87 0B A9 00 08 A0 02 00 97 0B
        |__|___________|__|__________________Family (Shaston = $FFFE)
                       |__|__________________Style
                          |__________________Size (8)

     This may be more than a little cryptic to a lot of folks.  If anyone 
problems finding what and where to patch, give me shout and I'll try to 
explain in more detail.

MORE APPLECOLOR MONITOR REPAIR TIPS   I thought that this info might help 
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   you or any other techies in the 
future when you have an AppleColor RGB monitor to repair.  Since there is 
no service manual available and it took me a year of on and off work to 
clear up two troubles in this spare monitor which looks good now. Here are 
3 mini-lytic numbers to look for:

     No Raster- C407 3.3 @ 350 Hot and plastic cover had shrunk making it 
obvious.

     Vertical weave in video slowly moving up the screen.  Looked like the 
old fashion ac troubles but after I was told that the ps was a 25khz job I 
moved into the horizontal.  By moving the raster off to the left I found a 
nice straight edge on the right side of the raster.

     Found C532 470 @ 16 near front of board with a pf of 50.
     Found C519 22 @ 25 small cap near front IC with no capacity.

     Finally finished and now have a spare monitor for my TN summer house. 
Won't have to drag a monitor back and forth every six months.  Wish I could 
afford a laptop.  (Grin).

IIGS SURVERY   The following is a survey that I am conducting concerning GS 
""""""""""""   owners/users.  Please send the corresponding numbers with 
your answers to me via email.  PLEASE DO NOT POST THEM IN THIS CAT. or 
TOPIC.  I will post a summary of this survey in about 2-3 weeks.  Please 
let others know about this survey.

Thanks

      1.  How much memory in your GS?
      2.  Do you own a Hard drive? How many megs? What System Software?
      3.  Do you own a CDROM drive?
      4.  What other Peripherals do you have?
      5.  Slot Occupancy:
      6.  Do you own another computer besides the GS?
      7.  What is the primary use of your GS?
      8.  Do you write programs for the GS?
      9.  Do you belong to an Apple Users' Group? If so, which one(s)?
     10.  What is your favorite GS software?

     For the next three or four questions, please don't answer with items 
currently being worked on and/or upgraded.  Also be very realistic, if 
possible.  AWGS 2.0 is a dead issue so don't put that as an answer.

     11.  What piece of software that has been written would you like to 
          see upgraded?  What kind of enhancements would you like to see 
          added to it or improved?
     12.  What new program would you like to see come out for the GS?
     13.  Any new hardware/peripherals you would like to for the GS?
     14.  Any you would like to see revised?
     15.  For questions 11-14, how much money would you be willing to pay 
          for each. (Try to consider the program writers or hardware 
          developers time and effort)
     16.  With such a small and limited market for the GS, do you feel 
          there should be competition among software or hardware? (For 
          example: AutoArk and HardPressed)  
     17.  Feel free to add anything else about the GS:

Again, Please email your answers (I don't need the questions) to

NEW RAM CARDS FROM ALLTECH   My Sirius 8 meg board arrived on Wednesday so 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""   here's my assessment:

     THe layout wasn't what I expected but it was really well thought out. 
THe Simms lie to the right of the board.  Not like usual Ram cards where 
the chips are on the left. I dig the drawing of the GS on the board.

     If you have one of those "covers" for cables and stuff on by the 
memory slot, you'll need to take it off or turn it so it is straight up and 
down.  Any other way will cause the end of the board to stick up and not 
allow you to put the cover on.  You can also break what appears to be 
connected jumpers on the board.

     A memory check and utilites disk comes with the board.  My was either 
blank or corrupted but I'm getting another one.

     As I mentioned before the price was $199, $212 for UPS blue from CA

MINIMUM REGISTRATIONS--MAXIMUM REGISTRATIONS   Just a Word from the Kfest 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   Sponsor and Financial Big 
Cheese...

     This year's KansasFest's registrations have sped up to a blinding 
Email blur over the last week.  All those who wish to take advantage of the 
$325 'pre-registration' offer are advised that the 80 beds we have at Avila 
College for this summer's conference are a maximum.  In English, this means 
that if you register for Kfest before the deadline, but are after prior 
registrees fill up the 80 available beds at Avila, at best you will be 
'waiting-listed' for a dorm room at Avila and, at worst, doomed to the 
several hundred more potential dollars it will cost you to navigate the 
intrigues of Kansas City in mid July.

     May 1st is hard upon us, as we reach our minimum.  Register now for 
the 20th anniversary of the Apple computer, or the 10th anniversary of the 
Apple IIGS!

     And, if you have a Mac or a Newton, be advised that Apple Computer, 
Inc, will be at KFest '96 to divulge secrets of the latest computer 
systems.

     If you miss Kfest '96, hang it up and buy a DOSBox, though we in A2 
will pity and love you anyway ;-)

TENTATIVE SCHEDULE OF EVENTS   There is, but it's really an "alpha version" 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   right now:(  Coordinating events, speakers, 
times, etc. results in a lot of changes.  Rather than mislead anyone, it's 
best to wait until the schedule is a little closer to "finalization".  BTW, 
now would be a good time for any input on what YOU would like to see at 
KFest!

     As far as the 20th, the major event we know is scheduled would be the 
"Vendor Fair".  If you don't have to leave too early, you wouldn't miss 
that.  Other sessions may be scheduled concurrently depending on the 
conflicts we have on the 18th and 19th.  With luck, there won't be a "Part 
II" scheduled on the 20th.

     Hope this helps your KFest planning a little.  Please follow the

remember that KFest will be what everyone here wants it to be, if we work

RTF TRANSLATOR FOR GRAPHICWRITER III   April 9, 1996 -- EGO Systems is 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   pleased to announce the upcoming 
release of a new RTF Translator module for Seven Hills Software's 
GraphicWriter III page layout program.

     "RTF" stands for "Rich Text Format."  This is a file format 
specifically designed to allow formatted text information to be easily 
moved from one computer platform to another.  So, using this translator, 
GraphicWriter III users can import RTF files created on ANY computer! 

     When you import an RTF file into GraphicWriter III, here's what the 
translator sqeezes out of the file for you:

 -*- Font Information:  Typeface (Times, Helvetica, etc), size (10 point, 
     24 point, etc.) and style (bold, superscript, etc.) information is all 
     preserved!

 -*- Text Colors:  Colored text in your RTF file is automatically given the 
     best matching GraphicWriter III color!

 -*- Paragraph Justification:  Was that paragraph originally centered?  Or 
     was it right justified?  No need to guess, the RTF Translator figures 
     it out for you!

 -*- Paragraph Indentation:  Each paragraph's indentation is recreated in 
     GraphicWriter III, relative to the columns in your page layout!

 -*- The Text:  Of course, all of the above would be useless if the text 
     itself wasn't imported!

     And, the RTF Translator for GraphicWriter III doesn't just import RTF 
files, it exports them as well!  This is a great way to share the text you 
create in GraphicWriter III with all those non-IIGS-owning computer users 
out there!

Requirements, Availability & Pricing   The RTF Translator for 
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''   GraphicWriter III requires 
GraphicWriter III v1.1 or later (version 2.0 is recommended but NOT 
required).  It comes on a single 3.5-inch disk and includes printed user's 
documentation.  It will ship on or before May 1st, 1996.  After that date, 
the regular price will be $24.95.  However, if you order BEFORE May 1st, 
the price will be just $19.95.  Both prices INCLUDE shipping to anywhere in 
the world!

     To order, send a check or money order for the appropriate amount (in 
U.S. funds) to:

<<<<<   The IIGS market small?  NO!  I'd never have guessed that! :-
"""""
     Seriously, though, I'm not looking to sell thousands of RTF 
translators. (I'd consider 100+ copies a success... does that sound 
unreasonable?)  But If I can't sell enough to justify even the small amount 
of time (relatively) that I've put into it, then it stands to reason that I 
couldn't sell a lot of any other product...

     Given my 6.5 years of IIGS market experience, I think that's a pretty 
well thought out conclusion.

haven't found any :-)

     Anyway, in addition to the info in the press release you should know 
that:

 -*- This translator IS based on the EGOed translator code
 -*- But I fixed every problem I knew about (the ':' problem is an example) 
     and I added a BUNCH of stuff (detailed in the press release) that

NEW GAME(S) FROM BRUTAL DELUXE   Brutal Deluxe has started coding their 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   next game for the IIGS, and Olivier 
Zardini sent me an interesting e-mail offer yesterday.  He said that if I 
had any curiousity about the process, he'd be happy to send me updates each 
week.

     I imagine that a complex game takes months and months of steady 
programming, so there would be many interim revisions.  I've already seen 
the graphics and the sprites, as those are the starting off point.  It'll 
be fascinating to see those come to life over the next few months.

     The game I refer to is depicted in an Easter Egg in Convert 3200.

     I can almost envision describing the creative process in an article 
for Shareware Solutions II.  Would folks be interested in reading something 
like that?

<<<<<   Brutal Deluxe learned a difficult lesson from The Opale Demo
"""""
     Although the coding of the Opale program wasn't difficult for them, 
they were stymied and had to stop the project because they could never find 
a graphic artist to replace the one who created those stunning graphics you 
see in the Opale Demo.  If they had had more Opale graphics, Olivier and 
Antoine would have been able to create a really amazing Opale game.

     So these days, they are going about their programming projects 
differently.  They are first working on the graphics, and when those are 
completed, then the coding begins.

     And let me tell you...they have amassed a stunning collection of 
graphics for at least several more games.

     Looking back at the release dates of their software, it looks to me 
like it takes Brutal Deluxe about 8 or 9 months to complete a project.  So, 
I'd say that we can expect some really amazing Brutal Deluxe games over the 
next few years.

RTF FOR GWIII ARRIVED; RTF FOR APPLEWORKS GS COMING?   Working around the 
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""   32K limit was 
something I TRIED to do, but it looked like just TOO much work for the 
release date (and price point) that I was shooting for.  This is really 
something that needs to be fixed in GraphicWriter itself... but I'm going 
to keep thinking about how to work around it.

     As for the sub/superscript ending problem... that's very odd.  I am 
pretty sure I put ALL of the RTF v1.3 "end mark" codes in for 
super/subscript.  E-mail me the file and I'll take a look at it.

     Which reminds me... someone here said they had a RTF file created by 
Word For Windows v2 that was giving them trouble, but I haven't heard 
anything else about it.  If the file is still a problem, PLEASE e-mail it 
to me so I can figure out what's wrong.

     As for an AWGS translator for GWIII, I've already got the code (in 
EGOed) for an IMPORT-only translator.  Would it have to be IMPORT & EXPORT?  
Or would simply importing be enough for folks?

     I ask because I've sold about 20 RTF translators already... Which is 
actually pretty good considering that I've only advertised it here on GEnie 
and the 'Net.  This makes me hopefull that I'll get a big response when the 
new catalog goes out next week!  ...So I'm thinking that an AWGS translator 
might also do quite well.

Message 130       Mon Apr 29, 1996
JOE.KOHN [SSII]              at 16:55 EDT
 
     In another topic, we're vbeen discussing Convert 3200, and when the 
discussion turned technical, I had to write to Olivier Zardini for 
clarification.

     The following message is from Olivier, and it discusses some problems 
that folks have had with Platinum Paint, and it also expands greatly on 
Convert 3200's documentation on how to use different palettes within the 
same graphic.

     As you read it, please remember that English is Olivier's second 
langauage.

Joe Kohn

                                 [*][*][*]


     Hum, about the advanced users of Convert 3200, don't worry it's sad 
but I think I am the only Power User of C3200... But with a little work, 
everybody will be able to use the software. You don't necessarily need to 
know all the features to use the software. You can learn it step by step.

     About the problem with Platinum Paint, it is not difficult to 
understand. For the 16 palettes mode - PP doesn't handle it, I have no 
solutions to give... For the 1 palette mode (16 colors), the desktop 
program use the black and the white color to draw the menus, the windows... 
The used colors are usually in the palette at the first position (0 : 
black) and the last one (15 : white). But when these colors are not in 
these positions in the palette, the display can be strange. If the first 
and the last colors in the palette are black, all the menu, windows... will 
be full black, and you won't see anything... It exactly what happens with 
PP and some pictures comming from Convert or any other converter... If your 
picture is full black, with only black colors in the palette, your screen 
will be full black... Hopefully, some good drawing software as DreamGraphix 
use a specific palette for the menu bar, so you can see the menu bar 
everytime. Convert 3200 sorts the colors in the palettes, from the darkers 
ones to the ligthers ones. So, if your picture has at least 16 colors, the 
first color will be certainly black, and the last color will be certainly 
light, so you will be able to use PP, even if the last on is not realy 
white. You will be able to see the menu bar and other bottons... Sadly, if 
your picture has less than 16 colors, the non used colors of the palette 
will be turn into black, so the first one and the last one will be black 
and you could have problem with PP. I will modify this in the next update. 
I will force the last color, if it is not used, as a white instead of a 
black. But the problem comes more from PP than for C3200. PP is unable to 
handle well all the graphics modes...

     About the 16 palettes modes and the capability to choose how many 
palettes you can use, here is an explanation. First of all, this is ONLY 
for the 16 palettes mode, that won't work for the 1 palette or the 200 
palettes mode... In the 16 palettes mode, you can use up to 16 palettes on 
the screen. You can consider the 1 palette mode as a 16 palettes mode 
picture where you use only 1 palettes (from the 16 available). So, as you 
can use 16 palettes, you have to decide which lines will use which palette. 
For exemple, if you have decided to use only 4 palettes, you can use the 
first palette for the first 50 lines, the second palette for the lines from 
51 to 100, the third palette for the line from 101 to 150 and the fourth 
palette for the lines from 151 to 200. So each quarter of the screen will 
have one palette. In Lemmings, you can see such the same thing the Ma in 
screen, the scrolling area has a palette (blue and yellow tones) and all 
the rest of the screen has another palette (brown and green tones). So you 
have to things to decide :

          - How many palette do you want to use
          - Where to use them (which lines...)

     Go into C3200, load the Happy picture, go into the statistics screen 
(the stat will be computed there) and go into the Convert Area screen. 
Choose the 16 palettes mode (red circle). Click now on 'Convert Area' 
button, you can see the window with text as 'Palette : xx' where xx is a 
number from 1 to 16. Here, C3200 use the whole 16 palettes. When the 
conversion will be ended, click on 'View Area' to have a look to the 
picture. The picture is ok. Now click again on 'View Area' but this time 
press the Apple key (Command) in the same time. Now, instead of the 
picture, you can see the palettes used. You can see the 16 palettes and you 
can see which lines used which palettes. Here, each palette is used by the 
same number of line (13 lines/palette). This is the default choice for the 
16 palettes mode. But you can choose to tell to C3200 which palette to use 
and where. Click now on the 'Convert Area' button. What happen ? Nothing 
!!! It is ok. As C3200 has already converted the area in this mode, it 
doesn't do anything. Hopefully, you can force it to convert in this mode 
again. So press the Apple key (Command) and click on 'Convert Area' button. 
The conversion is launched again... and the result will be the same than 
before. There are several reasons to force it to convert the area again. 
For example you can modify the number of colors (with '+' and '-' buttons) 
and launch again the conversion to see the difference. But the best reason 
is for the 16 palettes mode, and especially for the selection mode of the 
palettes. Here we go. So, don't remember to press Apple key in the same 
time than clicking on the 'Convert Area' button for all the following 
conversions. Press on the Option key (and on the Apple key too) and click 
on the 'Convert Area' button. You will see the Happy picture displayed in 
grey scaled tones (but darker than the grey scale mode). Move the mouse you 
will see a little cursor moving. Hit the Tab key (or Apple-Tab) and the 
color of the border will change... Click on the mouse button and move the 
mouse, you will be able to paint the lines of the pictures with the same 
tones (blue, red, yellow...) than the border color. Each color (there are 
16 colors) represent one palette. Each line colored will used t he 
associated palette. At the beginning, all the lines of the screen use the 
same palette, so the picture is nearly full black. Use now 4 palettes and 
put them as describle above (one for the first 50 lines...). You can choose 
th colors you want, the color of the palette is only here to see the 
different 16 palettes, there is no link between the colors (red. bleu, 
green...) and the tones really used in this palette at the end of the 
conversion. When you will have filled the screen with the 4 palettes, hit 
ESC key and that will launch the conversion process. But this time, in the 
'Palette : xx' message, xx will only goes from 1 to 4, because you use only 
4 palettes (instead of 16 as before). Click on the 'View area' button to 
see the result, and don't forget to have a look to the palette (press Apple 
key and click on 'View Area'). You will see clearly the 4 palettes used... 
Now that you have understood, you are able to decide yourself how many 
palettes you want to use and where you want to use them. This can be very 
usefull to put a lot of palettes on one part of the screen to have a more 
colors on this part and to put only 1 palette in large part of the screen 
where you don't need a lot of colors.

        Olivier.

ps : the update of Convert progesses... the Tiff will be completly 
recognize this time (Off course, the non true colors pictures...)

An Apple II Parody

     Many of you know Dr Steven Weyhrich as the unofficial Apple II 
historian; his 23-part history of our favorite computer is well-received as 
it is widely known (and widely available!).  Some of you also know that he 
writes song parodies.  This month, Dr Weyhrich's latest parody appears for 
the first time--a GenieLamp A2 exclusive!

     When the "death" of the Apple IIe was announced, Dr Weyrich wrote 
"Apple Pie" (to the tune of Don MacLean's "American Pie") and posted it to 
Genie's A2 RoundTable.  GenieLamp A2 reprinted it in the January 1994 
issue.  In honor of Brian Tao, a Genie user who was the A2 RT's Internet 
liasion, Dr Weyhrich wrote "Internet Fileman" (to the tune of Glen 
Campbell's "Wichita Lineman"), which we reprinted in the June 1994 issue.  
The following parody, his latest, was written specifically for GenieLamp 
A2.

Thinking About Online Communications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Phil Shapiro
   [pshapiro@aol.com]



>>> THOUGHTS ON THE POWER AND CONVENIENCE OF AUTOMATED EMAIL RESPONDERS <<<
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

     Technology commentators think the world wide web is a big deal.  I 
sort of agree.  But I've come to believe that there is something in 
cyberspace far more powerful and far-reaching than the web.  Automated 
email responders are by far the most convenient way of making information 
accessible to others.

     Consider this.  Of the ten to twenty million people who are online, 
only a fraction of them have easy web access.  And of the fraction who do 
have web access, only a fraction of these people have the time (and skill) 
needed to surf the web.

     Consider how long it takes to get to a web page, and the possible 
obstacles that could occur.  It takes at least a minute to boot your web 
browser.  Then the web server you're trying to reach could be busy.  Line 
noise could drop your connection halfway over to the web page.  Your web 
browser could freeze (or crash).  And when you get to the page you're 
aiming to reach, it may or may not be obvious where on the page the 
document you're looking for is located.

     Unless you have a high speed, highly reliable online connection, it 
takes an average of about four to five minutes to get to a web page.  This 
doesn't sound so long as a single unit of time.  But if you multiply four 
to five minutes several hundred times, you're starting to look at some 
serious impositions on your time.

     Compare this with the speed and ease of retrieving a file from an 
automated email responder.  The time span between the moment you see 
mention of the file to the moment you're actually seeing the file itself 
can be as little as one minute.

     If the mention of the file happens to reach you at your email 
mailbox, then it takes just a flick of the wrist to copy and paste the 
email address and corresponding file request command into a new email 
message.  If you're skilled at using your computer, this task can be done 
in twenty seconds (or less).

     In my experience, email responders tend to return the requested file 
within one to two minutes of their receiving the request.  You just can't 
beat that for convenience.  Not only is it easier for people to retrieve 
files via automated email responders, but the potential audience for any 
responder file is magnitudes larger than the audience of people on the web.

     Every single person who is online, by definition, can send and 
receive email.  Even total newbies can master automated email responders 
with a minimum of effort.

     Last month I set up the capability of distributing text files via 
automated email responder from my local internet service provider.  The 
cost?  Just $10 per month to set up a majordomo mailing list with automated 
file archive retrieval.

     As the owner of this list, I can put whatever files I want in the 
file archive for this list.  My internet service provider tells me I could 
put several hundred separate messages in this list's file archives.

     I like that.  Makes it easy for me to deliver files to people who 
could benefit from the things I write about.

     To test how this mailing list works, I typed up a whimsical file 
giving detailed instructions of how to train golden retrievers to retrieve 
email.  You (or your dog) can retrieve this file by sending the following 
request:

          get  phils-ideas  golden.retrievers.txt

to the address:   majordomo@his.com

     Within about a minute, you (or your dog) will be able to read about 
golden retrievers doing what they do best.

     Having assured myself that this magic really does work, I went about 
placing some other files for people to retrieve.

     To help other teachers learn how to use their Apple II computers 
online, I made available instructions on how to use ZLink, the most popular 
shareware communications program.  This file can be retrieved by sending 
the request:

          get phils-ideas  zlink.howto

to the address:  majordomo@his.com

     Having tasted how powerful this communications channel can be, I 
followed a third whim and made available a large text file I captured, 
containing all of the 1996 books acquired by the Montgomery County, 
Maryland library system.  This local library system has an excellent online 
card catalog which allows you to search by the year the book was published.

     To retrieve this file (which is about 200 kilobytes in size), you can 
send the request:

          get phils-ideas   mcpl.books.1996

to the address:  majordomo@his.com

     The potential uses of automated email responders are just beginning 
to be appreciated.  Commercial uses are the ones that seem to have gained 
the fastest foothold.

     I can also imagine nonprofit organizations benefiting in a large way 
from automated email responders.  A simply-phrased text file named 
"volunteers" could list in detail the kind of volunteer help that a 
nonprofit could benefit from.  The volunteer coordinator for this 
organization could update this file daily (or even several times daily), 
spelling out the organization's volunteer needs in the most easily 
accessible form imaginable.

     How can people publicize the availability of their automated email 
responder?  One of the most sensible ways is via an existing mailing list 
whose subscribers might likely have an interest in your announcement.

     The best part is that the announcement itself can be very short and 
sweet, minimizing the intrusion on other people's time.  They themselves 
can decide whether they have any interest in the information being provided 
by the automated email responder.

     Yes, there is an alternative to getting all tangled up in the web.  
You can unstick your feet by using (and creating) automated email 
responders.

                APPLEWORKS ANNEX /
/////////////////////////////////
The AppleWorks Gazette Follow-Up
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     In the March 1996 issue, we took a look at the premiere issue of _The 
AppleWorks Gazette_.  The second issue arrived in our mailbox recently, so 
we'll take a quick peek to see how the issue stacks up when it doesn't have 
to include so much "obligatory" material, such as the AppleWorks 5.1 
update.

     As with the first issue, there are three parts to this magazine on 
disk:  the newsletter itself, software, and data.  Overall, the second 
issue looks much as the first one did, only slightly better.

NEWSLETTER   The second newsletter (still an AppleWorks word processing
""""""""""   file) stacks up like this:

      1.  Actively AppleWorks
      2.  The Main Menu
      3.  The NewsReel
      4.  At the News Stand
      5.  Letters to the Editors
      6.  How to Modify the AppleWorks Default Macros
      7.  One Touch Commands [review]
      8.  AppleWorks on the Mac--A First Look
      9.  Shrink II
     10.  More Features I Wish I Had in AppleWorks 5.1
     11.  New Utilities for AppleWorks 4.3 and 5.1
     12.  Do It Yourself Hard Drives
     13.  Inside AppleWorks: Questions and Answers
     14.  Inside AppleWorks: AppleWorks Segments
     15.  How to Cook Your Own oa-H Command
     16.  How to Reach Us

     For readers who are Genie regulars, the NewsReel continues to be 
little more than a rehash of old news.  There are a few gems from the 
Internet's comp.sys.apple2 newsgroup and from CompuServe's AppUser forum.  
A new column, At the News Stand, examines the most recent issues of other 
Apple II newsletters.  (We editors are able to eke out a meagre living by 
taking in one another's laundry.)

     In the letters to the editor, one reader points out--as I did, here 
in GenieLamp A2, two months back--that the premiere issue of _The 
AppleWorks Gazette_ was geared to AppleWorks 5 users, and geared toward 
screen layout rather than printed layout.  The editors seem to prefer to 
run their publication that way, but are willing to make changes to make 
life easier for readers, as evidenced by Serreau's editorial.

     Once again, the newsletter has some good articles.  Howard Katz 
expands on Chris Serreau's wish list for AppleWorks, which I liked very 
much, and I was pleased to see that Will Nelken and Ryan Suenaga are guest 
writers for this issue.  As before, no serious complaints with the 
newsletter, but the spelling-checker still doesn't get used enough.

ON THE DISK   The software on the premiere issue gave the disk a sparse 
"""""""""""   feel, since so much room was taken up with the AppleWorks 5.1 
update and with ShrinkIt 3.4.  Things are little better this month--the 
only "golden oldie" is Harold Portnoy's Change-A-File program.  This is an 
indispensable utility, but hardly new.  Also on the disk this month are two 
new inits--one to bring a monthly calendar to AppleWorks 5.1, and one to 
manage inits by enabling and disabling them--bug-fix updates for TimeOut 
File Librarian and Word Count, an index of TimeOut-Central, a collection of 
Roy Barrows' macros, and Joe Walters' Merlin macros.  This month's 
non-Apple II feature is H. G. Wells's "The Island of Dr. Moreau".

     In the premiere issue, ShrinkIt was used on everything but the 
newsletter, everything else in the main directory, and of course ShrinkIt 
itself.  In this issue, the macros and other data have been packed with 
ShrinkIt, but the inits, update scripts, and Change-A-File have not.

PROGRESS REPORT   _The AppleWorks Gazette_ has made some improvements and 
"""""""""""""""   is in the process of making others to be sure they serve 
their readers well.  There continues to be good stuff here, both for the 
AppleWorks user and the UltraMacros programmer.

/////////////////////////////////
Top 10 Files for March
""""""""""""""""""""""
by Douglas Cuff
    [EDITOR.A2]



     This feature lists the ten most popular files for the month.  To give 
files a chance to seek their own levels, no files will be added to the list 
until they've been in place at least a month.  This month, we look at the 
files uploaded 1-31 March 1996.

     This isn't the Academy Awards ceremony, folks; it's more like the 
People's Choice Awards (both of which are trademarked, by the way).  The 
Top 10 doesn't necessarily tell you what's new and interesting--what files 
_you_ might find interesting--it simply tells you what files have been 
downloaded a lot--what other people found interesting!

     This month, I'm pleased but a little embarrassed to find that three 
different editions of GenieLamp A2 occupy three spots in the Top 10.  This 
month, I'll let it stand because I'm so proud of the new hyper-editions, 
but if it occurs again, I'll list additional files so that the list has 10 
different files, not just ten different file names.

A2.DOM.9603.BXY   The A2 RoundTable Disk of the Month continues to be a 
"""""""""""""""   favorite download.  The March issue contains three 
newsletters--GenieLamp A2 (March), GenieLamp A2 (January), and II Something 
(January 14).  Apple IIe and IIc users will enjoy DOS 3.3 Launcher, 
IMunger, and a BASIC game called Treasure.  For the Apple IIgs user, there 
are 10 pics from Bloofadoofa, a small HyperStudio word processor called 
MicroWord, and two New Desk Accessories, one to print the screen and 
another to save the screen as a picture.

NEWPT3FIX.BXY   PT3FIX by John Kielkopf patches ProTERM's normal modem port
"""""""""""""   driver (PT3.CODE0) to allow interrupts so that software 
such AppleTalk and Twilight II will operate without data loss from the 
modem.  This patch works only with ProTERM v3.1, and only with the Apple 
IIgs modem port.  It requires a high-speed modem with hardware handshaking, 
and the appropriate cable.  Freeware.

ALMP9603.HC.BXY   The March 1996 GenieLamp A2 in HyperCard IIgs format.  
"""""""""""""""   Thanks to HyperCard programmer Joshua Calvin, you can 
enjoy GenieLamp A2 without having to leave HyperCard.  Calvin's stack can 
automatically generate a table of contents for _any_ issue of GenieLamp.  
(If you don't already own HyperCard IIgs, consider downloading file #22200, 
HCGSSTARTER.BXY.)  Freeware.

NAUG.CAT.BXY   This ASCII text file contains a catalog of all of the 
""""""""""""   National AppleWorks User Group (NAUG) disks that are 
currently available from Shareware Solutions II.

GSE4.32.BXY   GS Entertainment by Clayburn W. Juniel, III is a kind of 
"""""""""""   jukebox that plays music and shows pictures too.  It can 
display PNT graphics, PIC graphics, 256 and 3200 color graphics, INI 
desktop graphics, and ANI animations!  It can simultaneously play music 
from Music Composer, Music Studio, SoundSmith, or SynthLab, as well as 
rSounds, HyperStudio and HyperCard IIgs formatted sound files, and "just 
plain sound files".  (Earlier versions were featured on last month's 
bandwagon.) Shareware ($10).

KEYBOARD.BXY   Keyboard NDA v1.0.1 by Wilfried Ricken lets you see which 
""""""""""""   keys to press to generate special characters.  If you hold 
down a modifier key such as Option or Shift, the layout changes to reveal 
characters not normally available.  Includes the numeric keypad in its 
display.  Click near the bottom of the NDA window to change the font.  
(Keyboard translation must be set to Standard first.)  Freeware.

ALMP9603.HS.BXY   The March 1996 GenieLamp A2 in HyperStudio IIgs format.  
"""""""""""""""   This prototype version convinced me to produce a 
HyperStudio edition every month, to accompany Josh Calvin's HyperCard 
edition.  Since this is a prototype, it's not tidied up and it uses a 
little more memory than it needs to, but there aren't any serious problems.  
(If you don't own HyperStudio, you can still view this stack by downloading 
and using file ##24732 HS3.1RJ.BXY.)  Freeware.

LETITRIDE.BXY   Let It Ride by Thad T. Taylor is a single-player version of 
"""""""""""""   the Nevada casino game.  It lets you play five card stud 
poker.  The game is a little crude and the instructions sketchy, but on the 
other hand, it's a relief to see more software for the IIgs with a 1996 
copyright date.  Freeware.

GLAMPA29603.BXY   The March 1996 GenieLamp A2 in AppleWorks word processor 
"""""""""""""""   format.  This "old standard" Apple II-specific edition 
has been available since April 1993, yet some people still think you _have_ 
to own AppleWorks to view it.  Not so.  Download file #16674, QUICKVIEW.BXY 
or file #24324, QUIKVIEW1.1.BXY and you'll be able to read the same 
GenieLamp A2 that the editor uses as the basis for all other versions.  
Freeware.

A2.LIB.ADB.BXY   This index of the A2 RoundTable libraries, collected by 
""""""""""""""   Tom Zuchowski, lists the whole of the software collection 
in one AppleWorks data base file.  For AppleWorks users with large 
desktops!  Indices of separate libraries are also available for AppleWorks 
users with smaller desktops, as are text file indices, for those who don't 
use AppleWorks.  Freeware.

~ Christian Serreau and Howard Katz, editors of _The AppleWorks Gazette_ ~

     _The AppleWorks Gazette_ is a new disk magazine for AppleWorks users 
and programmers.  This month, we visit with the two editors--Christian 
Serreau (France) and Howard Katz (United States).

                                 [*][*][*]


GenieLamp>   Would you tell us how you first became interested in the
"""""""""    Apple II?  Was it your first computer?

Serreau>   An original Apple ][.  I bought it in November 1977 from a
"""""""    colleague that didn't want to spend more time trying to load 
programs from the tape recorder.  It still work well, though I must admit I 
don't power it up very often :)  My first contact with computers dates back 
to 1973 when I used punch-hole cards on a mainframe to handle a MA degree 
paperwork data.

Katz>   A friend of mine had a ][+ that he had to sell for business
""""    reasons, and he made me a deal for the whole package.  However, 
this wasn't my first computer.  When I was a pre-teen, my parents bought me 
a kit that was a _mechanical_ computer--you set some slides, and 
push/pulled on the handle to make it work.  I never did figure how to read 
the answer, tho.  And I did make an abacus at Boy Scout camp.


GenieLamp>   When did you first become interested in AppleWorks?
"""""""""
Katz>   It took a while.  I started my Apple II career with the purchase of
""""    a second-hand ][+, and stuck with the word processor I use on it 
when I moved to my //e.  It took quite a bit of coaxing from a friend of 
mine to prove to me that AppleWorks wasn't as complicated as I thought it 
might be.

Serreau>   I've been using it from the start.  I still have a few notes
"""""""    about v1.0 and v1.0R, though I'm not sure I could easily locate 
the disks.  Those who already owned an Apple ][ in the late '70s and early 
'80s sure remember a few milestones in software:  they were QuickFile, 
ProDOS, and then AppleWorks.  AW really changed the way the Apple //e could 
be used:  a true word processor, and a data base you could use without 
first quitting the program.  The release of AppleWorks could be compared to 
the introduction of the "Shugart" 5.25" drive: you suddenly saw you cpu 
with different eyes.  It should also be remembered that, when AppleWorks 
was first introduced, no comparable software was available for other 
platforms, even for the IBM PC. Considering the whole thing ex post, I 
would bet that, if Apple had developed what was then known as the Apple 
IIx--i.e. a 16-bit text-based Apple II--and a compatible, which means 
faster, version of AppleWorks, things would have been much different.


GenieLamp>   Chris, some of our readers will remember your AppleWorks First
"""""""""    Kit.  For those that don't remember, what was it?

Serreau>   It was an attempt to make AppleWorks 4.02, then 4.3, more
"""""""    flexible.  There are a lot of features in those versions that 
can easily be customized so that they're closer to what the user needs, but 
you can't find any built-in menu to do it.  The Kit contains a number of 
init files that do the job.  Except for the last version, that includes a 
fileviewer, the Kit does not add any feature to AppleWorks.  I hope there 
will be versions for 3.0 and 5.1 in the future, but I'm afraid I don't know 
when I shall have time to make them.


GenieLamp>   What was the significance of the name, AppleWorks First Kit?
"""""""""
Serreau>   I wanted to name it "Tool Kit", but I thought someone had
"""""""    already used that name.  As it was the first time AppleWorks 
could be patched with init files (and not the old on-disk patches), I 
changed "Tool" to "First".


GenieLamp>   Howard, I believe you had some articles published in NAUG's
"""""""""    _AppleWorks Gazette_.  What can you tell us about that?

Katz>   I was a NAUG member for around 5 years before I 1st wrote anything
""""    for them.  My first article happened because of a printer problem.  
I had just gotten a laser printer after trial, error, and numerous phone 
calls to the manufacturer, I found out that fonts weren't additive like my 
dot matrix.  I then came across John Majka's Font Downloader program, and 
realized that his program, plus information in the printer manual meant 
AppleWorks users could use virtually any font.  I simply put two pieces of 
information together and then submitted the article to Warren Williams, who 
published it.

     After that, Warren asked me to do several projects for NAUG, 
including the SEG.ER printer drives disks, and the US Government disks, as 
well as several software reviews.


GenieLamp>   How did you two first "meet"?
"""""""""
Serreau>   Howard registered his copy of the First Kit, and asked for a few
"""""""    more features.

Katz>   ...after trying it out, I contacted him with a few suggestions, for
""""    which he let me beta test the next few versions of the kit.  All of 
our contacts have been made via e- and snailmail.

GenieLamp>   So you've never actually met.  Any plans to meet?
"""""""""    Any reason to?

Serreau>   It's actually a matter of time.  I went to DC last year, but
"""""""    never had time to take a plane to Chicago and meet Howard.  I'm 
pretty sure I won't be able to attend this year's KansasFest (I wasn't able 
to come last year and the year before, either :), as July is the month when 
university professors are asked as chairmen for the French "baccalaureat" 
(the equivalent of your high school diploma), and when we make some kind of 
plans for the coming university year, too.  Maybe later...

GenieLamp>   How is it that you decided to produce a magazine together? 
"""""""""    Who had the idea?  Who approached who?

Katz>   It's hard to recall to be honest.  I think we both were lamenting
""""    the demise of NAUG, and decided that there was still a market for 
an AppleWorks-related publication.  I think the idea just grew out of our 
discussions.

Serreau>   When ICON stopped the publication of TO Central, I thought there
"""""""    was room for an AppleWorks-related publication.  I even designed 
a four-page paper-based magazine, named "YAAWN!" (Yet Another AppleWorks 
Newsletter!".  I soon realized that going further would mean spending a lot 
of time in page layout and printing, and the project was stopped there.  
When NAUG stopped publishing the Forum and closed its doors, Howard 
suggested that there could be a continuation to the NAUG publication.  
Howard also brought the name.


GenieLamp>   How often will you publish?
"""""""""
Katz>   6 times a year.
""""
Serreau>   We go bimonthly.  I first thought of a quarterly publication,
"""""""    but Howard convinced me that 6 disks a year would be even 
better.


GenieLamp>   How much will a subscription be?
"""""""""
Serreau>   U.S.$35 a year, worldwide mail included.
"""""""
Katz>   For our non-US friends, I've made arrangements with a financial
""""    company that will cash foreign-drawn checks for an additional 
$2.50/check.  I have to rely on the subscriber to find out and figure out 
what the check amount should be in relation to currency exchange rates.


GenieLamp>   What do you see as the focus of _The AppleWorks Gazette_?
"""""""""
Katz>   Well, AppleWorks.  However, with 800k of room to work with, we're
""""    finding that we're becoming more like a cross between RESOURCE 
CENTRAL and NAUG's FORUM.  The 1st two issues have had a mix of software 
reviews, and technical information, and we've received feedback from our 
readers which we'll use to tailor the contents of future issues.

Serreau>   And Apple ][-related issues, too, as you can't run the software
"""""""    without the computer :)


GenieLamp>   Do you produce one version for all subscribers, or do you have
"""""""""    versions specially tailored to load into AppleWorks v3.0, 
v4.x, v5.x, etc?

Serreau>   We're working on the "one size fits all" principle.  The
"""""""    newsletter comes in AppleWorks 5.1 word processor format, and we 
provide an updated version of Mark Munz's QuickView for pre-5 users.  This 
is far from being perfect, but we couldn't have three versions of a 200K 
newsletter on the same disk without reducing the amount of software and 
data.  And producing three different disks would have been a nightmare for 
the one that puts disks into envelopes :)

Katz>   Most of the information can be read with AW3, but since we're
""""    making heavy use of AW4 and AW5's ability to display Mousetext 
characters as well as inverse characters, users of the later versions will 
get the full impact of the formatting.


GenieLamp>   Do you offer _The AppleWorks Gazette_ in 3.5" and 5.25"
"""""""""    formats?

Serreau>   The standard size is 3.5".  It _is_ possible to subscribe for
"""""""    5.25" disks, but we cannot include some of the software or data 
files on the disks.

Katz>   ....the vast majority of our subscribers have requested 3.5" disks.
""""


GenieLamp>   Will you be having "outside talent" write for _The AppleWorks
"""""""""    Gazette_, or will you do it all yourselves?

Katz>   I think both of us would burn out quickly if we had to do
""""    everything ourselves.

Serreau>   We already had Will Nelken and Ron Suenaga for articles, and Roy
"""""""    Barrows and Joe Walters for software.  A few others are 
expected.

GenieLamp>  I think you mean Ryan Suenaga. <grin>
"""""""""
Serreau>  My apologies for that [the typographical error].  The paper came
"""""""   in with "Ron M. Suenaga" in the header, and I didn't check with 
the bio footer.


GenieLamp>   So you perceive your contributors as coming from your
"""""""""    subscribers?

Katz>   We're hoping to have contributors from across the Apple II
""""    spectrum.

Serreau>   We hope that many files will come from the readers, as they are
"""""""    the ones who know how they use AppleWorks on a daily basis.

Katz>   If any of our subscribers wish to submit an article, and we publish
""""    it, we'll extend their subscription by 1 month.


GenieLamp>  What can we look forward to in future issues of The AppleWorks
"""""""""   Gazette?

Serreau>   As far as articles are concerned, I'll write a number of papers
""""""""   in the "Inside AppleWorks" series.  The next one should be about 
AppleWorks inits, with a focus on the PatchManager and dot commands (two 
different topics).  In the "tips and techniques" column, we'll have 
something about machine language and macros, and how to assemble a file 
without an assembler.  The software subdirectories will contain updates for 
a number of TimeOut applications (either never updated or updated with 
bugs), some new applications and init files, and a few new dot commands.  
Of course, that is my own stuff only, and as more people contribute to the 
Gazette, there will be much more than that.


GenieLamp>   Does Howard mail out the issues to the subscribers closest to
"""""""""    him and Chris handle the rest, or how is it handled?

Serreau>   If things go well, that's how it should work in the end.  Right
"""""""    now, all disks are duplicated, labelled and shipped from France.


GenieLamp>   Does it cost a lot to mail an issue from France?
"""""""""
Serreau>   $1.64 per disk.  It may seem a lot, but it's actually less that
"""""""    what we would have to pay to get the disks duplicated in the US.  
I have a free access to what seems to be one of the last GCR disk 
duplicators in Paris.


GenieLamp>   Are computers a part of your daytime job?  Please tell us a
"""""""""    little about what you do between 9 and 5.

Serreau>   I'm currently teaching political science in Paris, London, and
"""""""    Moscow, which implies that I don't work much on a 9am-5pm basis.  
The use of computers is part of the work, since the only way to find the 
document you need is to maintain a very large data base.  That part of the 
work is done with the help of a Mac connected to a mainframe.  But I may 
read documents with the Apple //e I have at my office in Paris, provided 
that they're not too long.

Katz>   My college training was supposed to lead me to be a high school
""""    teacher, so of course I ended un in another field.  I ended up in 
the medical insurance field, where I've done everything from claims to 
training underwriters.  I've also become Adjunct Faculty at a couple of 
local medical schools working with 2nd year Med students.


GenieLamp>   What sorts of things do you like to do for fun (i.e.
"""""""""    non-computer hobbies)?

Katz>   I'm active in local politics and am currently running for a County
""""    Commissioner position.  I do a fair amount of public speaking on 
behalf of several organizations, and I also enjoy reading, mostly SciFi, as 
well as skydiving.

Serreau>   I'm collecting stamps and Rolls-Royce cars.  But, if you have a
"""""""    spare RR in your garage you want to dispose of, don't bother 
sending it to me.  In order to keep my monthly gas bill within reasonable 
limits, I decided I would collect 1/43 RR model cars only.


GenieLamp>   How did you get involved in telecommunications?
"""""""""
Katz>   I got my 1st modem in 1985, and stumbled upon a small online
""""    service called Mnematics out of NY.  I became their Politics SIG 
leader, and conducted weekly online discussions.

Serreau>   Well, I really began to use telecoms when I moved back to France
"""""""    in 1989, first for email.  I used the french CalvaCom network 
first,and then moved to CIS when they made their services available in 
France.  Before that, I had been using CIS and The Source when in Berkeley, 
but that was many years ago, I'm afraid...


GenieLamp>   Howard, I seem to recall you're an old America Online hand.
"""""""""    How long have you been a member of Genie?  What new services 
do you think Genie should provide its subscribers?

Katz>   Actually, I was a Genie member up until around 1988.  At that time,
""""    they changed their billing methods (I forget the details), and I 
remember not caring for the open vein into my credit card.  I became a 
charter member of AOL (then called AppleLink), and was a regular over there
