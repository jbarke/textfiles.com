                        | How to Operate Your Starship |
                        +------------------------------+


        +------------+
        | Hyperdrive |
        +------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The hyperdrive is a propulsion system that allows travel at faster-than-light speeds by pusing the spacecraft into an alternate dimension-set called hyperspace. Once in hyperspace, the spacecraft is no longer subject to the rules which govern motion in normal space. Due to the chaotic nature of hyperspace, the aiming system used in reentry is only accurate enough to return the user to a particular star, not a particular planet.

Application:

      The hyperdrive is used to tracel between startsystems. It is not accurate enough to use for interplanetary travel. Hyperdrive motors are equipped with the special feature, overload. Overloading the hyperdrive will destroy any other ships within a 50,000 meter radius. It should only be used for emergencies, since it severly damages your hyperdrive.

Warnings:

      Never attempt to operate the hyperdrive with an orbital radius of less than 20,000 kilometers or damage may result.
      Never attempt to make trips of less than 1 light-year; i.e., 0 light-years, as damage may result.


        +-----------------+
        | Sub-Light Drive |
        +-----------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The sub-light drive comes in several different forms. some depend on ejecting matter at very high velocities while others use controlled gravity to drive the ship forward in space. Due to the speed of light being an absolute limit on anything traveling in normal space, a trip between even the closest of starsystesm would take years using sup-light drive.

Applications:

      The sub-light drive is used for travel between planets in the same starsystem and manuevering between objects in orbit about a planet.


        +--------+
        | Bridge |
        +--------+

Theory of Operation:

      The bridge is the section of the ship where the captain resides.

Application:

      The bridge is not actually featured in the game except that it is assumed the captain is in it while giving commands.

Warning:

      The ship is destroyed and the game ends if bridge damage goes below 1 damage point.

        +--------------+
        | Accumulators |
        +--------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The accumulators are the intermediate storage area between power generation and consumption. They are nothing more than high-efficiency large-capacity batteries. Converters can only provide a slow, steady current while some application, such as using the hyperdrive, require brief bursts of enormous power. The accumulators can provide this capability by storing power over a period of time and releasing it instantly.

Application:

      Power flow through the accumulators is automatic.


        +-----------+
        | Converter |
        +-----------+

Theory of Operation:

      The converter tracnsforms Ore IV (a radioactive isotope of hydrogen) into electrical energy.

Application:

      The converter operates automatically any time the power leve in the accumulators is less than the power required for a particular job. When the converter is running, it produces a low "whirring" sound. If there is not enough Ore IV for the amount of power required, the computer will beep rapidly and fail to complete its current job. The converter will automatically deplete your Ore IV supply.

Warning:

      The ship is destroyed and the game ends if converter damage goes below 1 damage points.


        +-----------------+
        | Docking Adapter |
        +-----------------+

Theory of Operation:

      Attached to the exterior of the ship, the docking adapter seals around the outside of another ship's airlock. this allows transfer of goods and personnel to be conducted without the need of breathing equipment.

Applications:

      the adapter is used to transfer bouading troops into a target ship and transfer captured goods back to the attacking ship. It is automatically used when you are boarding another spacecraft in the Weapons section.


        +----------------------+
        | Inertial Compensator |
        +----------------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The intertial compensator creates a localized internal gravity field in the spacecraft.

Application:

      A sup-light drive will produce sufficient acceleration to squash the crew inside a spacecraft. The inertial compensator protects the crew from the effects of acceleraton by creating an artificial internal gravity field that protects the crew from acceleration.

Note:

      If you do not have an inertial compensator, your maximun acceleration will be limited to 3 gravities.


        +-----------------+
        | Orbital Scanner |
        +-----------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The orbital scanner is a sophisticated radar that detect objects spacecraft-size bodies on a solar scale. It cannot generate a picture or discern particular features of an object, it can only tell if something is there.

Application:

      The scanner is used to find drydock, high resolution scanning targets, attacking spacecraft, planets orbiting about a star, and the spacecraft's position in space.

Important:

      The user must be within range of a scanning beacon to produce an orbital scan. The scanning beacon is a satellite located at an orbital radius equal to five times the radius of the planet.


        +------------------+
        | Resource Scanner |
        +------------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The resource scanner is used to scan planetary surfaces for traces of Ores I-IV and indicate optimum mining sites.

Application:

      The resource scanner is automatically switched on when the user begins mining sites and displays ore concentration, natural hostility, and population sophistication daya on each one. This enables you to select the site with the best danger of payoff ratio.


        +-------------------------+
        | High Definition Scanner |
        +-------------------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The high definition scanner uses a large part of the electromagnetic spectrum in order to produce a highly detailed picture of an object and an account of the spacecraft's most probable configuration.

Application:

      The high definition scanner can be used to determine whether a particular target presents a threat. it can also be used to find choice targets to board and plunder.


        +-------------+
        | Missle Rack |
        +-------------+

Theory of Operation:

      A term referring to the system of racks, conveyors, and lifts used to bring missles fro its storage area into firing position.

Application:

      The storage of missles occurs automatically as they are purchased.

Warning:

      If the missle rack is destroyed, all your ship's missles will be lost.


        +-----------------+
        | Missle Launcher |
        +-----------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The missle launcher launches the missles and provides primary course guidance.

Application:

      Operation of the missle launcher occurs automatically as firing is requested.


        +-------+
        | Laser |
        +-------+

Theory of Operation:

      The lasers used as weaponry are the flexible-aperture micropulse type. They emit entese beams of coherent light to blind or puncture enemy targets.

Application:

      The laser can be used for defense or offense against targets in orbit. Note that the laser cannot be aimed at ground targets (it diffuses and becomes ineffective) or at drydocks (programmed inhibition).


        +------------------+
        | Shield Generator |
        +------------------+

Theory of Operation:

      the shield generator contains a very fast scanner that checks space around the ship for incoming fire. Within 10 millionths of a second after the scanner detects and incoming object or energy beam, the shield generator shoots a pulse of intense gravity. The gravity either destorys the object, as in the case of a missle, or it distorys and difusses it, as in the case of laser beam.

Application:

      Functioning of the shield generator is automatic and occurs whenever you are fired upon. The shield may only be able to stop a fraction of the incoming fire.


        +---------------------------+
        | Electronic Countermeasure |
        +---------------------------+

Theory of Operation:

      Electronic warfare dates back to the late Twentieth Century (Common Era) and the basic elements are still the same. Electronic countermeasure, or ECM, is the process of jamming your opponent's tracking radar and missle guidance systems. This dramatically reduces the odds of an incoming missle hitting your ship.

Application:

      The ECM will automatically jam missiles as they come in.


        +-----------------+
        | Assult Capsules |
        +-----------------+

Theory of Operation:

      Assault capsules are electro-gravitically driven space shuttles used to land troops on the surface. They are heavily armoured and contain two or more VoigtEffect cannons.

Application:

      The assault capsule is used to clear a hostile area prior to deplyment of ore processors.


        +------------+
        | Crew Armor |
        +------------+

Theory of Operation:

      Crew armor is used to protect the crew from injury and supply additional speed and payload capacity during boarding or ground assaults.

Application:

      The computer will automatically ask you for armor when it is needed. You may have only one unit of armor per crew member.


        +---------------+
        | Ore Processor |
        +---------------+

Theory of Operation:

      An ore processor is a gaint mining platform that can land on the surface of habitable and airless worlds. It has no defense capability and its mining lies mus                                                                                                                              €                                                                                                                              ld |
        +------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The cargo hold stores up to eighty (80) items of varying size in an atmosphere controlled enviorment.

Application:

      Cargo is automatically stored in the cargo hold.

Warning:

      If the cargo hold is destroyed, all the cargo inside is lost.


        +-----------------+
        | Cryogenic Vault |
        +-----------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The cryogenic vault is a low-temperature (98 degrees K) storage area for passengers and prisoners. Putting non-essential personnel into suspended animation greatly reduces operating costs and accomodations size. A person entering the vauld it pumped full of cryo-protectant and his body temperature is reduced to that of liguid nitrogen. The thawing precess i rapid and a certain percentage of revivals fail.

Application:

      The cryogenic vauld can be used most profitable to carry emigrants to other worlds. Many planets need hard-working immigrants. Underpopulated worlds encourage immigration with kickbacks to transport captains such as yourself. Passengers are placed into the cryogenic vault automatically after returing from a Starport or completing a ship-to-ship boarding in Weapons.

Note:

      To find the loading status of the cryogenic vault, check the miscellaneous section of Report Status and look under the heading of "passengers."


        +-----------------+
        | Orbital Shuttle |
        +-----------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The orbital shuttle is an electro-gravitic transport used for starport-to-ship operations.

Application:

      The orbital shuttle is used to carry cargo, migrants and ore to and from starports.

Warning: 

      Orbital shuttles have extremly limited range, usually less than 1500 kilometers. It is necessary to manuever your spacecraft in an extremly low orbit to facilitate their use.


        +------------+
        | Autodoctor |
        +------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The atuodoctor is a complex medical computer/robot able to diagnose and tread a myriad of illnesses and injuries.

Application:

      The autodoctor is used to heal boarding casualities only. It will operate automatically whenever you are running the Boarding section of Weapons.


        +-------------+
        | Ore Storage |
        +-------------+

Theory of Operation:

      Ore storage is the series of compartments where ore is stored on your ship.

Application:

      Ore is automatically placed and removed in the section of the ship.


        +---------------+
        | Crew Quarters |
        +---------------+

Theory of Operation:

      The crew quarters are the section of the ship which contain the sleeping, food preparation, recreation, and sanitary facilities for the crew.

Application:

      Crew usage of these facilities is automatic.


        +-------------+
        | Rescue Pods |
        +-------------+

Theory of Operation:

      Rescue pods are a collection of 50 to 200 small plastic spheres, each with a 2 hour air supply.

Application:

      Rescue pods are used for mass personnel transfer without the need for a docking adapter.


        +----------+
        | Computer |
