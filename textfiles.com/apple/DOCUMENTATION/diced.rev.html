----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in DIcEd v1.2:

  o Edit Attributes now knows about all the new filetypes and
    auxtypes defined in the January 1989 Filetype Notes.

  o The menus are prettier.  (Separate dimmed-out dividing
    lines appear between groups of items.)

  o When you Save an icon file window and there are Edit Icon
    windows belonging to it that have not been saved back to
    the main window, a dialog appears and asks if it's okay
    to save the icons back to the main window before saving
    the file.

  o When you Save an icon file window and there are Edit Icon
    windows belonging to it that have not been saved back to
    the main window, a dialog appears and asks if it's okay
    to save the icons back to the main window before saving
    the file.

  o If there is no FONTS folder in your SYSTEM folder, DIcEd
    asks for permission to create one.  The FONTS folder is
    required for the Font Manager.  (DIcEd uses the Font
    Manager even though it doesn't use any fonts other than
    the system font (Shaston 8).  But DIcEd's clipboard can
    display pictures, stored in PICT format, and this requires
    the Font Manager to be active.)

  o No changes have been made to Save As Source yet.  Sorry.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in DIcEd v1.1.1:

  o Using New (or Apple-N) to create an empty icon file from
    scratch in previous versions _seemed_ to work okay, but
    it resulting in a file that was ignored by the Finder.
    (DIcEd was not storing a $0001 at offset 4 in the file.)

  o The correct parts of an Edit Icon window are now redrawn
    if color replacement (option-click) or icon repositioning
    (shift-drag) were done while the window was not scrolled
    to the top-left position.

  o DIcEd no longer reports fatal errors if a toolset returns
    an error when it is shut down.  This is not the ideal
    solution, but it should clear up the Fatal Error $0002
    problem many users have been having when using the Show
    Text NDA, v1.2.

----------------------------------------------------------------
New features in DIcEd v1.1:

  o The Edit Attributes filetype window knows about some new
    special filetypes used under Finder 1.2 on System Disk 4.0
    (GS/OS).

  o The Help and view-text-file windows are 4.7 zillion times
    faster now.

  o Four sizes of fat pixels are available in Edit Icon windows
    (see View menu).

----------------------------------------------------------------
Bug fixes in DIcEd v1.1:

  o Clicking in the icon area of an icon file window while
    the Edit button was disabled (when positioned at icon
    #0, before all the icons in the file) would let you
    edit this nonexistent icon, possibly leading to a crash.

  o Some users have had DIcEd 1.0 crash while quitting.  I
    believe this was because of some buggy code in the TML
    Pascal 1.50A library, and I now bypass that code.  If
    you still get crashes, I want to hear about it.

  o The rectangle around the sample icons will always be
    redrawn properly now.

  o Bogus redrawing of the fat-pixel images used to happen
    after drawing pixels and releasing the mouse if the window
    was scrolled vertically by a sufficient amount.

  o The hot spot of the Pencil cursor has been moved down
    and right by one pixel.

  o The Watch cursor is displayed while printing a text file
    to the printer.
