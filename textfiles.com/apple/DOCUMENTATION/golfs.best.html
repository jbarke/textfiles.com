               Documentation typed up by The Sheik

How to Play: 

You  are  standing  at  the tee on Hole #3 at the Pinehurst No.2 course.
It's a par four, 316/335 yards in length,  surrounded  by  bunkers.  You
must decide how to play the hole-just like on the golf course. 

1. What club should you use?
2. How hard should you swing?
3. How should you hit the ball-straight, with a slice or hook?
4. In what direction should you hit?

Let's look at the hole and "practice" a little before we hit.  Press the
2  key.  You will see a legend showing the colors, and the patterns they
represent. You will notice that the colors correspond to bunkers,  fair-
ways, greens, trees, rough, etc. Now hit any key and go back to the tee.
You can see the bunkers, trees, etc. on this hole. 

Now  let's  think about club selection. At the end of this documentation
you will see a table showing the clubs, force of swing, average roll, an
degree of loft. This table helps you determine which club to select  and
the force with which to hit-full swing, half swing, quarter swing. 

Your  golf bag contains five woods, nine irons, a sand wedge, a pitching
wedge, and a putter.  The  woods  are  numbered  1W-5W;  the  irons  are
numbered 1I-9I. The wedges are PW, SW, and the putter is PT. 

Club Selection: 

Look  at  the  bottom  left  portion  of  the  screen.  You will see six
figures:  a golfer, a golf club, a vertical line, a clock, speaker,  and
letters  with #s.  Let's talk about the club first.  Before you can hit,
you must select a club. Press the letter  'C'  and  you  will  see  this
prompt: 

Which club:0A
Type  the  two  letter  name  of  the  club  you  want  to hit with. For
illustration, type 2W. You will return to the hole. Look  at  where  the
the  club was and you should now see 2W. You have selected the two wood.
If you change your mind, type 'C' again and select a different club. You
can select a club and return it to your "bag" as many times as you need,
until you're satisfied with the selection. 

Force of Stroke: 

How hard should you hit the  ball?   Full  swing,  half  swing,  quarter
swing?  Anytime you select a wood or iron, you must decide on the swing;
this is the force or the degree of swing. 

Press the letter 'F' and you'll see the prompt: 
Full, Half, Quarter: 
Type  'Q'  and return to the hole. Look at the golfer now; he's taking a
quarter swing! (wow) Press 'F' again and respond by typing 'F'. Now he's
taking a full swing. You can adjust the swing to fit the situation.  For
illustration,  let's  use  a full swing.  NOTE: The force of stroke is a
little different for the wedges and putter. 
 We'll discuss this in a moment. 

Style-Hook, Slice, or Straight

Does this hole require a hook or  a  slice?   Do  you  need  to  hit  it
straight?   The  vertical  line  figure  means that you are set to hit a
straight shot. Press the letter 'S' and see the prompt. Hook, Slice,  or
Normal:  Respond  to the prompt by typing an 'H' for Hook. When the hole
displays, look at the vertical line-it's bending to  the  left.  If  you
typed  S, it would bend to the right.  Press S again and select a normal
style (N). Hooks and slices are highly valuable. In general, the  amount
of curve is the greatest off the tee. 

Direction: 

So far, you have selected a club, a swing, and a style. The little clock
figure  tells  you that you need to pick a direction.  Line up your shot
by imagining the ball following a line that points in the  direction  of
the  hour  hand.  Let's try this so you can see. Press the letter 'D' to
see the prompt.  Enter direction: 00:00 Type in 10:30 and try to imagine
where the hour hand is pointing when the time is 10:30. Watch while  the
game  plots your direction with a line.  Did the line intersect with the
hole?  Play around with the direction and line  the  shot  up  with  the
hole.   NOTE:  If you do not select a direction, the ball will go in the
general direction of the pin. 

Stroke the Ball: 

Are you ready?  Have you selected a club, swing,  style  and  direction?
Good!  Hit the ball by pressing 1. Watch the lower portion of the screen
as  the  computer  plots  the  flight of the ball. Hope you didn't hit a
tree! 

Quiet Please: 

Suppose you'd like to play at work (during lunch, of course!) and  don't
want to disturb anyone-especially, your boss. Press 3 anytime to silence
any  any beeps, clicks, or music and your "speaker figure" will turn off
its sound. 

A Reminder: 

The current hole you are playing and its  par  are  displayed  for  your
convenience. 

Other Features and Shots: 

See  how  easy  it  is?  How did you do?  Sometimes the ball may hook or
slice even though you hit  it  straight.  Don't  get  too  frustrated-it
happens  to  the  pros, too.  Let's play with some of the other features
before you hit your next shot. 
Range-
The range feature plots a line with a selected number of feet or  yards,
from  the  ball  to the pin. Press the 'R' key to see the prompt.  Enter
range in units?  For illustration, type 100 and press RETURN.  You  will
see a line that represents a range of 100 yards (or feet) from your ball
toward  the  pin. The computer determines if the unit should be yards or
feet, depending upon how close you are to the pin. The  "range"  feature
should  be  used  to help you determine when to "play short," or "go for
it."

Correction: 

Press the ESC key, if you see you are entering an invalid response,  and
you will return to the main prompt screen. 

The Second Shot: 

Ready  to  hit  the second shot?  If you are within 70 yards of the pin,
you will notice that you are seeing a different view of the hole. GOLF's
BEST<tm> shows three different views of the hole: one from the tee,  one
from  the  fair-  way, and one from the green.  You may need to select a
wedge for your next shot. The wedges (and putter) do not require you  to
select  a  degree  of  swing;  instead  you select force by specifying a
distance, in feet. 

Lets try a pitching wedge. Press the 'C' key, and  select  PW  (pitching
wedge). Now press 'F' key to select force. You will
Enter Force: 
Type  the  distance you with to hit the ball, in feet. Remember: You may
need  to  hit  your  second  shot.  Select  a  club,  force,  style  and
direction.   Press  1  and  watch  the  ball go. (If you ended up in the
woods, you may want to select a hunting wedge. HA!)
NOTE: You do not select a style for putts or wedge shots. 

The Putt: 

When you are on the geen and ready to putt,  press  the  letter  'C'  to
select  a  club  and type 'PT'. Press the letter 'F' to select the force
and enter the force in feet. The computer shows you  the  slope  of  the
green  by  displaying  an  arrow  that  points to the LOWEST area on the
green. Be sue to take this into consideration. 

For example, if you are 20 feet from the pin and the slope is steep, you
may need to hit with a force of 30 feet to "play the break." Now  select
a direction and press 1. Did it go in?  No?  Try agan! 

The 19th Hole: 

That's  all  there  is  to  it!   Just  select a club, force, style, and
direction to hit the ball. It's just like being on the course! 

In all cases, the normal rules of golf apply.  The  person  who  is  the
farthest  from the pin hits first; all out-of-bounds and water shos will
cost you a stroke; and no Mulligans are  allowed!   The  computer  keeps
score for you. Press 4 to see the scorecard. How are you doing? 

Sometimes the real world interferes with the important things we like to
do- like play golf. From time-to-time, we must return to work and family
duties.   The  player  who  is "up" can quit at any time: just press the
letter 'Q' and respond to the prompt by  typing  the  ltter  'Y'  (yes).
Press RETURN and you're off the couse and back at work. 

No need to take a shower, turn in your cart, or carry your clubs to your
car-they are safely stored away until the next game! 

Have a good round on Pinehurst No. 2! 

Course Rules: 

1. Player farthest from the pin hits first.
2. One stroke penlty if ball goes in the water.
3. One stroke penalty if ball goes out of bounds & loss of distance.
4. Replace all divots!
5. Courtesy demands "quiet" when a player is ready to hit.
