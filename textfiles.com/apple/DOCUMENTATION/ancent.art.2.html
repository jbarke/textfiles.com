   :  CAMPAIGN:  A campaign is a series of military maneuvers that form a     :
   :               war.  The AAoWaS comes with eleven separate campaigns,     :
   :               each set at a different location and time.  Using the      :
   :               Game Generator you can design your own campaigns.          :
   :                                                                          :
   :  COMMAND                                                                 :
   :   OPTIONS:  Are used to move through the program and to give orders to   :
   :               your ships and squadrons.  Command Options will change     :
   :               during the game but can usually be found on the bottom     :
   :               line of the screen.  After Zooming, command options can    :
   :               also be found at the top of the screen.  To use a Command  :
   :               option, press the key that is indicated or, if no key is   :
   :               indicated, press the first letter of the command.          :
   :                                                                          :
   :  CONDITION: Cannonfire and low supplies will decrease a ship's           :
   :               condition.  A ship's condition is determined by her hull   :
   :               and sail damage.  When the condition of the sails decrease :
   :               the ship's speed and maneuverability also will decrease.   :
   :               When a ship's sails are destroyed, the ship will also be   :
   :               disabled.  When the condition of a ship's hulls            :
   :               deteriorates, cannons are damaged and firepower decreases. :
   :               A ship with severe hull damage will sink.                  :
   :             To improve the condition of a ship, it must be repaired at a :
   :               repair port.  During a battle, some repairs can be made to :
   :               a badly damaged ship by boarding with a stronger friendly  :
   :               ship.                                                      :
   :                                                                          :
   :  CROWN   :  A crown represents the heart of a side's homeland.  A war    :
   :               can be won by anchoring a ship next to a Crown of the      :
   :               opposite color, but first, all enemy ships at the Crown    :
   :               must be defeated.  A Crown provides supplies and repairs   :
   :               to ships of the same color.  Crowns are supplied from      :
   :               inland and do not require merchantships.                   :
   :                                                                          :
   :  DETACH  :  If a squadron contains more than one ship, and ther are      :
   :               fewer than 40 squadrons on the map (including any enemy    :
   :               squadrons not shown), you can divide the squadron in two.  :
   :               Put the marker over the squadron.  When "Detach" appears   :
   :               on the command line, press D.  Use + or - to select a ship :
   :               and then press S to switch it to the new squadron.  When   :
   :               you are done, press E.  The new squadron will appear just  :
   :               to the right of the original squadron.  By typing J (join) :
   :               you can move ships back to the original squadron.          :
   :                                                                          :
   :  ENCOUNTER: If one of your squadrons comes close to an enemy squadron,   :
   :               an encounter will be reported, and both squadrons will     :
   :               turn into the shape of crossed sabres.  You can either     :
   :               take command of that squadron and lead it into battle, by  :
   :               Zooming, or let the ships fight without your help.  If the :
   :               two squadrons start flashing, it means they have started   :
   :               fighting without you.  You can check the size of both      :
   :               squadrons while they are flashing to see who is winning    :
   :               but you cannot take command after the fighting has         :
   :               started.         To adjust the amount of time between an   :
   :               encounter and the start of a battle, go to "Ye Olde        :
   :               Options Shoppe." With "fight delay" set to medium, you     :
   :               have about 30 seconds between an encounter and the start   :
   :               of a battle.                                               :

   :               Most rules apply to both you and the enemy, although some  :
   :               may be different for the enemy depending on who their      :
   :               leader is.                                                 :
   :                                                                          :
   :  SIGHTINGS: When one of your squadrons gets close to an enemy squadron,  :
   :               it will report sighting the enemy.  When the visibility is :
   :               not set to unlimited, the squadron that is sighted will    :
   :               appear on the map.  It will stay on the map until your     :
   :               squadron loses sight of it.  The "rules" determine the     :
   :               visibility.  If a sighting is reported and you can't find  :
   :               an enemy squadron in that area, it is because your men     :
   :               lost sight of it quickly.  After sighting an enemy         :
   :               squadron, you can trail it, try to run from it or close in :
   :               to fight.                                                  :
   :                                                                          :
   :  SUPPLY                                                                  :
   :      PORT:  A supply port will provide supplies to any ship anchored in  :
   :               its harbor.  When a port receives supplies, it will        :
   :               gradually transfer them to any ships in port.  Naturally,  :
   :               it will take longer to receive supplies in a crowded port. :
   :               When a port runs out of supplies it will change colors and :
   :               you will here a tone.                                      :
   :                                                                          :
   :  SURRENDER: When surrender is on the command line, you can surrender to  :
   :               the enemy Admiral by pressing S.                           :
   :                                                                          :
   :                                                                          :
   :  TIME    :  The time option controls the speed of the game.  Time can be :
   :               varied during the game at your discrection.  During Zoom   :
   :               the time setting uses a variable time speed.  If all the   :
   :               ships in the battle are slowed down because of wind,       :
   :               damage or other factors, time will speed up to a superfast :
   :               rate.  This speeds up the pace of the game during slow     :
   :               periods.                                                   :
   :                                                                          :
   :  ZOOM    :  After one of your squadrons reports an Encounter, and before :
   :               they report a Battle, you can Zoom down to the scene of    :
   :               the battle and take command of the individual ships.  To   :
   :               Zoom, place the marker over one of the squadrons in the    :
   :               encounter and press Z.  The amount of time between an      :
   :               Encounter and a Battle can be adjusted in Ye Olde Options  :
   :               Shoppe.   If you don't Zoom in time, the squadrons will    :
   :               begin fighting one their own, and you won't be able to     :
   :               Zoom into that battle.                                     :
