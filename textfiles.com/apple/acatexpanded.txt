        The Apple Cat // modem is by far the most expandable modem on the
market today. Of course it's also the choice modem of pirates because of it's
inexpensive half-duplex 1200 baud capabilities. The expansion module available
for the cat has several very useful functions. Rather than shelling out $30
bucks for one which you may only use a few of the features this file tells you
how to build just certain features or even the whole package.
        First off you'll need some basic knowledge and tools. As for the
knowledge you'll need to know how to solder pretty well, you'll also proabibly
have to know DC from Hz and +12V from RS232. Ok now, If you can handle that
that, you'll need these tools:
- A soldering iron and solder
- A flat, 14 wire, female cable. Preferably multi-colored.
    * Note: Single strands of wire will do but they risk damaging your cat.
        We'll be connecting the wires to the J2 connector (see owner's manual,
fig. 2). Remember that there are 25 pins on this connector. Each pin numbered
starting with pin 1 in the rear of your computer and pin 25 closest to the
keyboard. We'll only be working with the first 14 pins. The rest are for the
212 and speech synthesizer cards.
        Here is a table which tells something about each pin:
Pin # |     Function             | Direction |          Feature
------|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------
  01  | Transmit Data            |   Output  | EIA-RS232C Printer interface
  02  | Receive Data             |   Input   |
  03  | Clear to Send Signal     |   Input   |
  04  | Signal Ground            |    GND    |
------|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------
  05  | AC line reference (60Hz) |   Input   | BSR Remote control
  06  | Signal Ground            |    GND    |
  08  | +12V DC                  |   Output  |
  09  | 120 KHz Control Signal   |   Output  |
------|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------
  07  | +12V DC                  |   Output  | Off-Hook LED
  12  | LED Drive                |   Output  |
------|--------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------
  10  | Tape Recorder Control    |   Input   | Tape Recorder
  11  | Tape Recorder Control    |   Output  |
  12  | Audio Signal to Tape     |   Output  |
  14  | Signal Ground            |    GND    |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Note: This table corrects several errors which occur in the table in the
Owner's Manual.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bulidin` the On/Off hook indicator
==================================
Required parts: 12V DC LED
==================================
        This is the most inexpensive and simple of the projects. All you must
do is connect the wire leading from pin 7 to the positive pole of the LED and
connect pin 12 to the remaining pole. Solder connections firmly and whenever
the modem is off-hook the LED will light.
Hooking up a tape player
========================
Required parts: Tape Recorder with adjustable record level, 3.5 mm patch cable;
male on one end; stripped on the other, Patch cable with 2.5 mm plug on one
end;stripped on the other.
========================
        This is proabibly the most useful feature. With this feature you may
listen in on your cat. Such as when calling a board you'll never have to pick
up the phone. You also might want to do an answering machine. I'll tell you
more about that later.
        To build this you must take the wires leading from pins 10 & 11 and
connect them to the stripped ends of your 2.5 mm patch cable. Now take the
wires leading from pins 13 & 14 and connect them to the stripped ends of your
3.5 mm patch cable. ** Note: You may have to reverse which pin goes to which
wire on each cable if it doesn't work at first. Now, simply plug the 3.5 mm
plug into the Mic jack on the tape recorder and plug the 2.5 mm plug into the
Rem jack on the tape recorder.
        To use this you just press the Rec button(s) on your tape recorder. On
most tape recorder you'll be able to hear what is going on when the modem picks
up the phone. You'll notice that the tape does not move when you press record,
you must do a POKE 49313,31 (Default = 0) to turn on the tape. That is how you
make your answering machine. ** Note: I have included an answering machine
program at the end of his file.
Bulidin` the EIA-RS232C printer interface
=========================================
Required parts: Serial printer, RS232C cable
=========================================
        This is pretty difficult to explain. We'll start by looking at the
RS232C port on the back of your printer. This port has two rows of holes. One
row has 12 holes and the other has 13. We'll number these holes by going left
to right the first holes are 1 to 13 on the largest row, next go to the left of
the smaller row and number from 14 to 25. Not all of these holes will be used.
This chart tells which wire goes to which hole:
Pin # | Hole(s)
------|--------
  01  |   12
  02  |   11
  03  |  19+3 (19 first)
  04  |   07
---------------
Hooking up the BSR Remote Transformer
=====================================
Required Parts: BSR Remote Transformer
=====================================
        ** Note: This is really quite dangerous and I recommend if you wish to
use this function and are unsure of your abilities that you buy an expansion
module.
                Now, look at the square end of your transformer. Each hole
should have a number next to it. If you don't see these numbers than just
number counter-clockwise starting at the bottom left corner (notch facing the
floor). There is really no good way to get the wires to stay in these holes.
You may want to go to Radio Shack and look for something. Anyways be sure the
transformer is not plugged into the wall and connect each pin to each hole as
shown:
Pin #5--> Hole #3
Pin #6--> Hole #1
Pin #8--> Hole #2
Pin #9--> Hole #4
**Caution: Be sure that no wire touches another wire!
        To use this you must have at least one of those modules which come with
the real BSR Command things. There is a program on your Com-Ware disk to
control this.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Caution: When working on these features be sure to connect them to the pins
last or else damage to you or your cat may occur.
