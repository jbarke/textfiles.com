   From: DR.ATOMIC

Heres one that a friend and i created
and it turned out quite good to!

First you begin with one beer making
kit( usually makes 25gallons ) then
make
sure that you have the other brew
making equipment (silly if ya didn't)
then
have 1 to 2 lbs. of mushrooms, locals
are better cause there cheeper (free)
if ya go get them yourselves. Grind
mushrooms to a pulp while there still
wet
, then make beer by the book. Add your
mushrooms to the mixed beer and stir
well
 then bottle in 25 gallon fermentation
jug till beer is ready for bottleing
 Bottle this concoction by way of
siphoning into them. Let the bottled
beer sit
until ready then take a taste. If it's
ready break out the glasses and invite
a friend or two over and have a ball!

If ya do it right it's garanted to make
a howlingly wild night.

back to the beakers,
                           The  Dr.
