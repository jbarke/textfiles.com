Some Natural Drugs, Poisons And Their Sources

Written by Lazurus Long.

     Many of the sources of drugs are or were originally natural.  The
extraction of some of these is easy, for others it is a more complicated
process.  This article is the first in a series.  In this part some of the
solvents required will be detailed.  The easiest way of obtaining these
solvents is to go and get them from a chemical supplier.  However this may
not be practical for all the readers of this article so I will detail methods
of preparing them fairly safely...

     The first solvent that you will need is chloroform (Trichloromethane).
This is very easy to prepare but it requires care.  You should remember that
chloroform is a knockout gas.  This can be exploited.  A few parts per
hundred in the air has interesting effects as the concentration rises sleep
follows, if you are not careful death follows so be careful.

     The ingredients for this recipe are;
     Acetone (Propanone) Nail varnish remover
     Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) 

     The concentrations of the solutions will probably need to be adjusted.  
The bleach must be converted to 2M.  This means that 2 * Molecular Wt in 1 
litre of water.  To do this dry the bleach by evapouration and redissolve in
water.  (The Mol Wt of sodium hypo is 74.5g) The solution is also used in
photography and can be obtained from camara supply shops.  You need 120ml of
sodium hypo so you need 17.8g in 120ml of water. The acetone concentration
should be about right.

     So into the distillation flask put 3ml of acetone and 120ml of the 
sodium hypo, shake it, allow it to stand for a couple of mins then distill as
shown below.





               __
             _/ _\
            /  / \\ <- b
            | |   \\
            / \    \\
       a ->|__|     \\
                   /   \
                   |___| <- c


     Place the chemicals in a ( the flask) this should be cloudy.  
Distill the mix gently until the oily chloroform starts to appear in the
condenser (b) continue until no more oily drops appear.  The mixture in
c should be reasonably pure chloroform.  The lower heavy layer should be
kept for use. In this experiment. 


     The Extraction of Caffeine an Alkaloid from Tea 

     Caffeine is an alkaloid.  This is a stimulant.  It is easy to extract
from tea bags.

     You need the chloroform, 20 tea bags, hot water and filtration
apparatus.

     Boil the 20 tea bags for about 20 mins in water.  Very strong tea!  Pour 
this liquid through a muslin filter to remove any tea leaves.  Squeeze the 
liquid out of the bags.  Don't use fingers for this unless you want to stain 
your hands for a while!  Put the liquid into a large clear jar.  Pour in 
slowly the chloroform into the jar.  Swirl this liquid very gently for about 
5 mins.  Don't be violent or an emulsion will form that is difficult to break
up and you will have to start again.

     The clear layer at the base of the flask must now be removed.  Use a 
pippete to transfer as much as possible of the clear liquid into a small 
beaker.  This liquid must be evapourated carefully.  DO NOT USE ANY FORM OF 
NAKED FLAME AS THE VAPOUR IS HIGHLY INFLAMMABLE.

     The white solid left is pure caffeine.  This is a stimulant but be 
careful as too much is harmful.




     Now for the second solvent.

     This is the gas that used to be used to put patients to sleep before
operations, Ether.

     This is another easy solvent to make.  Again the greatest danger is from 
fire.  You need reasonably pure alcohol.  Distilled vodka is as good as any
if you can't get hold of any other.

     You now need a source of concentrated sulphuric acid.  From a car
battery.

     Put 10ml ethanol in a flask add 8ml of sulphuric acid slowly to the 
contents.  The flask should be kept as cold as possible preferably in ice.  
Distill as above at a temp of 140 degrees.  The vapour coming off is very 
explosive so keep the collecter vessel as cold as possible.  The ether in the 
vessel is very useful as a solvent and as a knockout gas.  Small amounts 
cause laughter and a feeling of happiness larger amounts render you
insensitive to pain and put you to sleep.  Too much puts you into a very deep
sleep ocassionally called death.

The poison in this article is one of the easiest to use.  No apparatus is 
required simply feed the recipient any part of the henbane plant and watch
them suffer.  All the parts of this plant are packed with poison so any part
will do!
