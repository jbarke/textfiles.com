Do yoy wanna make PCP(Angel Dust)? The following formulas A,B and C
tells you how. Formula D is for a related compound with similar effects.
The substances give an eufforic effect by an oral dosage of 5 to 10mg.
The formulas produce the free base of the compounds, but for human use
the salt is preferred. To convert the free base to its corresponding salt
just dissolve it in isopropanolic hydrogenchloride and precipitate the
salt by addition of ether. Another way is to dissolve the free base in
ether and adding an excess of hydrogenchloride to precipitate the salt.
The 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine hydrogenchloride salt melts at 243-
244 degrees C. The hydrogenchloride salt of formula D melts at 236-
237 degrees C.

                                A
 A solution containing one mole of magnesium bromide etherate
(prepared by reacting 25g of magnesium with 188g of ethylenedibromide
in 400ml of ether) is added to a solution of phenyl lithium prepared
from 13.9g of lithium and 160g of bromobenzene in 500ml of anhydrous
ether. The resulting mixture is refluxed with stirring for several
hours and then a solution of 154g of 1-(1-piperidino)-cyclohexane-
carbonitrile in 500ml of dry ether added. The reaction mixture is
refluxed and stirred for 18 hours and then treated with sufficient
satureded ammoniumchloride solution to just produce a clear ether
layer. After filtration of the solids the ether is distilled and
the residual 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine so obtained
distilled in vacou; b.p 109 degrees at 0.25mm. On rubbing and
stirring the oily distillate the product crystallizes. After
recrystallization from ligroin the PCP melts at 45-46 degrees.

                                 B
 A mixture consisting of 170g of piperidine, 220g of cyclohexanone
and 750ml of benzene is subjected to azeotropic distillation until
the the evolution of water ceases. The solution is subjected to vacuum
distillation to obtain the desired N-(1-cyclohexenyl)piperidine; b.p.
105 degrees at 8mm.
 190g of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate is suspended in 250ml toluene
and the mixture heated under a water trap until all the water has been
removed. 165g of N-(1-cyclohexenyl)piperidine in 500ml of ether is added 
to the toluene solution of p-toluenesulfonic acid at about 0-5 degrees.
A solution of approximately one mole of phenyl magnesium bromide
(prepared from 157g of bromobenzene and 24g of magnesium) in 750ml 
of ether is added to the slurry of the tosylate salt of N-(1-cyclohexenyl)-
piperidine with stirring at about 5 degrees. The reaction mixture is stirred
for 30 minutes after the addition has been completed and decomposed by the
addition of an excess of saturated ammonium chloride and koncentrated
ammonium hydroxide. The ether layer is removed, dried over potassium 
carbonate and the ether destilled. Distillation of the residue in vacuo
yields the desired 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine; b.p. 135-137 degrees
at 1mm; m.p. 46-46.5 degrees.

                                 C
 59g of magnesium is added to 230g of 1,5-dibromopentane in 2 liters of
ether and the mixture stirred and refluxed for three hours. 151g of
N-benzoylpiperidine is added to the solution of pentamethylene-bis-
magnesiumbromide and the ether removed by distillation untill the 
temperature in the reaction vessel reaches about 83 degrees C. The 
reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for sixteen hours,
cooled and then treated with sufficient ammoniumhydroxide and sauterated
ammoniumchloride to dissolve all the precipitate. The solution is diluted
with 2 liters of ether and the ether layer removed by decantation.
The ether layer is washed, dried over sodiumhydroxide and then the
ether distilled. The residue is distilled in vacuo to obtain the
desired 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine; bp 128-134 degrees C. at
0.8mm Hg.

                                 D
 A mixture consisting of 100g of anhydrous ethylamine and 220g of
cyclohexanone is allowed to stand for 16 hours. The reaction mixture
is shaken thoroughly with solid potassiumhydroxide and the oil layer
removed by decantation. Distillation of the oil layer in vacou yields
the desired N-cyclohexylidene ethylamine; bp 68-75 degrees C. at 22mm Hg.
A solution of phenyllithium prepared from 11.2g of lithium and 76ml of
bromobenzene in 500ml of ether is added dropwise at 0 degrees C. to 
a solution of 51g of N-cyclohexylidene ethylamine in 500ml of ether.
After the addition has been completed, the reaction mixture is stirred
for one hour and then decomposed by the addition of water. The ether
layer is removed, washed with water and dried. The ether is evaporated
and the residue distilled in vacuo to obtain the desired
(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-ethylamine; bp 104-108 degrees C. at 2.5mm Hg.
