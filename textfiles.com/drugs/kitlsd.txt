LSD In The Kitchen! Somthing To Do For Those People That Like To Stay Home
and Be Sick!

First of All, All we're doing is extracting the lysergic acid amides
either from morning glory (Yeah! Those things your mom's growing in the
front yeard!) or Hawaiian wood rose seeds...Prepared in the kitchen...

1) Grind up 150 grams of morning glory seeds or baby hawaiian wood rose seeds.

2) In 130 cc. of petroleum ether soak the seeds for two days.

3) Filter the Solution through a tight screen.

4) Throw away the liquid and let the seed mush dry.

5) For two days allow the seed mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood alchohol.

6) Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and labeling it "1".

7) Resoak the mush in 110 cc. of wood alcohol for two days

8) Filter and throw away mush.

9) Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled "1".

10) Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow to evaporate.

11) When all the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum remains. This should be
    scraped up into capsules.

        30 Grams Of Morning Glory Seeds = One Trip
      15 Grams Hawaiian Wood Rose Seeds = One Trip

many companies coat their seeds in toxic chemicals, it is best to buy them
from a wholesaler...Like My Friend Chong-
