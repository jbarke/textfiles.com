   The most amazing thing about hashish is the price on the black market. An ounce of hash usually slls for anywhere between $60 and $100 (old book). I say the price is amazing because with one kilo (.2 lbs) of grass, a person can easily make seven or eight ounces of hash.In other words, you can bascly increase your money sharply br doing this.

   The process for extracting the essence of marijuana is a simple one, but it requires the utmost cre. You need a kilo of grass to begin with (woohh), and a screen to sift it through.

1) A kilo of grass usually comes in a block, compressed together, so break         down the block an gently put it through the screen.   

2) Remove all dirt and foreign objects, but don't take out the stems. The seeds    should also be taen out, as they are much to greasy for good hash.

3) Now that you have seperated the kilo and sifted it, place it in a large pot     and cover with rubing alcohol (about one and a half gallons per kilo).                                             
4) Now boil the mixture for about three hours. Be sure to use a hot plate or       electric stove raher than gas as alcohol is highly inflammable and should      never be exposed to a naked flame.

5) After three hours, strain liquids out of the pot, and store in a plastic
   container labeled "Solution 1." Now take the mush you have left and repeat
   the boiling with fresh alcohol for another three hours.

6) After two alcohol extractions, each time using fresh alcohol, follow the        same procedure, bt substitue water for alcohol. The water must be boiled       at a higher temperature than the alcohl, but only for an hour. This boiling
   procedure with water should be performed twice.

7) Once these procedures have been performed, strain off the liquids again
   and store in another container, and label "Solution 2". Now reduce volumes      of both solutionsby boiling in seperate pots, turn down the heat as each 
   solution begins to thicken.

8) When each solution is reasonably thickened, combine them and boil a little 
   more on the hot plate. At this point the solution should have the    consistency of modeling clay

9) Now heat a cupful of terpentine, and add to the mush. Be extra careful with
   the terpentine, as even the vapors are inflammable. Add 2 ozs. of pine
   resin and stir pot for ten minutes, under low heat.

10) Now pour mush into a baking tin, two or three inches deep, and heat in the
    oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. After this, you should have some really
    good hash but, if the hash doesn't dry up after this step, just leave it in
    the oven a few more minutes or until it dries out.           
  
* Hash can be smoked either in a pipe or with tobbaco in a cigarette.   Traditionally, hash is smoke in a hookah or water pipe. But it's your 
  choice...  Have fun!
