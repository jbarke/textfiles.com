Several sources have been used and may be requested from above.

(*@/// Phenylalanine *)
(*@/// L-phenylalanine *)
L-phenylalanine
	- converted into tyrosine which is
	   precursor to noradrenaline (NE) and dopamine
	- like all amino acids best taken on empty stomach since it competes
	  with proteins to cross the blood brain barrier.
	- requires vitamins C and B-6 for the conversion to NE.
	- Dosage: 500 - 1000mg along with 1g C, 30-50mg B-6
	- phenylalanine also stimulates the release of
	  cholecystokinin, which is the body's own appetite-suppressant,
	- can increase sexual interest
	- improves memory and mental alertness
	- antidepressant
	- do not use L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine if you are
	  using MAO inhibitors for depression (it can cause a
	  major elevation in blood pressure).
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// DL-phenylalanine *)
DL-phenylalanine
	  - combination of synthetic (D) and natural (L) phenylalanine
	  - produces endorphins and stimulates their use
	  - thus, effective painkiller, often better than the
	    opiate derivatives such as morphine.
	  - nonaddictive, nontoxic
	  - reverse-tolerance effect (pain relief gets better)
	  - strong anti-depressant effect
	  - can be combined with other pain-killers
	    with few bad interactions
(*@\\\*)
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Tyrosine *)
L-tyrosine
	- precursor to norepinephrine and dopamine
	- non-essential amino acid (since PA is converted into it first)
	- has been studied as an effective aid to cocaine withdrawal
	- (see L-phenylalanine)
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Tryptophan *)
L-tryptophan
	- precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin along with
	  B6, niacin, and magnesium.
	- (actually immediate precursor to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP)
	   which is the precursor to serotonin (5HT))
	- prolongs slow-wave sleep
	- reduces pain sensitivity
	- no effect or increases REMS
	- has some hypnotic effects
	- useful for some types of endogenous depression
	  (has been found as useful as imipramine and amitriptyline)
	- aids in reducing anxiety and tension
	- an appetite supressant
	- dosages have been studied up to 15g
	- Major Food Sources:
	      Cottage cheese, milk, meat, fish, turkey, bananas,
	      dried dates, peanuts, all protein-rich foods.
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Lysine *)

L-lysine
	- needed for growth and enzyme, hormone, antibody production
	- aids concentration
	- treatment for some sterility problems
	- treatment and prevention for herpes infections
	- aids fatty acid -> energy conversion
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Arginine *)
L-arginine
	- used to increase sperm counts
	  (semen contains up to 80% of arginine)
	- aids immune response and healing of wounds
	- helps stored fat metabolism
	- helps to tone muscle tissue
	- used for weight-loss in combination with L-ornithine
	- one amino acid required for production of growth hormone
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Ornithine *)
L-ornithine
	- similar to arginine
	- growth hormone (which acts as a fat metabolizer) is
	  stimulated to be released by ornithine and arginine.
	- can be used as a slimming technique (while you sleep -
	  GH is released by the pituitary gland then)
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Glutamine *)

L-glutamine
	- converted to glutamic acid, the brain's emergency source of
	  energy when glucose is in short supply.
	- precursor to the neurotransmitter GABA
	- neutralizes excess ammonia (which can inhibit proper
	  brain function)
	- improves intelligence
	- helps to control alcoholism
	- helps to speed ulcer healing
	- alleviates fatigue, depression, impotence,
	  schizophrenia, senility
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Aspartic Acid *)
L-aspartic acid
	- ammonia neutralizer
	- a study showed improved stamina and endurance in atheletes
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Cysteine *)

L-cysteine
	- cystine is its stable form
	- antioxidant
	- contains sulfur
	- protects cellular membranes from "free radical damage"
	- prevents alcohol and cigarette smoke damage to the brain
	- stimulant to immune system
	- believed to be good for antiaging
	- effective against copper toxicity (eg. Wilson's disease)
	- protects against X-ray and nuclear radiation
	- warning: may affect insulin effectiveness
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Methionine *)
L-methionine
	- antioxidant
	- contains sulfur
	- prevents damage of brain cells from toxic heavy metals
	- important in producing neurotransmitters and energy
	- lowers blood level of histamine
	  (this may help some types of schizophrenia)
	- combined with choline and folic acid, can prevent some
	  types of tumors
	- deficiencies: hair loss, atherosclerosis, cholestorol deposits,
	  edema, poor urine processing
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Glycine *)
L-glycine
	- treatment for poor pituitary functioning
	- supplies creatine which is essential for muscle function
	  (effective against muscular dystrophy)
	- treatment for hypoglycemia
	- stimulates glucagon which metabolizes glycogen into glucose
	- antacid
	- treatment for low blood pH
	- treatment for leucine imbalance-causing body odor and halitosis
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Leucine *)
L-taurine
	- nonessential amino acid
	- aids efficient conduction of electrical impulses
	  along nerve pathways
	- anticonvulsant (esp in combo with glutamic, aspartic acids)
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Glutathione *)
L-Glutathione
      - tripeptide amino acid made of cysteine, glutamic acid and glycine
      - "triple threat" antiaging
      - antioxidant
      - anti-tumor agent
      - respiratory accelerator in the brain
      - used in the treatment of: allergies, cataracts, diabetes,
	hypoglycemia, arthritis
      - prevents some side effects of chemotherapy and X-ray radiation
      - protects against some harmful side-effects of cigarrette smoke
	and alcohol
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Carnatine *)
L-carnatine
      - newly discovered amino acid
      - aids stored fat -> energy conversion
      - helps: hypoglycemia, reduces angina attacks, diabetes,
	liver disease, kidney disease
      - deficiency causes heart tissue damage
