Straight from the Anarchist's Cookbook:
 
      EXTRACTING MESCALINE FROM PEYOTE IN THE KITCHEN
 
1. Obtain 50g of dried ground peyote and put in a 500 ml
Erlenmeyer flask.
 
2. Add 250cc of wood alcohol, cover the flask tightly, and
let cactus powder oak it up for one day, with occasional
stirring. 
  
3. Pour off the wood-alcohol solution into a 500 ml beaker,
filter properly, and place in a well ventilated place to
evaporate.
 
4. Again soak the plant powder in the flask fo two hours,
but in 100cc of 1- normal hydrochloric acid.
 
5. Filter, discard the mush, and combine the filtered HCL
solution with the residue from the evaporated wood alcohol
solution. Filter again.
 
6. To the solution add enough 2-normal potassium
hydroxide until the solution is normal.(Turns pH paper
beige.)
 
7. Add 100cc of chloroform, stir, and let the mixture stand
until it separates into two layers,
 
8. Separate the two layers, using a separatory funnel and
discard the water(top) layer.
 
9. Add 40 cc. of water to the chloroform, shake, and
separate the layers again, Discard the top layer.
 
10. Filter the chloroform, evaporate, and dissolve the
gummy residue in 20cc of wate. Refilter it. Makes about one
dose.
 
CAUTION: Although this method is suppose to reduce the foul
taste and smell of peyote, it still might make you
nauseated. Vomit, puke, etc., but you'll get VERY stoned.
The nausea will pass.
