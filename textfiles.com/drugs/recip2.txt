     In the second part of this series we will be talking about Herbalism. 
Herbalism is the use of herbs for medicinal purposes. It is very long and 
involved so we wont go into extreme depth.
 
     First I will show you how to make some simple brews.
 
          For a cough that's really pissing you off:
 
Ipecacuan syrup- 1oz
Sassafras (bruised)- 1oz                Boil the whole thing for
Aniseed- 2oz                            30 minutes then add 1 pint
Honey- 4oz                              spirits of wine
American Valerian- 2oz
Black Oats- 2oz                         Dose: 1/2 wineglassfull when
Water- 2 quarts                               the cough is at its worst
 
 
          Here's one I know some of you will like:
               A sexual invigorator:
 
False unicorn- 1/2 oz                            Mix well.
Tincture of St. John's Wort- 1/2 oz              Dose: 30-60 drops
Tincture of Damiana- 1/2 oz                            every 6 hours
 
 
Note: do not make ANY of these in an aluminium bowl, instead use copper or
 pyrex. Also if no preserving agent is used such as honey or brandy then
       if it turns cloudy. DONT use it.
 
          If you want to cleanse your blood:
 
Sasparilla Bruised Decoction:                  Simmer for 30 minutes
     Bruised Honduras Sasaparilla- 2oz         Sweeten with honey
     Boiling water- 1 qt                       Dose: 1 gill(1/4pt) 3x daily
 
 
   Now you have learned a little about what kind of brews witches, real 
witches that is, prepare. In fact witches never cooked up evil brews in their 
kettles all of that hooplah cam from the naming of the different herbs in 
english from the latin form of the word. I'll illustrate it in this short chart:
 
 
Wiccan Name               Common Name              Latin Name
------------------------- ------------------------ --------------------------
Addler's Mouth            Stich Wort               Stellaria media
Bird's Eye                False Hellebore          Helleborus foetious
Flesh and Blood           Tormentil                Potentilla tormentilla
Lizard's Tail             Breast Weed              Saururus cernuus
Negro Head                Vegatable Ivory          Phytelephas macrocarpa
Snake's Tongue            Addler's Tongue Fern     Ophioglossum vulgatum
Swine Snout               Dandelion                Taraxacum dens leonis
Unicorn's Horn            False Unicorn            Helgonias dioica
 
 
     I'm sure you can see how people might have been slightly intimidated by
 these names. That is all myth though.
 
     Now for our final concoction i'll show you how to cool down in the heat 
of the sommer:
 
Rasperries- 1 1/2 oz
Licorice Root(chopped or powdered)- 1/2 oz
Water- 1 1/2 pt
 
Bring to a boil on medium, then simmer on low for 20 minutes.
Strain through cheese cloth. Sweeten with honey while hot then pour over ice.
Makes 3 servings with out ice 6-8 with ice.
 
The two ingrediants really have a property which causes the body to produce 
less heat the ices just cools down the dirnk.
