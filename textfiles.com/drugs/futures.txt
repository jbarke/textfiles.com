'You are what you eat', as the old saying goes, has more truth
in it than most of us would like to admit.  The reality is, at
the moleculer level, the quality and quantity of all cognitive
functions is entirely dependent upon the availability of a rich
assortment of specific molecules in the food and food supplements
we eat.

With today's advanced understanding of the molecular biology 
involved in the human brain and centarl nervous system, researchers
have developed easy ways for anyone to not only experience an 
increase in their cognitive functions, but to also repair the
damage caused by aging, smoking, drinking, and exposure to other 
toxic substances in the environment.
