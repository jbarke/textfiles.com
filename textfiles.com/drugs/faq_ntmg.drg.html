+ ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA, Part VII Micropedia:
 
  nutmeg, spice consisting of the seed of the Myristica fragrans,
  a tropical, dioecious evergreen tree native to the Moluccas
  or Spice Islands of Indonesia. Nutmeg has a characteristic,
  pleasant fragrance and slightly warm taste; it is used to
  flavour many kinds of baked goods, confections, puddings,
  meats, sausages, sauces, vegetables, and such beverages as
  eggnog. Grated nutmeg has been used as a sachet; the Romans
  used it as incense.
  Around 1600 it became important as an expensive commercial
  spice of the Western world and was subject of Dutch plots
  to keep prices high and of English and French counterplots
  to obtain fertile seeds for transplantation. The nutmegs
  sold whole were dipped in lime to prevent their growth.
    The tree is cultivated in the Moluccas and the West Indies
  principally, and elsewhere with varying success. The trees
  may reach about 65 feet (20 metres) tall. They yield fruit
  8 years after sowing, reach their prime in 25 years, and bear
  fruit for 60 years or longer. The stands on the Moluccas
  thrive in the shade under groves of lofty trees. The nutmeg
  fruit is a pendulous drupe, similar in appearance to an apricot.
  When fully mature it splits in two, exposing a crimson-coloured
  aril, the mace, surrounding a single shiny,
  brown seed, the nutmeg. The pulp of the fruit may be eaten
  locally. After collection, the aril-enveloped nutmegs are
  conveyed to curing areas where the mace is removed, flattened
  out, and dried. The nutmegs are dried gradually in the sun and
  turned twice daily over a period of six to eight weeks. During
  this time the nutmeg shrinks away from its hard seed coat
  until the kernels rattle in their shells when shaken. The
  shell is then broken with a wooden truncheon and the nutmegs
  are picked out. Dried nutmegs are grayish-brown ovals with
  furrowed surfaces. Large ones may be about 1.2 inches long
  and 0.8 inch in diameter.
    Nutmeg and mace contain 7 to 14 percent essential oil,
  the principal components of which are pinene,
  camphene, and dipentene, all having the empirical formula
  C10H16. Nutmeg on expression yields about 24 to 30 percent
  fixed oil called nutmeg butter, or oil of mace, the principal
  component of which is trimyristin, C45H86O6. The oils are
  used as condiments and carminatives and to scent soaps and
  perfumes. An ointment of nutmeg butter has been used as a
  counterirritant and in treatment of rheumatism.
    The name nutmeg is also applied in different countries
  to other fruits or seeds: the Jamaica, or calabash, nutmeg
  derived from Monodora myristica; the Brazilian nutmeg from
  Cryptocarya moschata; the Peruvian nutmeg from Laurelia
  aromatica; the Madagaskar, or clove, nutmeg from Ravensara
  aromatica; and the California, or stinking, nutmeg from
  Torreya californica.

+ MACMILLAN DICTIONARY OF TOXICOLOGY:
 
  myristicin
    A naturally occurring methylenedioxyphenyl compound found in
    nutmeg. It has been suggested that myristicin may be
    responsible, in whole or in part, for the toxicity of nutmeg.
    The spice (5-15g) causes symptoms similar to atropine
    poisoning: flushing of skin, tachycardia, absence of
    salivation, and excitation of the central nervous system.
    Euphoria and hallucinations have given rise to abuse of this
    material. As a methylenedioxyphenyl compound, myristicin
    gives rise to a type III spectrum with reduced cytochrome
    P-450 and can inhibit monooxygenations catalyzed by this
    cytochrome. See also AMPHETAMINES; CYTOCHROME P-450, OPTICAL

  Adverse Effects
  Nutmeg, taken in large doses may cause nausea and vomiting,
  flushing, dry mouth, tachycardia, stimulation of the central
  nervous system possibly with epileptiform convulsions, miosis,
  mydriasis, euphoria, and hallucinations.
 
  Within 4 hours of taking 28 g of nutmeg in water and orange
  juice, a 19-year-old woman felt cold and shivery. This was
  followed after 6 to 8 hours by severe vomiting accompanied by
  hallucinations. For a week she had poor concentration and was
  disorientated. The hallucinogen in nutmeg was believed to be
  myristicin. - D. J. Panayotopoulos and D. D. Chisholm (letter),
  Br. med. J., 1970, 1, 754. A similar report. - R. A. Faguet
  and K. F. Rowland, Am. J. Psychiat., 1978, 135, 860.
  Within 3 days of receiving ground nutmeg 9 teaspoonfuls daily
  to control the diarrhoea associated with nodullary carcinoma
  of the thyroid, a patient complained of dry eyes and mouth,
  blurred vision, dizziness, tingling, and feelings of
  depersonalisation and remoteness. The symptoms gradually
  subsided as the dose was reduced. - G. S. Venables et al.
  (letter), Br. med. J., 1976, I, 96.
  Ingestion of freshly ground nutmeg 1.5 to 4 g three to four
  times daily for 2 days by 2 subjects produced constipation,
  but no aspirin-like effect on biphasic platelet aggregation
  was noted. Both subjects also felt light-headed, slightly
  disorientated, occassionally nauseated, flushed, and had
  nasal congestion and very dry mouths; pupil size was
  unaffected. - W. H. Dietz and M. J. Stuart (letter),
  New Engl. J. Med., 1976, 294, 503.
 
  Uses and Administration
  Nutmeg and nutmeg oil are aromatic and carminative and are
  used as flavouring agents. Nutmeg oil and expressed nutmeg oil,
  a solid fat, are rubefacient. Nutmeg is reported to inhibit
  prostaglandin synthesis.

     Hallucinogenic Effect of Nutmeg
 
  Sir, - A patient tells us it is common knowledge among the
  drug-taking and hippie sub-culture that taking nutmeg is a
  potent way of taking a "trip". The hallucinogen in nutmeg
  is believed to be myristicin.
    An intelligent 19-year-old female with a hysterical
  personality took one ounce of nutmeg in water and orange
  juice. She had five fays previously taken L.S.D. with very
  little effect. She had also experimented with cannabis, but the
  only noticeable effect of this was that she developed a dry
  mouth. In contrast to this the effects of nutmeg were marked.
  At first she felt no effect, but after four hours she felt
  cold and shivery. Six to eight hours later she was vomiting
  severely. She saw faces and the room appeared distorted, with
  flashing lights and loud music. She felt a different person
  and everything seemed unreal. Time appeared to stand still.
  She felt vibrations and twitches in her limbs. When she shut
  her eyes she saw lights, black creatures, red eyes and felt
  sucked into the ground. Her mood was one of elation. She
  was taken by her friends to be seen by one of us (D.P.) as an
  emergency. She was admitted and quickly fell into a sound sleep.
  For the next week, however, she felt that she was walking in
  a cloud and complained that her thinking was confused and she
  found it difficult to follow what people were saying. Her
  concentration seemed poor and lapses of attention were noticed.
    The clinical features of this case have much in common with
  the effects of nutmeg ingestion previously reported (1). The
  physical symptoms were unpleasant, and the girl states that
  she would not take nutmeg again because of these. In her case
  vomiting was the most severe physical side-effect. Severe
  physical collapse following ingestion of nutmeg occurs (2).
  A dose of 10-15 g. however is required before acute intoxication
  occurs (3). Despite the side-effects, however, it is probable
  that with the increased drug-taking among young people more cases
  of nutmeg intoxication will come to medical attention.

  The household spice, nutmeg, has been known to have psychotropic
  effects. These have been described in varying details by a
  number of reports in the literature. Even authors who do not
  accord them much prominence, such as Payne, (1) do mention them.
  It is generally assumed that the active psychotropic substance
  is myristicin. The inability to imitate nutmeg intoxication
  with synthetic myristicin has given rise to speculation that
  other substances of the volatile oil obtained from the nutmeg
  seed, Myristica fragrans, may also be factors. (2)
    Weiss (3) has reported in detail the psychic experiences
  of adult prison inmates following the ingestion of powdered
  nutmeg. Nutmeg has been mentioned as one of the substances now
  prominent in illegal or quasi-legal use among adolescents. (4)
  There are no detailed reports about the use of this substance
  by adolescents.
 
  Case report
 
    The following is an account of the experiences of an
  eighteen-year-old student who ingested half a can (one fourth
  of a teacup) of commercially available nutmeg. His girl friend
  who was present throughout this experience did not partake of
  the nutmeg. He had taken marihuana on several occassions before
  that and had experienced vivid imagery under its influence.
  About two weeks had elapsed between the last time he had taken
  marihuana and the time he took nutmeg. The latter substance
  was taken partly out of curiosity (he had heard about its
  effect "by the grapevine"), but mainly because marihuana was
  not then available. Fifteen to twenty minutes after taking
  nutmeg, a teaspoon at a time, and flushing it down with
  Coca Cola, "things went funny." He felt "as if he had stayed
  awake for two days without sleeping" and "things started to
  look unreal" to him. His head shook back and forth, and when
  somebody said something to him, he could not see the connections
  between the sentences. He said he remembered that he "spoke up
  and nobody understood him" either.

    About one and a half hours after the ingestion, he started
  feeling "as though he had drunk fifty cups of coffee." He
  "could not stop shaking," he "was giggling," he "was saying
  stupid things," things he would not have said otherwise. His
  friend became aware of the change in him.  The patient
  remembered she asked him whether or not he felt all right.
  "Peoples' voices appeared to come out of a porthole above my
  head." He "felt a tingling" in his hands, and presently his
  "whole body felt numb." Friends laid him down on the floor,
  and he remained there for some time. Finally he opened his
  eyes, looked at the lights on the ceiling, and felt they were
  cylinder-shaped. He raised his hands, grabbed one of those
  cylinder light beams, and sat up, "pulling himself up by that
  beam." He was still aware of his surroundings and noticed
  that people were watching him. His heart was beating fast, he
  was breathing hard, and his throat felt dry. Fortunately, he
  was constantly accompanied by his friend who subsequently
  corrobated his recollections. He "felt as though he was
  floating" but "he knew that in reality he was not floating."
  He knew that "friends were helping" him. His "legs felt numb"
  and as if "he was walking in a lake with the water up to his
  waist." His "hands appeared white and wrinkled" to him.
    At that point, he started feeling as if he was in a trance,
  and it was the first time that he did not know that people
  were around him. As he gradually came out of the trance, he
  could feel a ball in his hands; this ball would expand and
  contract as he moved his hands, but he could not see the ball.
  His friend said, "Touch something real!" He then touched the
  table and felt real again.
    Subsequently, he felt he kept going in and out of a
  trancelike state and could, on several occassions, even induce
  it himself. As he was walking, he felt that the floor was
  bow-shaped, and he had to hold on to the wall.
    He recalled that the following three hours were accompanied
  by these experiences: He would sit on a couch and he would
  drift away completely, "a great fog would be closing in" on
  him, and when he was surrounded by this fog "everything would
  turn black." "Spots of color, blue and red, would shine through
  this black cloud." Beyond the cloud, there seemed to him to be
  infinity. He "heard a massive confusion of sound," although to
  his knowledge there was no one talking and there were no sounds
  of any other nature at that time. But, again, when his friend
  called his name, he "came out of it." At times he felt excited,
  at times he felt relaxed. He remembered that he would often ask
  his friend to talk to him to keep him in reality. He found that
  he could, in this way, practically control his state of mind;
  that is, whether he would be in a trance state or not.
    When he looked at the picture of a countryside with deer in
  it, he felt as though he were floating into the picture and it
  took on a three-dimensional character. The deer were alive, the
  trees had shape. He started feeling everybody in the world
  could hear him. When he went out of the house and stepped onto
  the lawn, he anticipated that he would fall into it, as if
  into an ocean. He started writing in mirror writing,
  "Help! I'm trapped behind the world."

    He played a few notes on his recorder and felt that
  "each note was a brown disc." He then played a record; "the
  sound of music made a pattern of color. There was a central
  color and lines around it. The center was composed of the low
  notes, the bass, and the high notes were on the periphery."
  He remembered that sound made by "cymbals were silvery."
  This configuration kept changing, beating, and throbbing.
  Finally, he could not stand it no longer, and he turned the
  music off.
    By this time, some eight or nine hours had elapsed from the
  ingestion of nutmeg. He started becoming confused, and memory
  (recall) became very poor. He fell asleep and seemed to realize
  that he could finally go to sleep without "dropping out."
 
  Comment
 
    The preceding narrative was given spontaneously by an
  intelligent, perceptive, and sensitive adolescent who had had
  prior experience with marihuana and morning-glory seeds. The
  frequent connection of the two is known. (3, 5) He felt that on
  marihuana, the predominant feeling was one of enjoyment and
  happiness, of being liked and floating. Hallucinations were
  less marked. On morning-glory seeds, he also had a light,
  floating sensation, but it seemed to be of a different kind,
  and the most marked thing was a constant feeling of euphoria.
  On both these substances, he felt he never really left reality,
  and he thought that this was a major distinction between these
  substances and nutmeg.
    He repeated his experience with nutmeg in a smaller dose.
  On one tablespoon full of the substance he "felt high" or
  sometimes "weird," but without hallucinations; music sounded
  better although it did not sound louder. None of the colourful
  changes in perception occurred on the small dose of nutmeg.
    The description given by this patient is richer and more
  colorful than the previous reports, (3,6,7) although the
  previous descriptions also contained many of the experiences
  reported here, such as lapses of attention, although
  consciousness was retained, (6) depersonalization, (6) bright
  colors, (3) a floating feeling, (3) and music being more
  enjoyable. (3)
    Follow-up on this patient showed that he continued taking
  marihuana but stopped taking nutmeg. Psychodynamically, the
  patient was in the midst of an identity crisis, trying to
  deal with his leanings toward dependency and passivity by
  indentifying with the "hippie" groups. The patient's father
  had been incapacitated for several years because of psychiatric
  difficulties also centering around dependency and passivity.
 
  Summary
 
    Some of the pertinent literature on the use of nutmeg as a
  hallucinogen is briefly reviewed. It is noted that descriptions
  of experience with this substance in adolescents are lacking.
    Feelings of depersonalization and unreality, changes in
  perception, as well as illusions and hallucinations, especially
  visual, were the significant aspects of the subjective
  experience of an eighteen-year-old adolescent. The patient was
  also able to differentiate the effects of nutmeg from those of
  marihuana and morning-glory seeds, on the basis of a temporary
  break with reality which he experienced with nutmeg.
    Although the unfortunate easy availability of other
  hallucinogens probably makes nutmeg intoxication a relatively
  rare occurrence, mainly as experimentation or when other
  substances are not available, the medical profession should be
  reminded of its possible use and its hallucinogenic effects.

  Nutmeg. - Convicts and sailors sometimes have recourse to
  nutmeg. About a tablespoon is swallowed with water. Results
  are vaguely similar to marijuana with side effects of headache
  and nausea. Death would probably supervene before addiction
  if such addiction is possible. I have only taken nutmeg once.
    There are a number of narcotics of the nutmeg family in use
  among the Indians of South America. They are usually
  administered by sniffing a dried powder of the plant. The
  Medicine Men take these noxious substances, and go into
  convulsive states. Their twitchings and mutterings are thought
  to have prophetic significance. A friend of mine was violently
  sick for three days after experimenting with a drug of the
  nutmeg family in South America.
