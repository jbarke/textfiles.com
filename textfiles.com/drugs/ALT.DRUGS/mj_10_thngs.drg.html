   10 Things Every Parent, Teenager & Teacher Should Know

                       About

                     Marijuana


  "Prohibition...goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to
   control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things
   that are not crimes. A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very
   principles upon which our government was founded."

      -- Abraham Lincoln
            December, 1840

  1 Q. What is Marijuana?

    A. "Marijuana" refers to the dried leaves and flowers of the cannabis
       plant [1], which contain the non-narcotic chemical THC at various
       potencies. It is smoked or eaten to produce the feeling of being
       "high." The different strains of this herb produce different sensual
       effects, ranging from sedative to stimulant.

  2 Q. Who Uses Marijuana?

    A. There is no simple profile of a typical marijuana user. It has been
       used for 1000s of years for medical, social, and religious reasons
       and for relaxation [2]. Several of our Presidents [3] are believed
       to have smoked it. One out of every five Americans say they have
       tried it. And it is still popular among artists, writers, musicians,
       activists, lawyers, inventors, working people, etc.

  3 Q. How Long Have People Been Using Marijuana?

    A. Marijuana has been used since ancient times [4]. While field hands
       and working people have often smoked the raw plant, aristocrats
       historically prefer hashish [5] made from the cured flowers of the
       plant. It was not seen as a problem until a calculated disinformation
       [sic] campaign was launched in the 1930s [6], and the first American
       laws against using it were passed [7].

  4 Q. Is Marijuana Addictive?

    A. No, it is not [8]. Most users are moderate consumers who smoke it
       socially to relax. We now know that 10% of our population have
       "addictive personalities" and they are neither more nor less
       likely to overindulge in cannabis than in anything else. On a
       relative scale, marijuana is less habit forming than either sugar
       or chocolate but more so than anchovies. Sociologists report a general
       pattern of marijuana use that peaks in the early adult years, followed
       by a period of levelling off and then a gradual reduction in use [9].

  5 Q. Has Anyone Ever Died From Smoking Marijuana?

    A. No; not one single case, not ever. THC is one of the few chemicals for
       which there is no known toxic amount [10]. The federal agency NIDA says
       that autopsies reveal that 75 people per year are high on marijuana
       when they die: this does not mean that marijuana caused or was even a
       factor in their deaths. The chart below compares the number of deaths
       attributable to selected substances in a typical year:

       Tobacco...............................340,000 - 395,000
       Alcohol (excluding crime/accidents).............125,000+
       Drug Overdose (prescription)............24,000 - 27,000
       Drug Overdose (illegal)...................3,800 - 5,200
       Marijuana.............................................0

  6 Q. Does Marijuana Lead to Crime and/or Hard Drugs?

    A. No [11]. The only crime most marijuana users commit is that they use
       marijuana. And, while many people who abuse dangerous drugs also smoke
       marijuana, the old "stepping stone" theory is now discredited, since
       virtually all of them started out "using" legal drugs like sugar,
       coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, etc.

  7 Q. Does Marijuana Make People Violent?

    A. No. In fact, Federal Bureau of Narcotics director Harry Anslinger once
       told Congress just the opposite - that it leads to non-violence and
       pacifism [12]. If he was telling the truth (which he and key federal
       agencies have not often done regarding marijuana), then re-legalizing
       marijuana should be considered as one way to curb violence in our
       cities. The simple fact is that marijuana does not change your basic
       personality. The government says that over 20 million Americans still
       smoke it, probably including some of the nicest people you know.

  8 Q. How Does Marijuana Affect Your Health?

    A. Smoking anything is not healthy, but marijuana is less dangerous than
       tobacco and people smoke less of it at a time. This health risk can
       be avoided by eating the plant instead of smoking it [13], or can be
       reduced by smoking smaller amounts of stronger marijuana. There is
       no proof that marijuana causes serious health or sexual problems [14]
       but, like alcohol, its use by children or adolescents is discouraged.
       Cannabis is a medicinal herb that has hundreds of proven, valuable
       theraputic uses - from stress reduction to glaucoma to asthma to
       cancer therapy, etc. [15].

  9 Q. What About All Those Scary Statistics and Studies?

    A. Most were prepared as scare tactics for the government by Dr. Gabriel
       Nahas, and were so biased and unscientific that Nahas was fired by
       the National Institute of Health [16] and finally renounced his own
       studies as meaningless [17]. For one experiment, he suffocated monkeys
       for five minutes at a time, using proportionately more smoke than the
       average user inhales in an entire lifetime [18]. The other studies
       that claim sensational health risks are also suspect, since they lack
       controls and produce results which cannot be replicated or
       independently verified [19].

 10 Q. What Can I Do About Marijuana?

    A. No independent government panel that has studied marijuana has ever
       recommended jail for users [20]. Concerned persons should therefore
       ask their legislators to re-legalize and tax this plant, subject to
       age limits and regulations similar to those on alcohol and tobacco.

     Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and others smoked hashish, as did Benjamin
     Franklin and Mary Todd Lincoln. President John F. Kennedy is also
     reported to have smoked marijuana to relieve his back pain. Many of
     America's greatest leaders and Founding Fathers (including George
     Washington) were hemp farmers. Sources: National Archives, published
     reports.

     cultivated by humans - about 8000 B.C. - and was used for linen,
     paper, and garments. Source: Columbia University, _History of the
     World_. It was being smoked in China and India as early as 2700 B.C.

     authorities found no reason to restrict its use. But the notorious
     yellow journalist William Randolph Hearst fabricated and published
     horror stories about marijuana that were eventually investigated and
     shown to be lies, but not until long after the marijuana prohibition
     was enacted in 1938. Source: Larry Sloman, _Reefer Madness_.
