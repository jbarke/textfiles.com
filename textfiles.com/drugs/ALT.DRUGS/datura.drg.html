Jimson weed is Datura Stramonium, a member of the nightshade family.
The active chemicals in Jimson include atropine, scopolamine, and
hyoscamine.  The buzz from this family of psychotropic plants is more
like a dilerium with very strong hallucinations than anything else.
Jimson is very poisonous, the buzz couldn't really be described as
recreational, and I wouldn't try it, myself.  If you decide to
experiment with it, be *extremely* careful, because just a little too
much could kill you.  I have tried smoking a small amount of Datura
Inoxia, and the buzz is interesting, but not overly pleasant.  It has
been reported that Datura Inoxia has been added to marijuana for extra
effects, but I don't have any firsthand knowledge of this combination,
since I personally wouldn't even *think* of doing any *illegal* drugs. ;-)
It's possible that Datura Stramonium could be used in the same way,
but I haven't heard or read of anyone trying this.

    Actually Datura is one psychoactive that you may be wiser to  have
    nothing   to   do   with.   I   shall   quote   a   passage   from
    Psychedelic_Drugs_Reconsidered   ,   a  generally  pro-psychedelic
    text.  

Anticholinergenic Deleriants.

    These drugs are not usually regarded  as  psychedelic  ,  although
    they have a great deal in  common  historically,  culturally,  and
    pharmacologically  with  other drugs taken for their mind-altering
    powers. They are called anticholinergic  because  they  block  the
    action  f  acetylcholine  ,  a  nerve  transmitter  substance that
    controlls  the  contraction  of skeletal muscles and also plays an
    important  role  in  the  chemistry  of the brain. They are called
    deleriants  because their effects at high doses include incoherent
    speach,   disorientation,  delusions,  an  halucinations  ,  often
    followed by depression and amnesia for the period of intoxication.
    The   classical  anticholinergic  delirients  are  the  belladonna
    alkaloids:

    These  tropane  derivatives,  the  most powerfull and important of
    which is scopolamine, are found  in  differing  concentrations  in
    various plants of the Nightshade Family or Solanaceae, among  them
    deadly  nightshade  (Atropa   belladona),   mandrake   (Mandragora
    officinarum), black henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), jimsonweed (Datura
    stramonium, and over twenty other species of henbane  and  datura.
    Of all psychoactive drugs , only alcohol has been in  use  for  so
    long over such a large part of the world. For thousands  of  years
    on all inhabited continents the belladonna alkaloids have  been  a
    tool   of  shamans  and  sorcerers,  who  take  advantage  of  the
    sensations they evok to leave their bodies, soar through the  air,
    or  change into an animal in their imagination.  They also produce
    toxic  organic  symptoms  like headache, dry throat, loss of motor
    control, blurred vision , and greatly increased heart rate and and
    body temperature; death from paralysis and respiratory may occur.

    The belladonna alkaloids are so terrifying  and  incapacitating  -
    the physical effects often so unpleasant, and the loss of  contact
    with  ordinary  reality so complete - that they are used only with
    great caution and rarely  for  pleasure.  For  the  same  reasons,
    ironically, they are not regarded as a drug abuse problem and  can
    be bought in small doses on perscription  or  in  over-the-counter
    sedatives and pills for asthma, colds, and motion sickness.

Mmmmmaybe. _Brugmansia_ spp. are related to _Datura_, true...but the
"tree Daturas" are not quite the same as far as chemical makeup as what we
all know as Datura. Brugmansias, as a whole group, are _significantly_
more potent (having a higher and somewhat different alkaloid makeup) than
Daturas of any species. Even Schultes and Hoffman, in _Plants_of_the_Gods_,
treat these as two very different plants, with their own separate sections
in the book.
	Incidentially, Schultes and Hoffman also note that neither
_Brugmansia_arborea_ nor _Datura_arborea_ is the correct classification
of this plant. Its proper taxonomic identification is _Brugmansia_aurea_,
which is the most widespread of the Brugmansias in the Andes, where they
are native.
	Yes, I'd say this would be some hysterical overstatements if this
were an article on Datura, also. But this is Brugmansia we're dealing
with here...a very different plant. There's also been deaths from it in
the USA in the tropical regions (Florida, and such) because of people
treating it lightly like they might _Datura_stramonium_. It's not a plant
for casual play, in my experience and opinion.

I can confirm the validity of the description above from my own experience.
This was from a TEA made out of the leaves of Datura Stramonium.
If you want hallucinations this is your drug. However "you" are not there
to experience them. This stuff takes over completely and irreversibly for
at least 24 hours. Stupidly, I went out while the effects had not yet
fully started. After having been thrown out of a bar, where I was
desperately searching for my briefcase that was suposed to be there someplace
(but which i hadn't even with me ) I found myself in a city that i did not
recognize. I did not remember where I came from , where to go , what do do,
who I was, let alone what I was doing there at this time of night, nor did
I have any clue how to get "home" as far as there was still a conception 
of what home might be. There was complete retrograde amnesia: no acces  to
any knowledge at all. In the mean time I had encounters with people I knew
, that were able to do a disapearing act. Just by standing behind a light
pole they could make themselves invisible. (This must be the "witches sabbath"
hallucination , which seems recurrent in this type of delirium: the very
very real hallucination of speaking with people). Also I was constantly
hallucinating that I was smoking a cigarette, which whould suddenly disappear
leaving me searching te street , thinking that i dropped it. Witches are
actually shrubs growing in front yards (they live underground, the
branches are the hairs) Lots and lots of little bugs hand each other berries
along branches. I must have walked the same street 50 times back and forth
Wanting to get somewhere , forgetting were i was going to or were i was
in the first place. A small statue of a child alongside the road started
laughing and laughing harder and harder every time i passed, it was a
ridiculous sight to see this idiot come by for the 40th time, even for a
statue. And so on . For 24 hours.  It was a really interesting experience,
not a nice one, I could not see straight for a week (due to
anticholinergic parasympatholytic effect of atropine/scopolamine.)

Only for those who want to be able to say that they tried EVERYTHING.
