No/no. I did about 7 grams of Syrian rue seeds last weekend. Never again. It
did produce some interesting visuals, and a narcotic (yes, I know it's not
really a narcotic, but it felt like it) effect. It also produced the worst
nausea and vomiting I have ever experienced in my entire life. Awful is the
only word to describe it. The next day I was still somewhat sick and very
groggy. Has anyone had a GOOD experience from moderate/large dosages of Syrian
Rue seeds? Was the nausea because of the harmaline, or due to other things in
the seeds?

A FOAF once chewed approximately 10 grams of harmala seeds. The full effects
started within half an hour of ingestion, with occasional feelings of
weightlessness and a peculiar enchanced and distorted perception of sound.
He lay on his bed, eyes closed, and was immediately immersed in a visual
fantasy starting with floating eyes (;-), one of which eventually swallowed the
psychonaut and threw him into The World of Spirits(tm). The visionary and
auditory quest continued for quite a while, during which our brave
experimenter had an alarmingly high pulse and was seriously contemplating
whether stroke or cerebral haemorrhage comes first.

The body load was so horrible that he was unable to write down his experiment
by any means, and any movement was extremely painful. He was nauseated but
did not expel the contents of his stomach, although it probably would've been
better if he had - the seeds don't digest too well. He was also completely
unable to sleep during the whole night. The experiment started at around 8 pm.
(post mortem?)

As for the trip, it was very much like how Ayahuasca is often described.
Perhaps this knowledge affected the course of our apprentice ayahuascero's
voyage. Anyway, there were e.g. eyes-closed visions of the Amazonas, with
sparkly fireworks in the sky. The statue of a hawk-headed deity, accompanied
by a section of Revolution 9 (on the auditory side) appeared. No jaguars,
however. ;-) There was very little, if no synesthesia and visual distortions
were limited to a blurred vision and very strong tracers. Emotional effects
were very profound and he encountered an extemely critical inner voice pointing
out how he had neglected and mistreated the people around him. There was
also a sensation that could be best described as "cognitive feedback" and which
is often felt during high fever. He felt telepathic contact with the late(?)
curandera Maria Sabina and some people, supposedly Americans, who had
permanently crossed the river Styx as a result of Ayahuasca experiments.
This was probably influenced by a net article describing a butane huffer who
saw spirits of people who had died from said indulgence.

Well, that's about it. It doesn't make much sense and there's no logical
or chronological continuum, but considering the circumstances, it's an
adequate sum-up of my friend's experience. He might have left something out
or thrown in an after-fancy, as this happened almost a year ago.

By the way, he had not eaten or drunk anything which could've interacted
with the alkaloids, so they were fully responsible of the dangerous
sympathomimetic side effects. I advise excercising some caution before
chewing up a bloody ounce of the stuff. As to DMT, comparing my friend's
experience with the Ayahuasca one, I'd say that the only difference is
the level of visual effects and perhaps the combination being more "unreal".

I just saw this article in an old issue of the Entheogen Review and 
thought some would find it interesting...  

Combing P. harmala with P. Cubensis

	You asked me to tell you when I knew the results of my proposed 
experiments with P. harmala and P. cubensis.  I have since found that one 
gram of harmala extract more than doubled the effects of two grams of 
cubensis.  That is, subjectively, the experience was at least as strong 
as previous five gram doses - a true example of "less is more!"  The 
experience was qualitively different also - colors seemed not quite as 
vived, though more patterns were pronounced; I was physically almost 
unable to move for two or three hours (making shamanistic work all but 
impossible), and the trip lasted at least two hours longer than expected, 
with a long slow decline after the peak.  Be careful, though - I 
unthinkingly drank a cup of coffee the next day and quickly developed a 
splitting headache.  This was possibly the effect of MAO inhibition, 
since I practically never get headaches of any kind.  Best luck with The 
Entheogen Review.

	Does anyone have any info on Peganum harmala?  I have a lot, but 
I think a FAQ is needed..... ANyone?  ANyone?

Actually, its funny that I just saw Ted's post....as I was just about to
make a post of my own concerning a harmala + psilocybin trip I took last
night.
 
I began by crushing up 2.5 grams of harmala seeds, and swallowing them -
qui]it{ a disgusting taste... I waited about 30-45 minutes for them to
digest (and to see if i would throw up) before eating my shrooms. I felt a
slight queasiness in my stomach, but not desire to yack, so I ate the
shrooms (about 30{45 mins after the harmala, like I said).
After eating 1.5g of shrooms (from a previous trip out of the same bag, i
knew them to be quitt({ potent shrooms), the trip began abo{t 20 minutes
after taking them. It came on more gradually than a pure shroom trip. The
trip itself was different than just plain shrooms. Its not really a
describably difference...it seems to open a different (but similar) door
in the mind. Physically, it felt different to. For example, although it
was about 70 degrees outside, it felt to be about 40 d{grees.... When I
walked, I felt somewhat drunk - I wasn't stumbling, my coordinatio{ seemed
fine...but there was that same sense of vertigo that you feel when walking
around drunk.{
Hallucinations were quite different. I remember looking at Venus and not
being able to decide if it was a star or a plane, because it kept moving.
Inside, colors seemed different, but not in the intense way caused by
plain shrooms - they seemed somewhat eartier, and I found myself attracted
to browns, greys, black, and dark reds - quite different from the
attraction to bright colors caused by pure psilocybin.
As{far as MAO inhibition... I was drinking cocacola all night (caffeine)
and ate a cheeseburger at mcdonalds (cheese & meat), but felt no{side
effects...h{wev{r, I do not recommend {ating alot of{ no-n{ foods,{because
althouh s{all quantities can be OK, chowing down on cheeses and alcohol or
yeast or meats could cause problems. Keep it simple, if you decide to trip
with harmala. (You probably wont feel very hungry anyways).
About halfway through the trip, i ate another gram of harmala, to prolong
the trip. It did seem to work...as the trip lasted about 6 hours total
(other trips from the same bag of shrooms, but with no harmala, lasted
only 3-4 hours). The come-down was very very slow, and the peak was quite
long as well. 
My thought-patterns were also{different than they usually are while on
shrooms or LSD. But like I said, th{ differences are very hard to
describe...they are subtle, but they add up to produce a quite distinct trip.
For one, it seemed like a less "freaky" trip. It was very intense, but
there was no sense of panic at all. I would probably feel OK going out to
dinner with my parents while being on this combination - the harmala
really seemed to add a calming aspect to the trip. It also seemed to be
less personal of a trip. Rather than a dive into the subconscious mind (as
with LSD/shrooms), it seemed to be a dive {nto what Jung called the
super-conscious Mind - th{ mind of humanity as{a whole. xDt(Alot of the
things I usually end up thinking of while tripping never crossed my
mind...and alot of things I have never thought about while tripping were
quite prominent in my mind last night.
Harmala is quite legal, and quite easy to get through various mail-order
botanical companies...I highly recomme{d anyone who i]uses shrooms or DMT
try mixing some harmala with the shrooms/DMT. It's incredible - like
tripping for the first time. And I like the doors that it opened in my
mind. I feel like this trip did a lot of good for me.
