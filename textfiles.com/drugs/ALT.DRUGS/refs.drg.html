While browsing through the computerized magazine index
at my local library, I came across these articles on
Terence McKenna.  They aren't actually the articles, but
a brief overview. Here it goes...

#1
AUTHOR:  Jocobson, Mark
TITLE:   Is Terence McKenna the brave prophet of the next
	      psychedelic revolution, or is his cosmic egg just
	     a little bit cracked?
SOURCE:  Esquire v117 p107-9+ June '92
CONTAINS:Illustration(s); portrait

SUBJECTS COVERED:
Hallucinogenic drugs
PSILOCYBIN
mushrooms
McKenna, Terence K.:1946-

ABSTRACT: Terence McKenna, who has been called the Timothy
Leary of the 1990's, is acknowledged as the leading spokesman
for the "psychedelic position."  McKenna, who appears semiregularly
on the spiritualist/New Age lecture circuit, makes his living by 
discussing his experiences with LSD-25 and psilocybin mushrooms.
Cassettes of McKenna's psychedelic polemics have been popular
for some time.  Within the next year [remeber, this was writen
in June, '92] 5 books detailing McKenna's ideas will be published
including The Archaic Revival: Speculations on Psyedelic Mushrooms,
the Amazon, Virual Reality, UFOs, Evolution, Shamanism, the Rebirth
of the Goddess, and the End of History.  McKenna's personal
life and beliefs are discussed, and the writer describes his
visits with McKenna.


#2  [a little bit more recent]
AUTHOR:     Miller, Sukie
TITLE:	Interview: Terence McKenna
SOURCE:	Omni v15 p69-70+ May '93
CONTAINS:	illustration(s); portraits

SUBJECTS COVERED:
Psilocybin
mushrooms
Hallucinogenic drugs
McKenna, Terence K.:1946-

ABSTRACT:	Terence McKenna is an ethnobotanist, a radical
historian, and a world-class psychedelic researcher. McKenna
comes from the 1960s tradition of viewing psychedelic-drug
taking as self-experimental, informational, and educational.
He was born in 1946 in western Colorado and studied shamanism
and the conservation of natural resources at the University of
California at Berkely.  For years, he made a living collecting
Asian art and butterflies, but he has since become a high-voltage
speaker and prolific writer.  In his 1992 book Food of the
Gods, McKenna chronicled a radical history of drugs and human
evolution and extolled the virtues of psilocybin mushrooms
and DMT, a potent psychedelic compound.  In and interview, 
McKenna explains his theories and discusses the effects of
psychedelics.
