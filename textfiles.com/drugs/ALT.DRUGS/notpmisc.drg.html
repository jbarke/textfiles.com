Earlier, there were some questions about amino acids on alt.drugs.
I posted a scanty summary of some of aminos I was interested in.
More questions appeared after that, posted and in my mail box.
This file is quite a bit more complete but still doesn't list 
many of the 22 or so AAs. (eg. alanine, histidine, idoleucine,
proline, serine, threonine, valine... these are all common, but
i haven't found much info on them). 
Documentation and sources are missing, so please don't take this
file too seriously. I probably won't create another version of
this for a while.

(Note that this is a Folded file, for those with MSDOS machines and
 the shareware editor.)


=============================
AMINO ACIDS AND THEIR EFFECTS
=============================
Version 1.1
Compiled by: Bj Krawchuk (krawchuk@cpsc.ucalgary.ca)
Several sources have been used and may be requested from above.

(*@/// Phenylalanine *)
(*@/// L-phenylalanine *)
L-phenylalanine
        - converted into tyrosine which is
           precursor to noradrenaline (NE) and dopamine
        - like all amino acids best taken on empty stomach since it competes
          with proteins to cross the blood brain barrier.
        - requires vitamins C and B-6 for the conversion to NE.
        - Dosage: 500 - 1000mg along with 1g C, 30-50mg B-6
        - phenylalanine also stimulates the release of
          cholecystokinin, which is the body's own appetite-suppressant,
        - can increase sexual interest
        - improves memory and mental alertness
        - antidepressant
        - do not use L-phenylalanine or L-tyrosine if you are
          using MAO inhibitors for depression (it can cause a
          major elevation in blood pressure).
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// DL-phenylalanine *)
DL-phenylalanine
          - combination of synthetic (D) and natural (L) phenylalanine
          - produces endorphins and stimulates their use
          - thus, effective painkiller, often better than the
            opiate derivatives such as morphine.
          - nonaddictive, nontoxic
          - reverse-tolerance effect (pain relief gets better)
          - strong anti-depressant effect
          - can be combined with other pain-killers
            with few bad interactions
(*@\\\*)
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Tyrosine *)
L-tyrosine
        - precursor to norepinephrine and dopamine
        - non-essential amino acid (since PA is converted into it first)
        - has been studied as an effective aid to cocaine withdrawal
        - (see L-phenylalanine)
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Tryptophan *)
L-tryptophan
        - precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin along with
          B6, niacin, and magnesium.
        - (actually immediate precursor to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP)
           which is the precursor to serotonin (5HT))
        - prolongs slow-wave sleep
        - reduces pain sensitivity
        - no effect or increases REMS
        - has some hypnotic effects
        - useful for some types of endogenous depression
          (has been found as useful as imipramine and amitriptyline)
        - aids in reducing anxiety and tension
        - an appetite supressant
        - dosages have been studied up to 15g
        - Major Food Sources:
              Cottage cheese, milk, meat, fish, turkey, bananas,
              dried dates, peanuts, all protein-rich foods.
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Lysine *)

L-lysine
        - needed for growth and enzyme, hormone, antibody production
        - aids concentration
        - treatment for some sterility problems
        - treatment and prevention for herpes infections
        - aids fatty acid -> energy conversion
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Arginine *)
L-arginine
        - used to increase sperm counts
          (semen contains up to 80% of arginine)
        - aids immune response and healing of wounds
        - helps stored fat metabolism
        - helps to tone muscle tissue
        - used for weight-loss in combination with L-ornithine
        - one amino acid required for production of growth hormone
(*@\\\*)
(*@/// Ornithine *)
L-ornithine
        - similar to arginine
        - growth hormone (which acts as a fat metabolizer) is
          stimulated to be released by ornithine and arginine.
        - can be used as a slimming technique (while you sleep -
          GH is released by the pituitary gland then)

Tyrosine is available in a free form base from Vitamin Research Products
based in Mountain View, CA.  call (415) 555-1212 for number.  Suggestion
would be to start with 100mg of tyrosine at first, then to increase (weekly)
to 300mg.  Overdose symptoms include  irratibility.  This will need to be taken
with several precursor vitamins like C B-5,6,12, for uptake into the
blood/brain barrier.  This amino wil compete with protein uptake, so take it
on an empty stomach - see the book 'Life Extension" D. Pearson & S. Shaw -

***************************** Article Separation ******************************

A safe stimulant which is not caffiene does exist and it available as
a non-prescription drug from many health food stores. It's called
Dimethylaminoethanol, or DMAE. It works pretty well as a stimulant and
also increases levels of acetylcholine (it's a precursor). It also
makes rats perform significantly better on maze tests, because the
increased acetylcholine assists in some aspects of memory.

Another way to decrease need for sleep is to raise brain levels of
dopamine, which can be done by taking phenylalanine. It should be
taken on an empty stomach (500 mg to 1 gram is a reasonable dose)
with 1g vitamin C and 50 mg vitamin B-6 to assist in the conversion of
phenylalanine to dopamine. Another way to take the phenylalanine
is to place a small amount between the upper lip and gum about halfway back
in the mouth. There are blood vessels there which go directly to the brain.
If you're using this method, you should try a smaller dose (100 mg), as it is
more effective when taken in this manner.

Using these and other "safe" (i.e. adjusting the body's own chemicals
rather than introducing something new; not necessarily safe but a priori
a better bet than most traditional stimulants) I have been able to
cut my need for sleep by 4 hours per day without discomfort for weeks at a
time. I have no reason to believe that they would not be effective if
used longer, but circumstances of class work seldom required me to cut
sleep for longer periods than this.

Be advised, however, that these methods will not be as powerful as,
say, amphetamines or even high-dose caffiene, but they are not likely to
mess you up either. But if you are trying to stay up for two nights
to finish some huge project, you might be better off sticking with
caffiene and cold showers.

Yes, aspartame is the methyl ester of phenylalanine and aspartic acid,
two amino acids. According to Richard Wurtman of MIT, you can get
increases in brain levels of phenylalanine if low-protein foods such
as soft drinks are consumed on an empty stomach.

The brain requires vitamins B-6 and C to convert phenylalanine into
the natural stimulant noradrenaline and another important brain chemical,
dopamine (which is also, among other things, a stimulant and euphoric)

Thus even if you are taking no supplemental phenylalanine, you can
still get beneficial effects on mood, etc., by taking C and B-6
because your brain will become more efficient at converting the
phenylalanine that is already present in your diet.

Speaking of diets, phenylalanine also stimulates the release of
cholecystokinin, which is the body's own appetite-suppressant,
used to tell the brain when the stomach has had enough. So phenylalanine
acts indirectly as an appetite-suppressant.

Note that all of the effects of phenylalanine are greatly enhanced if
it is taken either on an empty stomach or with low-protein foods,
because various proteins compete with phenylalanine for transport
across the blood-brain barrier.

Dosage: 500mg to 1g phenylalanine, plus 1g C, 30 to 50mg B-6.

WARNING: Do NOT use phenylalanine: 
	*If you are using MAO inhibitors, unless they are the extremely 
		selective types such as deprenyl (selegiline); 
	*If you have a cardiac arrythmia; 
	*If you have hypertension; 
	*If you have phenylketonuria; 
	*If you have a psychosis; 
	*If you have a pigmented malignant melanoma-type cancer; 
	*If you have a violent temper. 

If you are taking other stimulants such as phenylpropanolamine, ephedrine,
or even, potentially, caffiene or theophylline, you should monitor your
blood pressure carefully because there is a possiblity of blood pressure
rise and other problems characteristic of adrenaline-like drug oversoda.

   Phenylalanine and many other amino acid supplements are available
mail-order from Vitamin Research Products, 2044 Old Middlefield Way,
Mountain View, CA 94043 USA.  
   Tryptophan is currently banned for sale in the US, due to the 
contamination scare of last year.  The source of the contamination
was found (an experimental genetically-engineered bacteria used by
_one_ Japanese firm to manufacture the Tryptophan) but the FDA has
still refused to lift the ban.

Some friends of mine make a vitamin formula that they sell to drug treatment
clinics to combat the neurotransmitter deficit caused by stimulant abuse...
It really works,a lot of people have been helped off cocaine with it.

There are two separate preparations, an AM and PM formula,
The PM formula used to contain tryptophan,but now does not,obviously,
However,they have had some sucess with a formula that maximizes the conversion
of dietary tryptophan into serotonin.

Here is the formula...

AM......

L-tyrosine               250 mg.
D,L phenylalanine        125 mg.
Pantothenic acid         25 mg.
PABA                     25 mg.
DMAE                     25 mg.
Rubidium Cl              25 mg.
Tocopherol acetate       12.5 mg.
Beta carotene            2.5 mg.
Manganese (gluconate)    2.5 mg.
Folic acid               0.1 mg
Copper gluconate         .125 mg
Selenium                 .25 mg.


PM.......

Niacinamide (ascorbate)   250 mg.
Taurine                   50 mg.
Magnesium oxide           50 mg.
Pyridoxine                25 mg.
Niacin                    12.5 mg.
Riboflavin                12.5 mg
Zinc                      2.5 mg.
Beta carotene             2.5 mg.
Chromium (GTF)             .025 mg.
Vitamin B12                .0125 mg.



This is basically a neurotransmitter boosting formula and benefits those
who dont have a drug abuse problem too.

*************************** Article Separation *********************************

I was recently lucky enough to be given several ounces of pure DMAE
(dimethylaminoethanol) and boy,is it ever a lot better than the Twinlab
stuff,which I had previously been using...

I use it in combination with tyrosine in the morning and it has dramatically
improved my memory (and an interesting sideffect is the induction of lucid
dreams...)

A good source for DMAE are the AIDS buying clubs that have popped up in
major cities..(although thats not where I got this..)

For anyone interested in neurotransmitter precursor supplementation
(DMAE,a relative of choline,is a precursor of acetylcholine)
this one REALLY works..

                Legal High Of The Month - for February 1992
                ------------------------------------------- 


This month's legal high is not a single substance, but a subject...
SMART DRUGS.  If you regularly read MONDO 2000 or alt.cyberpunk, just
skip this posting because you already know it all... otherwise, read on!

Many of you might have heard of Smart Drugs, via NPR, or the Nightly News
(and also Nightline).  Smart Drugs are a *new* breed of drugs termed
*nootropic*.  Nootropic comes from the Greek word meaning "acting on
the mind".  Nootropic drugs have in common.... (1) They all work on
the brain and/or blood/brain barrier and (2) They all have *fairly* low
toxicity levels.

Smart Drugs can do things like:

     1)  Improve mental functioning and even increase IQ (lots of arguments
         on the IQ increasing - but research is proving it true)
     2)  Increase lifespan (30% or higher)
     3)  Decrease some of the *bad* degenerative effects of aging
     4)  Increase mental clarity
     5)  Done in combination with *illegal drugs*, Smart Drugs can undo
         some of the less-desirable effects (eg., foggyness, dizzyness,
         tiredness etc..).

On Toxicity:

Many of the nootropic drugs are SO nontoxic that the PDR lists them as
having no known overdose levels, and no known symptoms or contradictions.
THIS IS NOT TO SAY that ALL smart drugs are safe.  Certainly not... and 
you should be fairly knowledgable about them before you do them - especially
in combination!  A couple of the nootropic drugs do have contradictions
so PLEASE be careful in experimentation.  (Note, certain combinations of
nootropic drugs, done together, will have unpleasant, if not dangerous
effects - PLEASE BE CAREFUL - never experiment with them together, until
you have experimented with them each, individually, over a period of time.
Make SURE you read the PDR on each of them, because some of them do have
contradictions, especially if you have other conditions (eg., angina, etc..)).

What Do They Do?

Here is a partial (very partial) list of some smart drugs.  ALL these
drugs are available, in the US, by prescription.  ALL of these drugs
are available, outside of the US, without prescription AND MAY LEGALLY
BE BROUGHT INTO THE US by you (more on this at the end of the article).

The following table lists SOME of the drugs, their use as smart drugs,
the NORMAL dose, and their use in the US, as indicated by the FDA.  Blank
items are because I don't have all my reference material at my side.  Note
that most of this information came via Mondo 2000, and other books.

How To Get Them:

Most of these drugs are available in the US, by prescription.  They are
usually approved by the FDA for uses NOT IN THE LIST ABOVE (for example,
Vasopressin is used in the US for bladder control, but it has NOT been
approved in the US for its memory functions, which require it to go through
the multi-year cycle (and millions of dollars) for approval for that use).

HOWEVER, due to the AIDS situation, the FDA has loosened the laws governing
what you can bring in from other countries.  It is now LEGAL to purchase
a PERSONAL SUPPLY (not to exceed 3 months) of these (and other) drugs from
firms in Europe, as long as they are regarded as safe in other countries.

You can purchase these drugs from several companies, whose addresses are
listed below:

     INHOME HEALTH SERVICES                INTERLAB
     P.O. Box 3112                         BCM Box 5890
     CH-2800 Delemont Switzerland          London, WC1N 3XX England

Write them for their price lists.

I personally have ordered several times from Interlab (vasopressin) and
have been VERY impressed with their speed (spend the extra $10 for fast
shipment - it's worth it) and the quality of their service.  The bottles
of Vasopressin came sealed, from Sandoz Laboratories, and worked as 
advertised (it even did the bladder control trick).  To see what I was
getting ripped off for, I called the local drug store to inquire as to
the U.S. price for a bottle of Vasopressin, and my price from Interlab was
$10 CHEAPER than what I could get it from at the local store (assuming I
had a prescription).  PLEASE NOTE that these companies want you to sign a
statement saying that your doctor is working with you on this.

Also, look into a book by John Morgenthaler and Ward Dean, entitled
Smart Drugs & Nutrients (Walden Books, B. Dalton etc...).  And OF COURSE,
read alt.cyberpunk as well as MONDO 2000 for the latest and greatest in
smart drug research and information.
