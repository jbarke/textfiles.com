DMT is Dimethyl Tryptamine =  N,N Dimethyl 3-amino-ethyl indole.
It is a powerful hallucinogen, the prototype of this class, and
chemically related to psiloc(yb)in and more distantly to LSD.
Dose: around 60 mg.
Method of ingestion: usually smoked (inactive orally at reasonable doses.)
   Can be combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) to make it 
   orally active and increase the duration.
   Could be snuffed or or injected.
Duration of action: 2-5 minutes of peak, around half an hour of cruise.
Side effects: Stimulation and tactile hallucination during trip. No
   perceivable after-effects. No known long term side effects. May be
   some link with schizophrenia, since it has been detected in vivo.
Status: illegal in USA, Australia, most places.
History: is a component of some snuffs used by South American natives.
         also used in combination with MAOIs (harmaline etc.).
Availability: Very rarely available from dealers; rarely synthesised.
         Available from a range of natural sources.
Psychological effects: A very intense but brief trip, not really
         euphoric. Can be frightening because of the sudden onset.
	 Not really a party drug, rather an interesting experience.
         More intense than LSD, but hallucinations and perceptual
	 changes are of a somewhat different nature.

=============================================================================

There are three issues here which are a little confused:
1) strength in the sense of effective dose,
2) strength in terms of subjective intensity,
3) being a superior hallucinogen in some subjective sense.

Comparing DMT and LSD, the first is easy.
The effective dose of LSD is around 100 ug, of DMT is around 60 mg,
so in this sense, LSD is a much stronger hallucinogen.

In terms of intensity, they are difficult to compare. Part of the intensity
of DMT stems from the fact that the onset is virtually instantaneous;
one is taken from feeling normal to the peak of the trip in the space
of a few seconds, and this can be totally disorienting and frightening.
DMT does not have the euphoria of LSD, in fact it can be quite
uncomfortable. Also, the smoking of DMT is quite unpleasant compared
with eating some small object. The types of hallucinations experienced
within the peak of the DMT trip differ markedly from those in the peak
of the LSD trip. This difference is very hard to describe, although
one might contrast the dripping flowing colourful experience of LSD
with the DMT visuals in which everything becomes super sharp to the
point of being ripped into fragments, like placing a photo in a blender.
There is some colour enhancement, but it is more like lightning-bolts
of colour rather than flowing ripples of colour, and colours may
be actually entirely changed and several multiple images seen at once.
The 20-30 minute come-down of DMT is similar in experience and intensity
to a small dose of LSD, however one is likely to be too shattered by
the initial peak to worry about this much. The account Bob posted is
highly subjective and metaphorical (as is this one, I suppose) and I
doubt that many people would experience DMT in the way described there.
However, extending the duration of DMT by the use of monoamineoxidase
inhibitors (Ayahuasca,Yage,etc.) is supposed to be a very intense
experience and could give one time to become more involved in it.
It is possible to lose all contact with the senses and the world
briefly while on DMT, as it is, e.g. from a combination of nitrous
oxide and LSD. Also, psiloc(yb)in seems to have some similarity to
DMT whilst retaining similarity to LSD, in that during the psilocin
experience one can be transported into a different reality, although
one which is still definitely based sensually on this one, and
not be able to remember or understand everday reality.
Other hallucinogenic experiences, e.g. the delerium caused by
anti-cholinergics, might be still more intense than DMT in terms
of being completely removed from traditional reality, but I don't
think anyone would recommend experimenting with these dangerous
substances.

In terms of which is the superior hallucinogen, it depends on your
taste. DMT is very interesting and extremely intense, but not 
necessarily pleasant. LSD has more potential for pure recreation.
Most people would probably prefer LSD as a recreational hallucinogen,
and it would be ill-advised for someone who was not very familiar
with coping with the intensity of LSD to be thrust into the
intensity of DMT. On the other hand, if you don't like DMT, you only
have to hang on for a few minutes, whereas if you don't like LSD
you have to hang on for several hours.

This is, of course, apart from the dosage, all subjective.

I don't know as much about 5-Me-O DMT as DMT. THere is an important
difference, which is the dose. The former is effective at about
5mg-10mg from memory, the latter at 30-60mg. Thus, it is possible
to obtain sufficient 5-Me-O DMT from smoking some impure unrefined
sources (such as the poison of Bufo alvarius)..
Considering DMT as opposed to 5-Me-O DMT (which is IMHO by far
the more desirable material), and recalling that most people
find the peak of a DMT trip only to last a very few minutes
after smoking (i.e. you have to smoke it all at once, within
a few tokes, to obtain the peak) you can easily calculate the
necessary purity. Let us say, that one is capable of smoking
100mg of material in a few seconds. THis means that a DMT
containing mixture should be at least 30% pure to get sufficient
effect, and a 5-Me-O DMT mixture should be at least 5% pure.
In actual fact, it is not quite as bad as this, because if
you are using a free-base pipe, you can get away with lower
purities because the DMT is quite volatile, so initially, the
smoking process will concentrate the DMT. 

Comparing this to plant matter, which might be e.g. 0.3% DMT,
and you see at once, that you would need to smoke about 10 g
in a few seconds which is unrealistic. Hence, chemical
purification is necessary. 

The alternative is to take the plant source orally in
combination with the hallucinogenic monoamineoxidase
inhibitor harmaline (and related alkaloids). These
are most readily obtained from Peganum harmala
(or Banisteriopsis caapi) and serve to activate and
potentiate tryptamines, increasing intensity and
duration and giving oral activity to DMT.

> What are the effects (Like the pure stuff (DMT)) ?

A small amount gives a wierd feeling in the body and some
perceptual change. A larger amount gives strong body feelings
and heavy visual effects , somewhat similar to LSD, but
much more based around geometry, and changes of shape
perception. A very large dose is totally awesome, and
people's responses differ, from catatonia, to screaming,
to total ecstasy. Some people describe it as a religious
experience. Many people find they completely leave our
universe for the duration, which is generally up to 5 
minutes, with residual effects up to half an hour.
B
>Which plant(s) are best suited ? (Highest in DMT)

There are various possibilities. Since chemical purification
is generally necessary, the plant content is not vitally
important. Most important is supply - the best species
is one which grows locally, and in the US, the best
source is probably Desmanthus illinoensis.

purify DMT from a plant source, and more information about

Certainly much higher than the amount beyond which one would have
no concept of what a pipe, DMT, oneself, etc. is. Also much higher
than the amount one could get into ones body by smoking before
it was metabolised. I imagine that even if one hooked oneself

No idea. However, one of the most striking things about DMT is its
brutalness - the rush from completely baseline to another
universe in about five seconds. Starting off baseline does
little to alter the peak (which tends to override anything)
but alters the severity of the onset.
>

Yup - similar to above, except moreso. It takes a large dose
for the effects of the DMT to become visible over the effects of
the trip (likewise for LSD). Also, it is harder to trip on DMT post
psilocybin or LSD, since there is some cross tolerence.

Some combinations with DMT are worthwhile. A couple of beers
beforehand bluntens and deadens a little which can be very
helpful. A good amount of heads will add to the visual 
impact, and a good amount of hash will ad to the wierdness
and otherness. N2O & DMT is interesting, but the combination
is generally intense enough to cause amnesia, and lack of
any kind of regular consciousness for the period of intoxication.

Interesting concept. Like much of McKenna's work, I expect that

My limited understanding of US law suggests that if humans

(since the carrier weight can be included)
Such a theoretical machine as you suggest  would be covered by

Lamont is the expert on this, and he says yes. I am not convinced,
and I don't think there is any proper research published on
the subject. Even in the case of the traditional harmaline/DMT
interaction, the scientific data is minimal, and it is surmise
only that the DMT is orally activated by the MAOI effect
of the harmaline and not by some other effect.

=============================================================================

With respect to orally activating DMT with an MAOI,
Dennis McKenna has this to say in his '84 review article in J. Psych.
Drugs 16(4):

"The potentiation of the behavioral and pharmacological effects of
tryptamine derivatives by MAOIs has been investigated, although
the specific question of the oral potentiation of DMT and other parenterally-
active derivates has apparently not been investigated.  The effects
of DMT in human volunteers was assessed before and 3 days after treatment
with the MAOI iproniazid (Sai-Halasz 1963). Patients receiving DMT
at a reduced dose following the iproniazid treatment experienced
none of the visual illusions or disturbances of time and space perception
that typify the symptoms of the drug.  They reported only a feeling of
"strangeness."  Patients receiving a dose equivalent to that prior
to iproniazid had a two-phase response.  The first stage was similar
to the usual DMT effects, but less pronounced: illusions and hallucinations
were present but less colorful and only manifested themselves with the
eyes closed.  The second phase was characterized by a persistent feeling
of "strangeness" to which the patients often reacted negatively or 
indifferently.  Based on these trials, Sai-Halasz (1963) speculated
that the reduced effects may have been due to the higher 5-HT
concentration in the brain due to MAO inhibition, thus mitigating the
5-HT blocking effects of DMT.  This speculation was also supported
by the observation that prior administration of 1-methyl-d-lysergic acid
butanolamide, a powerful serotonin antagonist, greatly exacerbated
the psychotomimetic effects of DMT (Sai-Halasz 1962)."

So, it would appear that the answer to question 6 hasn't been established.
However, some studies (mentioned above) seem to have been done demonstrating 
an interaction between MAOIs and DMT.

Jeremy handled most of those questions better than I could, so I
don't have much else to add. I doubt there have been any deaths
attributable to DMT use.  Also, I don't recall endogenous DMT in humans
and Dennis doesn't mention it in his review article so it is either
recent (post 1984) knowledge or it is a misprint by the poster or
publisher and should refer to a related tryptamine.  Or maybe it's
another revalation from the self-constructing machine elves.

Light (1968), 2nd edition (1971) 


DMT Synthesis

STEP I

     Using an area of good ventilation or a fume hood, place a
1000 ml two hole roundbottom flask in an ice bath using the
setup in Figure II (you want a wobble stirrer in the top hole
of the flask, and a separatory dropping funnel into the side
entry). Add 400 ml cold anhydrous ether to the flask, in which
60 g indole is then dissolved, using the stirrer. To 100 ml
anhydrous ether in a separatory funnel add 50 g oxalyl
chloride. Slowly drip this solution into the vigorously
stirred indole solution over a period of 10 to 15 minutes.
Continue stirring 10 minutes longer. Allow the precipitate to
settle a few minutes and decant the liquid. Add anhydrous
ether and mix well. When satisfied as to the purity of the
precipitate, leave the golden precipitate in the flask for the
next step, which must follow immediately. Yield is
approximately 100 g.

STEP II

     Dimethylamine reacts readily with indole oxalyl chloride.
Use about 400 ml ice cold anhydrous ether in the same 2 neck
1000 ml RB flask used in Step I, with the precipitate in it
from Step I. Cool the ice bath further by using salt and ice.
Estimate the weight of the precipitate and use 100 g indole
oxalyl chloride. For this weight of IOC use two entire 50 g
containers of diethylamine since it will not keep if the
container seal is broken. Cool the amine in container much
below 0 C and dissolve 1 part amine in 3 parts anhydrous cold
ether. Amine may be stored in this solution. For use, warm
stock solution to room temperature and use the appropriate
aliquot. Set up the entire apparatus the same as when adding
the oxalyl chloride. Add the amine solution slowly to the IOC
with vigorous stirring. Stir for 1/2 hour after the addition
is complete. Vacuum filter the precipitate, using ether as a
wash. It is better to slurry the ether water with the
precipitate before filtering [method used]. Recrystallise from
hot ethanol or from a 50-50 methanol-benzene mixture.

STEP III

     Prepare apparatus as in Figure II (1-hole 1000 ml RB
flask set in heating mantle on magnetic stirrer with stir bar
in flask, and condenser inserted into top of flask). Prepare
the indole glyoxyl amide by melting and casting into sticks if
ether is to be used as a solvent. Aluminium foil makes a good
mould for casting pieces that will fit through the condenser.
Also a Soxhlet extractor may be used to add the crystals by
slow solution into the ether. Tetrahydrofluran, if available,
dissolves IGA and the compound is added slowly in the solution
form [method used].

     To a stirred mixture of 15 g LiAlH4 in 100 ml anhydrous
ether (or THF [used]) slowly add the sticks (or solution
[used]) of IGA until 20 g have been added. Keep the rate of
reaction at a reasonable rate or boil-over may occur [do
say!]. Stir and reflux for 90 minutes after the addition is
complete. Cool in an ice bath and begin to cautiously [do
say!] hydrolyse with chips of ice or a cold solution of
methanol, added through the condenser. When there is no
further reaction, add a few ml extra water and allow to settle
finally and decant the clear liquid into an evaporating
vessel. Filter the residue and wash several times with
ether-methanol or THF-methanol [used]. Evaporate the combined
extracts and if necessary, seed the heavy syrup with crystals
of DMT. With no seed crystals the product may take days or
even weeks to crystallise [weeks]. This crude product is
adequate for smoking [do say!]. In order to purify DMT, begin
after the LiAlH4 has been hydrolysed with methanol. Add 500 ml
satd. Na2SO4 solution, mix and filter. Wash with ether or THF
and neutralise the filtrate with 0.1 N HCl. Extract with ether
in a separatory funnel and neutralise the lower layer with 0.1
N NaOh, extracting this solution in turn with chloroform. The
chloroform layer is dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated,
and from it DMT crystallises on addition of petroleum ether.
The mother liquor can be chromatographed on an alumina column
using benzene-methanol in a 99.8 to 0.2 ratio. [This last
purification is quite difficult.]

are uncontrolled.

Each method of ingestion has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Oral DMT/harmaline is potentially the best method of ingestion
in terms of having a truely profound experience of useful duration.
Coming on to the experience a little more slowly gives the user
some time to adjust and to cope with and explore the altered state.
Oral DMT is probably the only viable route for most alt.drugs
readers, who can obtain the plants but who don't have the necessary
experience and equipment to sufficiently purify DMT for smoking,
and who do not have access to synthetic DMT.
Unfortunately, the liquors produced by boiling up plant DMT
sources may well make the user puke.

 Although an account of a very successful ayahuasca experience

Well, the temporariness makes the intensity bareable when the
material is smoked. The oral experience is gentler, but just
as profound, if not moreso. Smoked DMT is so brutal, and the 
effect can be so profound, that after much experience, all I 
could say was that I couldn't say anything adequate about it, 
and so I gave up on it.

Don't make the mistake of calling DMT pleasurable - that may
or may not be one of its side-effects :). In fact, 
apart from the physical, smoked DMT is more likely to be
dysphoric than oral DMT. A single user may have one DMT
trip which is totally orgasmic, and then another which is
totally horrific, and then another that is neither.
Smoking the chemical is particularly unpleasant to the
mouth, throat, and lungs, and some people find it an
impossible task.

Hot DMT vapours are somewhat soluble in water; if you are smoking
the chemical, then mostly what you are getting is its vapour, and

The South American snuffs contained various tryptamines. It is
well nigh impossible to get a sufficient dose of DMT from a
snuffed plant source - the concentrations just aren't high 
enough. Likewise smoking a plant. The major active in the
snuffs was probably 5-MeO-DMT.

Lots of experiments in the 60's. If you have something pure
enough to inject, you might as well smoke it and save yourself
the hassle. Likewise, there is probably little advantage to
snorting the pure chemical over smoking it.

	My experiences and those of others point to the fact that the
subjective effects of tryptamines vary markedly with the route of
absorbtion. While smoking often results in overwhelming experiences it
is possible to have more psylocibin like effects by snorting or eating
small amounts in conjunction with P harmala seeds. It seems also that
5-MeO-DMT and DMT, whose effects differ considerably when smoked, seem
to "converge" in subjective effects when taken orally. I wonder if
other knowledgeable people on the net could substanciate that last
claim.

	Of all the psychedelics, short acting tryptamines seem to have
the most non linear dose-responses curve. Taking twice a barely active
dose will often result in an intense experience! That is the reason
why you should be very careful when taking them orally.

	I recently found a very interesting and potentially safer way
to use 5-MeO-DMT. The key is to dissolve it in distilled water and put
the solution in one of those nose spray bottles in such a way that
each inhalation will dispense about 3-4 mg (Don't screw up there!).
When taken as a nose spray the effects come on more slowly than smoked
(about 1 min. instead of a few sec.) and the effect is more spread out
in time. The nice thing is that it is possible to very accurately
control the dose, which makes the trip a lot more manageable. Taken in
that manner, the effect can be fairly similar to psilocybin, with the
advantage that it is possible to come down within half an hour. I
guess this method could be used with DMT, but you would probably have
to convert the base into a salt (for higher solubility) since you need a
10x higher concentration of DMT in the solution.

In his book Pharmacotheon, Jonathan Ott mentions experiments in which
he extracted the alkaloids via boiling water. In fact, I think he may
have just strained hot water through the finely ground material, like 
making coffee. He did this in order to mix it with an MAOI (harmala
seeds) for oral ingestion. I believe he goes into much more detail in
his latest book, Ayahuasca Analogs. 

Can anybody comment on the viability of this technique? It does seem
even easier than the acid-base extracion, although of course it would
not yield the smokable freebase.

Yes. It contains some DMT, but not very much. Someone told me the other 
day that a friend of theirs that is investigating this (solicited samples 
from interested parties, and used thin layer chromatography to assay the 
root stocks, from what I was told) says there's "little or no DMT" in 
Arundo donax rhizomes. 

The paper that first found DMT and a few other indole alkaloids in Arundo 
donax (Ghosal) working in India (River Reed is used in Ayurvedic 
medicine) also found only trace amounts. You'd have to extract several 
kilograms to get a psychoactive dose of DMT. There are also several 
cardioactive glycosides and other substances that would produce annoying 
side effects if a crude extract were consumed - the effect of Arundo 
donax extract on heart muscle (another paper by Ghosal et. al.) gave me 
the impression that crude Arundo extracts are potentially dangerous.
You'd have to resort to solvent extraction followed by column 
chromatography to extract pure DMT from the roots - a process probably 
requiring several liters of solvent just to produce one dose of DMT.

I'll shell to DOS here and see if I can find my notes about Arundo 
donax...

 I think it's usually spelled "Yage" pronounced Yah-hey.

See the books "Wizard of the Amazon" and "Rio Tigre" by the late Doctor 
Bruce Lamb of Santa Fe NM. (Bruce died during the Christmas Holiday 
season of 1992). These are the best resources on the subject and are 
written by a fine scientist who tried Ayahuasca and found it to be of 
great value.
