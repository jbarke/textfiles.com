     For more than 100 years the Moroccan government has allowed (ignored) kif
cultivation near the pine-covered crest of the otherwise barren Rif Mountains,
in a limited area closely surrounding the village of Ketama. However, the
industry has grown in the past 10 years and farms now nearly cover all the upper
mountain ranges and much lowland as far as 75 miles from the once quiet Ketama.
Fifteen years ago less than 500 sqaure miles were under hashish cultivation.
Before hashish cultivation, kif cultivation used only approximatly 500 sqware
miles. Now, cultivation covers 10,000 square miles and nearly every terraced
field with a source of water is filled with kif plants from spring to late
summer. Hashish is the only major product of the region and it is one of the
only crops that will grow here. If the incredible tonnage of hashish produced
and its comparatively high wholesale market value are used as indicators, it
appears that hashish must be Morocco's number one export.
     
     Most of the kif is harvested in late July and early August when the
weather turns hottest and driest. The plants change from medium green to golden
yellow as they begin to wilt and die in the baking sun. Some plants in well
irrigated fields remain green longer and are left until mid-September. Moroccan
farmers don't wait for the resin to build up on the flowers like sinsemilla
farmers do. All of these plants are completely seeded. Rather, the Moroccan
farmer decided to harvest when the plants run out of water and begin to die.
The longer the water holds out, the longer the plants have to mature, and the
more potent the resins become andf the taller the plants. Unfortunatly, chemical
fertilizers are now commonly and extensivly used to increase yield on exhausted
land and absolutly every farmer agrees that chemical fertilizers produce
inferior taste, smell and high, and are not as sticky either. Now that farmers
are only growing for resin and are not growing the whole plant for kif, the
genetics are rapidly declining. Now, unselected seeds from inferior plants are
what everyone uses for planting. Old time kif farmers had a close personal
relationship with thier crops when they were growing for flowers and not just
for resin.
     
     The single stalks from one to eight feet in lenght are bundled for
transport to the home compund where they are laid on hot tin roofs to dry in the
sun for about 5 days. After they are fairly crisp the bundles are stacked in the
cool shade inside of thier homes and stored for one to six months until the
resins are collected for hashish production. Dry weight yield for plants is
approximatly 10 grams per square foot, 100 grams per sqaure meter.
     
     Resin collection is very simply performed by stretching a single layer of
nylon scarf material across the mouth of a large plastic wash tub. The entire
plants are covered with a sheet of plastic and flailed with a stick over the
tub. The large stems are thrown away and the crushed plant material is rubbed
back and forth across the cloth sieve. The coarse plant debris stays behind
while the resin glands, powdered plant material, dust and dirt falls through the
seieve and is collected in the wash tub. The harder and longer the plant
material is rubbed on the screen, the more plant material goes through with the
resin, This process is repeated over and over up to a dozen times until nothing
but powdered green leaf is coming through the sieve. The first and second
extractions are mostly resin while the subsequent batches are mostly debris.
The Moroccans can market slmost any quality of hashish and no resin is wasted
as you shall see.

     The first two or three sievings are combined to produce the best
commercial grade of Moroccan hashish known as "Zero-Zero." the yield from 100
kilos of dried kif plants is approximatly 2 to 3 kilos (or 2,000 to 3,000 grams)
of "Zero-Zero" quality hashish. This quality is rarely available on the export
market ans is usually the BEST quality you will be offered in Morocco. Although,
with diligent hunting in the farming area it is possible to find higher quality
(70 to 1000 grams from 100 kilos dry plants), but only in small quantities of
less than 100 grams. Most exported comercial quality is 5 to 10 kilos hashish
from 100 kilos of dried plant. We wouldn't smoke it.

     However, the vast majority of hashish exported from Morocco and found
across Europe is manufactured from the lower grades of green leafy resin powder.
Binders are used to make the low grade powder sticky so it can be pressed
together to look like real nice dark hashish. These sorts of practices are also
carried out in the Afghan-Pakistani border region, another major supplier of
hashish to Europe. Binders include butter, bananas, pine tar, plant gums,
sweetened condensed milk, henna, motor oil, and worst of all, paraffin wax. Up
to 10% of the weight of commercial hashish can be accounted for by binders such
as wax. Wax helps poor quality resins stick together like good resin would, and
when a match is put to it, will keep a flame like superior hashish would. Who
knows what smoking petrolum wax does to your lungs, but it can't be good for
you! The idea behind making hashish is to get a stronger, cleaner smoke so you
consume less impurities, and smoke less in total, than by using crude Marijuana.
Adding adulterants defeats the purpose, decieves the public, and endangers
health.

     A fairly high grade of hashish can be produced from seedy Morrocan kif,
but only by rigorusly performing the proper techniques as first taught to the
Moroccans by Mustafa the Algerian. First selected superior plants must be
cleaned of all leaf to remove any potential impurities. The leaves dont have any
resin on them anyways and are covered with dust. Then while working over the
sieve the flowering tops are carefully stripped deom the stems are crushed
without reducing the to powder. The resin heads are shaken through the cloth by
slapping the sides of the plastic tub, but the cloth is never touched nor the
flowers rubbed across it. After shaking, the crushed flowers are dumped to the
side not brushed off by hand which pushed debris through the screen. These
crushed flowers are saved for later comercial extraction and another portion of
flowers is gingerly crushed over the sieve. Only the resin glands and fine dust
flass through the cloth and is collected from the bottom of the tub. This
already potent can be further cleaned by lightly rubbing it across the top of a
double layer or slightly finer scarf material. This allows most of the fine dirt
and dust to fall though but few of the coarser resin heads. The resin remaining
on top of the sieve is nearly pure cannabis resin free of most of the dirt and
plant debris. Pure hashish as it was originally intended to be prepared, is
easily hard pressed into what the Moroccans call chewing gum.

     Before resin glands can be smoked the must be pressed into a piece of
hashish. The Moroccans use hydraulic jacks to press 250 grams comercial pieces.
"Zero-Zero" powder is simply poured into a cellophane bag and lightly squeezed
with the press, since it is naturally sticky enough to stay together. This
produces a yellowish blonde slab. The very best pieces can be hand pressed with
difficulty. The resins are very dry from baking in the sun so they are not as
easily to press as higher grade shade-dried resins.

     Lower grade powders are mixed with adulterants and binders, heated, and
hammer beaten to blend the ingredients thoroughly before they are squeezed into
molds under high pressure. A dark reddish to deep brown slab of Modern Morrocan
is the result, ready for export. Most smokers assume what they are smoking is
clean hashish free from impurities. In fact, most of it is tainted. The hashish
manufactures are crafty and it is difficult for the average smoker to detect
adulterants in hashish. Kif mixed with tobacco is smoked one hit at a time in a
long wooden-stemmed sibsi pipe with a small red clay bowl. Hashish is smoked in
the same fashion. However, we rolled thumb diameter joints with three to five
grams of the best (Personally made "Zero-Zero-Zero-Zero") on a cardboard filter.
This allowed much faster consumtion and provided the rushes we traveled
thousands of miles to enjoy. 

     While commerical techniques yield more than 300 grams of mediocre hashish
per 100 kilos of kif, traditional hashish techniques yield only 100 to 200 grams
of super clean and pure hashish. Because it is twice as good as thier best, we
call it "Zero-Zero-Zero-Zero."

     As an experiment we had 100 kilos of whole, dried Moroccan plants
completely maicured and cleaned to various components. The breakdown was:

     15 kilos leaf
     20 kilos stem
     50 kilos seed
     15 kilos flower

     In morocco, 100 kilos dried plants is really only 15 kilos flowers and
farmers extract up to 5 to 10 kilos of so-called resin. No wonder the resin
needs help to stick together! American improved varieties such as Skunk #1 can
yield up to 70 kilos of pure flowers from 100 kilos of dried plant. There is
much more resin and the resins can be sinsemilla resins with little dirt or
dust. That's five to ten times the weight in resin! The older farmers remember
how to make fine hashish but they cannot get a high enough price for it to make
it worthwhile to produce. It just isnt worth the twenty to thirty times the
price to enough connoisseur smokers. The moroccans make much more money by
selling lesser quality product.

     the only answer to this dilemma is to make your own hashish. Most smokers
can't take the time to travel to the third world in search of inexpensive
marijuana as a source for thier own pieces of hashish. However, along with the
burgeoning marijuana cultivating industry comes a ready supply of high-grade
domestically grown cannabis with resin suitble for making hashish. Outdoor
plants, greenhouse plants, and artifical light plants can all be utilized to
make high grade hashish.
     
     
Ending Note:  Place silkscreen under your work area while you manicure, package,
and roll doobies. A piece of black plexiglass or a mirror under the screen makes
collecting the separated resins easy with a credit card. Correct screen size is
43 threads to the centimeter, 100-120 to the inch, for most domestically grown
resin heads. Moroccan because of smaller resin heads requires 60-80 to the
centimeter, 150-200 to the inch. Also, Zero-Zero orginally got its name from the
hole size of the silk fabric that was the finest, "00."
