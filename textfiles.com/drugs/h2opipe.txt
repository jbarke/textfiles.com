Re: Wicked water pipe
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ok peoples, here's a quick, and handy speech on creating a very effective
water-pipe out of a few household items.

Supplies needed:

  Coke Can
  3 Screw-on bottle-caps
  Screen (grab it outta yer tap)
  Pen Tube (use a clear one for trippiest results)
  Metal tube about 5 inches long (the tube off a tire-gage is what I used)
  Electrical tape, and rubber sealent (Silicone Seal) <-- optional


     For those of you who don't know the concept behind the water-pipe.
It works like this.. You got your metal tube running from the bowl, at the top
of the can, to the bottom, where the can is about 1/4 filled with chilled
water, (or beer works even better!) and then ya got your pen tube for a
mouthpiece. When you spark a bowl, and suck on the mouth-piece, the smoke goes
from the bowl, through the metal tube, through the water, then up through the
pen-tube (which of course isn't submerged in the water.. It's about an inch &
1/2 above the water-line. The result.. cool tokes, no more burning throat, or
hash coughs :)


Step 1:

  First we must construct the bowl. Take a knife, and neatly punch a small hole
through 1 of the bottle-caps. This is for the metal tube to fit through, so
make the diameter of the hole appropriate for it. Next, stick the metal tube
through the top side of the cap, so it protrudes out about a 1/2 centimeter
from the inside of the cap. It should have a snug fit.
  Next, take the other two caps, and cut a hole in each of them, from the TOP
of the cap. This will be for the screen.

                         _______
                         [     ]   <-- the actual bowl.
                         [_____]              (cap is up-side-down)
           Screen  -->   [     ]   <-- secondary chamber
(fitting between caps)   [_____]              (cap is right-side up)
                         [     ]   <-- intake chamber
                         [_____]              (cap is up-side down)
          Metal tube  -->  | |
    (plastic would melt!)  | |

  Start with the intake, and secondary chambers. See the little bottle-cap
tabs on em? Well, take four of those off each cap, then interlock them
together. Put the screen on the hole of the secondary chamber, then put the
bowl on top of that, and tape it all together.

Step 2:

  Now, on to the actual pipe part of it. By this time, you should have the bowl
done (which by the way is the hardest part) Take your can, and pull off it's
tab too, NEATLY! You want to have the sippin' hole nice and undamaged if you
wanna have a snuggly fitting bowl mechanism. Take your knife, and cut a small
hole in the top of the can, opposite the sippin hole, this is for the
mouthpiece. (pen)

  Ok. so you should have your bowl thingy done, and it should be inside the
can, make sure the intake chamber is flush against the top of the can. Got your
mouthpiece hole drilled? Ok. Stick the pen in that hole, so it's angled out,
and away from the bowl (so you don't get your hair torched when you try to use
this thing) Now tape the whole thing up so it's airtight, and the last thing..
The carb. Punch a hole in the side of the can opposite the mouth- piece about
3/4 up the can. This is the carb. When you'r almost finished your toke, take
your finger off this hole, to get all the smoke that was left inside the can.
Gets ya totally baked. This hole is also useful for filling up the pipe :)
