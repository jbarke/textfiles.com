My ÿThanx ÿgo ÿout ÿto ÿSkate ÿBasher ÿand ÿTas ÿfor ÿthe ÿcritical 
development that went into this marvel.

Materials Needed: 1 Coke Bottle (2 litre variety)
                  2 Bottle Caps
                  2 Bic Pens
                  1 Glass Tube  (This Can Be picked up at either 
                                Capital Iron or any scientific
                                warehouse)
                  1 Screen (please refer to the text file
                            "SCREENS.TXT" for more info on how
                            to make your own homemade screens) 
                  A Glue-Gun, or Electrical Tape.                 

Directions 
----------
 
1. Take the Coke Bottle.  Punch a hole about an inch down from
   the bottom of the neck of the bottle.  Do the same to the
   exact opposite side of the bottle. 

2. Take a bottle cap and knock a hole in the centre of it. The
   glass tube should have a snug fit. 

3. Take the other bottle cap and put a slightly larger hole in
   it.  The hole should be big enough to fit a screen in it.

4. Take both bottle caps and interlock the little metal flaps
   (otherwise known as the safety tester).  Tape the connection
   to seal it up. 

5. Now take the screen and cup it around the end of one of the 
   pens. Insert it into the cap described in step 3. 

6. Take a pen, and insert it in the other tube. 

7. Tape, or seal both tubes together. 

8. In one of the holes, insert the other bic pen and seal the
   connection on the bottle.

9. Fill the bottle 3/4 of the way up with water or whatever
   fluid works best. 

A. Stick your cap contraption in the neck of the bottle and
   seal this connection.

Notes
-----

This project should work just like a water pipe should work. When 
adding fluid, try using either a single malt scotch, or for those 
who  can't  afford  such  things (I know the feeling), a red wine 
does the trick.  If you need any more questions, please E-Mail me 
on the above mentioned system.  Maybe if I ever did get the energy 
I would put up a drug-related system, but THC does fine!

When using the pipe..

        What-ever you do.. ÿDon't blow into the mouth-piece! ÿThis 
will ÿobviously ÿflood the bowl, ÿand waste any smoke you ÿhad ÿin 
there.. ÿÿCover ÿthe ÿcarb with a finger, ÿand ÿsmoke ÿyour ÿbowl, 
flooding the chamber, ÿthen un-cover the carb, ÿand toke the smoke 
trapped in the bottle. ÿEmptying the bowl when your done? Well, ÿI 
guess ya gotta figure out that one for yourself.

Some interesting news I heard.  If you ever decide to buy off the 
street, be very careful.  It's one big heat score, and I know of 
one dealer who actually did get snagged.  Luckally, he wasn't 
carrying at the time!

Quote of the phile "Never decide to type up these files when
                    under the influence; reading them the next
                    day can be interesting, to say the least!"
