Various paragraphs from the PDR regarding various brands of Yohimbine:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Yohimbine is an indolealkylamine alkaloid [this is the same group that
includes Psilocybin] with chemical similarity to
reserpine. It is the principal alkaloid of the bark of the West African
'Corynanthe yohimbe' tree and is aslo found in Rauwolfia Serpentina.

"... causes erectile stimulation without increasing sexual desire."

OVERDOSAGE: Daily doses of 20-30mg may produce increases in heart rate and
blood pressure, piloerection [hair stands on end/goosebumps] and rhinorrhea
[runny nose]. More severe symptoms may include paresthesias [local numbness],
incoordination, tremulousness and a DISSOCIATIVE STATE [spaced-out dreamlike
feeling of unreality] with higher doses.

WARNING: Generally this drug is not proposed for use in females and certainly
must not be used during pregnancy. Neither is this drug proposed for use in
pediatric, geriatric, or cardio-renal patients with gastric or duodenal ulcer
history. Nor should it be used in conjunction with mood altering drugs such
as antidepressants, or in psychiatric patients in general.

ADVERSE REACTIONS: Yohimbine readily penetrates the CNS and produces a
complex pattern of responses at lower doses than required to produce
alpha-adrenergic blockade. These include antiduresis [reduced urination] a
general picture of central excitation including elevation of blood pressure
and heart rate increased motor activity, irritability and tremor. Sweating
nausea and vomiting are common after parenteral [not by digestion]
administration of the drug. Also dizzyness, headache, skin flushing reported
when used orally.

"Yohimbine blocks presynaptic alpha-2-adrenergic receptors. It's action on
peripheral blood vessels resembles that of reserpine, though it is weaker and
of short duration. Yohimbine's peripheral autonomic nervous system effect is
to increase parasympathetic (cholinergic) and decrease sympathetic
(adrenergic) activity.

...

Yohimbine exerts a stimulating action on the mood and may increase anxiety.
Such actions have not been adequately studied or related to dosage. Although
they appear to require hight doses of the drug. Yohimbine has a mild
anti-diuretic action, probably via stimulation of hypothalamic centers and
release of posterior pituitary hormone.

Reportedly, Yohimbine exerts no significant influence on cardiac stimulation
and other effects mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors, its effect on blood
pressure, if any, would be to lower it; however, no adequate studies are at
hand to quantitate this effect in terms of Yohimbine dosage.

YOCON is indicated as a sympathicolytic and mydriatic. It may have activity
as an aphrodisiac.
