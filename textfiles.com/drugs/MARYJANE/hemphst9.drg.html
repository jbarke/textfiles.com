                        HEMP AND FLAX MACHINE.

    The Machine for breaking Hemp and Flax, either rotted or unrotted, invented
by Joseph Hines, and William Bain, (the right of using which, is secured to
them by patent,) may be seen at Stillwater Village, Saratoga county, New-York,
where it has been in successful operation since the last season.  This
laborsaving machine surpasses any yet offered to the public for the purpose
intended, not only in America, but it is believed throughout the world.  It is
so constructed as to operate one hundred and twelve times on every inch of the
stem; and when running at full speed, rising of two hundred thousand flutes
operate on hemp or flax per minute, in sufficient force to crack and dislodge
the stem, and at the same time preserve unimpared the coat or fibre.  When well
tended the Machine will break three hundred weight of hemp or flax in an hour. 
The Machine in this village is driven by steam power; and the shives which are
made in breaking hemp serve as fuel both for the engine and drying-house, in
all cases producing an excess of at least one half for other uses; thus saving
an expense to the proprietors of two cords of wood per day.  Experience has
proved that the shives may be used as fuel in distilling and for other steam
power to equal advantage.  This machine may be worked either by steam or water
power, as may best suit the convenience of those interested.

    Those who wish occular demonstration of the correctness of this statement,
are desired to call and examine for themselves.  All persons are forbid using
this Machine without license from the patentees.  The subscriber offers for
sale the right to use the machine in any territory of the United States, not
before sold on reasonable terms.  Communications in writing, post-paid, will be
promptly attended to.*
                                               JOSEPH HINES.

Stillwater Village, July 12th, 1828.

*  E. & T. FAIRBANKS of St. Johnsbury, and Col. ELLIS COBB of Barton are
appointed agents for vending the right to use this machine in the Counties of
Orange, Washington, Caledonia and Essex in Vermont.

    Since it has been ascertained by experiment that Hemp and flax can be
divested of its glutenous or vegetable substance, after breaking with less
expense and greater safety than before, by the simple use of water -- the above
machine is increased in value, to the public and those engaged in the culture
and manufacture of hemp or flax -- inasmuch as these important articles of
American growth and consumption, can now be manufactured at home of as good a
quality, and at a much less expense than in any other country.  The undersigned
have fully tested this newly discovered and highly improved mode of rotting and
cleaning hemp and flax; and with confidence recommend its adoption to the
public.  Three days immersion in still or running water is sufficient to
cleanse the fibre of its vegetable substance.  After which it will only require
to be dried in the sun, or the drying house; and again run through the machine,
to render it ductile and fit for use.  Any information respecting this process,
or the use of the Machine, as well as the culture or manufacture of hemp or
flax, will be readily imparted on application to the subscribers, or either of
them.

                                        JAS. W. STRANAHAN,
                                        S. P. HINES.
Stillwater Village, July 12th, 1828.

    The following certificates from Messrs. Cookes of Ohio will be read with
interest, as they are gentlemen of extensive acquaintance, highly respected for
their intelligence and practical knowledge in agriculture, particularly in
culture and manufacture of hemp.  One of them has been a member of the
Legislature of that state, and the other is, and has long bee, Post-Master of
the village in which he resides, and extensively engaged in mercantile and
agricultural pursuits:--

    "We hereby certify that in the autumn of 1824, we established in Huron
County Ohio, one of Mr. Hines' Machines, (called Hines and Bain's Machine for
breaking flax and hemp,) and that since that period we have kept the same in
constant and profitable operation.

    There have been several machines, made in that country, embracing in part
the same principle, but varying in their construction from that of Mr. Hines,
in order to evade his patent; all of which have proved unprofitable to the
owners, and highly injurious to the general character of hemp prepared by
machinery. -- We have observed these failures and attempts at evasion with
regret; and having thoroughly tested, by long experience and observation, the
decided superiority and preeminent practical utility of Mr. Hines' Machine,
compared with others, we are fully satisfied, that it is altogether the most
perfect Machine for the purpose now in operation.  And we are equally well
satisfied, from much observation and reflection upon the principles of its
operation, and the nature of the plan upon which it is designed, to operate
that no other machine different from his is principle can ever be invented, to
supersede it.

    An experience of four years has confirmed us in the opinion we had long
entertained, that there is no branch of agriculture that will afford as great a
profit, or contribute so vastly to advance the wealth and prosperity of the
country, as that of the culture of hemp, aided by said Machine, and that
without such aid the great labor and expense of preparing it for market, would
continue, (as heretofore) to discourage its cultivation.  We are therefore,
clearly convinced that the invention and introduction of this Machine by Mr.
Hines, in a national point of view, will ultimately confer the most lasting and
important benefits upon his country, and, at no distant day be looked upon as
constituting the brightest Era in the history of American Agriculture.  So far
as we are individually concerned, Mr. Hines has our most sincere thanks for the
very great benefits we have received through his improvement, and whatever may
be the pecuniary rewards of his enterprise, they can never equal the fame which
awaits him at the hands of his country."

                                            E. & E. COOKE.

                        Four Corners, Huron Co. Ohio, June 20, 1828.
                                    STILLWATER, August 7th, 1828.

P.S.  I have this day seen and examined Mr. Hines' Machine, now in operation,
by steam power, at Stillwater, Saratoga Co. New York.  The only fuel used, is
the shives it makes in breaking the hemp, only one half of which is required to
keep it in constant operation.  It performs its work with great facility, and
in my opinion, the heat after creating the steam, by passing through a flue
nearly horizontal, will be fully sufficient for a dry-house.  I have also seen
samples of hemp that were broken in an unrotted state, and afterwards,
water-rotted, which I thing to be fully equal if not superior in quality to the
best of Russian Hemp.            E. COOKE.

    The following is an extract of a letter from Joel Buttles, Esq. 
Post-Master of Columbus, (Ohio) dated July 24, 1828, to Joseph Hines the
patentee on the subject of his machine for dressing hemp and flax: -- 

    "Thomas Carpenter's Machines turn out about as you predicted they would --
they do but little, and that but poorly,  There are other machines introduced
into the northern part of this state, none of which do well.  I sold one of
your machines last week, to put up on Huron River, instead of one which had
been in use for some time (the kind I do not now recollect.)  The purchaser
said his would clean hemp and flax -- still he is willing, it would seem, to
throw it by, and purchase yours with the right to use it, and be at the expense
of transporting it one hundred and twenty miles by land.  There have been a
great many machines tried here, but none of them answer the expectation, or
recommendation, nor does any one of them clean near as well, or as fast as
yours."

    The following is an extract of a letter from Joseph Hines, Esq. the
patentee of the only Hemp machine in successful operation in the United States,
to the Editor, under date of 20th August.--

    "Samples of Duck, manufactured from Hemp rotted in our newly discovered
mode, may be see here next week.  The principal of the factory informs us that
our hemp works finely, and it will make duck of a better quality than the best
of flax.  This too is hemp you must know that stood for the seed to get ripe. 
We have commenced making Bale-Rope."
