    The future prospects of a Market.--  On this subject most of my
correspondents have the same means of judging that I possess.  My opinion is,
that if the present tariff continues, (of which I have very little doubt) the
present price will be fully maintained for a number of years at least.  The
increased quantity grown in the Untied States will fall far short of the
increased consumption and the decrease of importation.  Notwithstanding the
high duty to which this article is subject, I anticipate large importations for
several years.  It must be so; the demands of our country absolutely require
it.  considerable exertions were made in this State last season to grow hemp,
and some feared the market would shortly be overstocked in consequence.  To
such, I can say, without fear of contradiction, that all hemp raised in Vermont
would not be sufficient to fit out two of our ships of the line with canvass
and cordage, or even to furnish two of our sister States with bale rope and
bagging to pack their cotton.  Canvass and cordage are perishable articles.  I
consider it fair to conclude there is no danger of the price declining for many
years to come.  Russia, from whom we have received our principal supplies, has
enough to do just now without growing hemp for us.

    In reply to the enquiries respecting the operation and expense of the Hemp
Machine, erected at this place, I have to remark, it equals the most sanguine
expectations of the proprietors.  In the commencement, many doubts and strong
prejudices existed unfavorable to its successful operation. -- The simplicity
of its mechanism and six months experience of its operation have satisfied me
that no great improvement can rationally be expected in the manner of dressing
hemp and flax.  Several enterprizing citizens are now engaged in attempting
improvements upon Hines' machine.  I heartily wish them a rich reward for their
praiseworthy motives and labor; but have no confidence in their success.  Some
improvements in the construction of certain parts of the machinery, and useful
additions, may be expected; but in my opinion none can reasonably be
anticipated in the principle.  Many of our ingenious and most worthy mechanics
frequently lose sight of some of the first and most important principles of
mechanism.  They should always remember, that one pound cannot be made to
outweigh two, -- that weight will find its balance, and all increase of motion
is at least an equal loss of power.

    In regard to the quantity and price of hemp seed in this vicinity, I can
only say, that a few hundred bushels might at this time be obtained at $4 per
bushel.  I think it probable the price will advance soon after the opening of
navigation.

    I presume the tedious length of this communication will be considered a
sufficient apology for my omitting a reply to other inquiries of my
correspondents.  To several of them, nothing short of experience can give the
information sought for.
                                    Yours, respectfully,
                                             A. W. BARNUM.
    Vergennes, April, 1829.

    By the report of the Commissioners of the Navy to Congress, on the subject
of Hemp, it appears that experiments have been made to ascertain the quality of
American water-rotted hemp, compared with Russian hemp.  The American hemp,
before spun into yarn, was found the strongest, and after made into cordage and
tested on board of ships, its strength and durability were ascertained to be
fully equal to cordage made of Russian hemp similarly exposed, and if there is
any difference between the best American and the best Russian water-rotted hemp
when bro't to our market, the Commissioners unhesitatingly say it is in favor
of the former.  The Commissioners say, they never have entertained a doubt of
American water-rotted hemp being equal to Russian hemp.  Cordage made of
American dew-rotted hemp, after a year's wear, was found inferior to Russia
rope, which had been use the same length of time.

    One reason why American hemp has been esteemed inferior to the Russian
arises from the imperfect mode of curing.  The gummy or glutinous substance not
being sufficiently cleared away, the tar does not penetrate the fibres equally,
and by use the cordage is liable to become loose and spongy.  But it is
confidently believed that hemp, dressed by the Hemp and Flax Machine, and
afterwards immersed in water and exposed to the action of frost, will be free
from the gluten complained of.

    Hemp is considered a very hardy plant, resists drought and severe frost, is
easier cultivated, less exhausting, and more profitable than many other
vegetable crops.  It may be grown year after year on the same ground, well
manured, and has been cropped from the same ground in England seventy years in
succession.  The usual quantity of seed sown on an acre of middling land,
should be two bushels to the acre, and on very rich ground three bushels. 
Early sowing renders the coat heavier and stronger, the growth being early
shades the soil and preserves the moisture.  The seed having been sown as even
as possible, should be well harrowed, and a roller or bush passed over to
smooth and level the ground, so that the hemp may be cut close to the roots.
When sown early it may be cut about the first of August; the time will be
indicated by the blossom stalks becoming yellow-spotted, and dropping the
leaves; and when the wind is still, a cloud of dust from blossom stalks or make
hemp will be seen to hang over the field.  If allowed to stand longer, the
stalks of the male hemp wither, become dark-colored, and the coat will be of
little value.  The way to secure seed for the succeeding year, is to sow a
patch thinly for that purpose, at the rate of half to three-fourths of a bushel
to the acre, but the better way is to sow in drills or rows.  Cutting is
preferable to pulling; a man will cut from half to an acre per day, but can
pull only about hone fourth of an acre; and cut hemp will bring more by the ton
than pulled.  In gathering the hemp, it should be sorted into long and short. 
Fine and soft hemp is the best; the American is frequently the reverse, owing
to the seed being sowed too sparingly.

    It is said that the usual mode of water-rotting on Connecticut River is
very imperfect.

    It is found that the crop of hemp varies according to the richness of the
soil, a quantity of seed sown, gathering, rotting and dressing.  Some estimate
an average crop per acre by water-rotting in America at 400 lbs. (others say
500 to 800 lbs.) in England 650 lbs, in Russia 500 lbs. but it is acknowledged
that hemp dressed by the improved machines, yields a much larger quantity.

                   [Letter from Hon. Henry Clay.]

    The following letter from Mr. Clay, addressed to a gentleman in the state
of New York, who is extensively engaged in growing hemp, will show the
importance which is attached to it, by that distinguished individual;

                                    Washington December 29th, 1829.

    DEAR SIR.-- I received a letter the 17th ult. with the two specimens of
hemp enclosed, prepared according to the new method.  I am greatly obliged by
your kind attention to the request of Mr. Slade, and thank you for the valuable
information communicated in your letter.  The article of hemp is very
extensively cultivated in that part of Kentucky in which I reside, and it has
been an object of anxious enquiry and experiment, to discover some mode of
breaking hemp, that should diminish the severe labor, incident to the old
process.  Mr. Swider, formerly of your state, a most enterprising and
intelligent gentleman, has been engaged six or seven years in Kengtucky, in
devising some plan which should accomplish that object. Although his exertions
have not been crowned with all the success which they merit, he still
perseveres, and hopes ultimately to overcome all obstacles.  More than five
years ago a machine was erected on my farm, to break out hemp prior to rotting
it; it did not yield a quantity of net hemp proportionate to the force which
was employed; but I nevertheless was able to have several tons cleaned and
prepared.  The article produced was very sightly and beautiful.  

One ton was manufactured into rigging for the North-Carolina 74, prior to her
late voyage to the Mediterranean.  Upon her return her rigging looked well in
its external appearance, but on subjecting it to an analysis, it was discovered
that the interior part of the cordage was in a state of decay, resembling the
rot in the wood.  I considered that experiment as decisive against the use of
the article when not submitted to the action of water, as that had not been;
but I cannot perceive any reason why the hemp should not be as good when it is
rotted after separating the lint from the stalk, as if both were rotted
together.  The new method therefore which is practised in your neighborhood
must answer all the purposes of the old, whilst it has the strong
recommendation, of essentially diminishing labor.  Mr. Smider has prepared hemp
in the same way, but I am not informed as to the degree of success he has had. 
Upon my return to Kentucky in the spring, I mean to make the preparation of
hemp an object of particular enquiry and attention; and if I should obtain any
information worth communicating to you, I will take pleasure in transmitting it
in compliance with your request.  I should be glad to be made acquainted with
the price of the machine constructed under the patent of Messrs. Hines & Bain,
and what I could get one delivered at upon my farm near Lexington, to be paid
for on the delivery, & after it was ascertained upon experiment that it would
answer its intended purpose.  I am with great respect, your ob't serv't.

    ADONIJAH EMMONS, ESQ.                               H.CLAY.
