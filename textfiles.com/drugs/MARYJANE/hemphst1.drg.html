                               BY E. FAIRBANKS.

                                St. Johnsbury:
                    printed at The Farmer's Herald Office,
                             by Jewett and Porter
                                -!!!!!!!!!!!!-

                                   PREFACE

    Although the following Articles have most of them been before the public,
very few, it is believed, gave them at the time of publication, that attention
which their importance deserved; and many who NOW feel a deep interest upon the
subject, have not the means of readily obtaining the information they desire.

    The attention of the Agriculture Public has of late been much excited in
relation to the culture of HEMP, but there are few whose EXPERIENCE enables
them to engage in the business with confidence of success.

    The information contained in the articles here selected is valuable,
embracing the result of experiments relating to the adaptation of our soil and
climate to the growing of Hemp -- the method of preparing the Land -- the time
and manner of Sowing and Harvesting -- preparation for the Market, & c., &c.
These articles have been cut from different Newspapers, without any view to the
present compilation, some of them are unavoidably inserted without giving
credit to the Authors; but those embracing the most important information are
under the signature of Gentlemen well known, and whose integrity and judgment
entitle their communications to the highest confidence.

    The insulated situation particularly of the Northern and Middle sections of
Vermont, must for a long time to come, render most kinds of surplus produce of
comparatively little value. hemp will be an exception -- And it is believed
that no country, for soil and climate is better adapted to its culture. Aware
of the importance of this branch of Agriculture, a respectable proportion of
the Farmers in Franklin, Orleans and Caledonia counties have commence the
business with a spirit and enterprise much to their credit.  Establishments for
cleaning it are in a state of forwardness at Barton, in Orleans County,
Hardwick, in Caledonia County, and Waterville, in Franklin county; and one of
Hines & Bain's Machines will be put in operation in each of those places the
present season. At St. Johnsbury in Caledonia County, a Company has recently
been formed for the purpose of putting one in operation early next Summer.

    These Machines are built at St. Johnsbury, by E. & T. Fairbanks, and
warranted good.

    The following facts from the letter of the Secretary of the Treasury,
transmitting statements of the imports and exports of the U. States for the
year ending 30th Sept. 1828, will illustrate in some measure the extent of the
market for hemp. It should be remembered that "the articles imported into the
United States, are in all cases valued at their actual cost, or the value which
they sustain in the foreign port from whence they are imported into the United
States, are in all cases valued at their actual cost, or the value which they
sustain in the foreign port from whence they are imported into the U. States,
free of any subsequent charge whatever." The aggregate, therefore, paid in our
ports for hemp and flax, and for manufactures of hemp and flax, may be safely
estimated at Ten Millions of Dollars, annually.

    It is a rational presumption that the consumption of hemp will be greatly
increased; not only from the consideration of an increased population, but from
the fact that the recent improvements in spinning and manufacturing it will
render hempen goods a cheap and comfortable article for domestic use --
superseding in great measure the use of cotton sheetings and shirtings in the
Northern States -- and probably, at no distant period, a profitable article for
exportation. It may not be improper here to remark, that of the article entered
as "Linens", a large proportion of those not exceeding fifty cents per yard,
are manufactured from hemp.
