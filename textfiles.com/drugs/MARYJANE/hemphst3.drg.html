                      [FROM THE BURLINGTON FREE PRESS.]

    Experience has already we believe quieted the fears entertained by some
that hemp was so exhausting a crop that nothing could be advantageously grown
on the land after it. Among other testimonies on this subject we select from
the Bellows Falls' Intelligencer the following statement of Mr. Amos Parker, a
practical and experienced farmer of Springfield in this State.

    Springfield, Oct. 10.  Sir -- In answer to the questions you have been
pleased to ask in relation to the culture of hemp, &c. I can briefly remark,
that during the years 1813, 14 and 15, I sowed upon my farm about one acre of
hemp; it was sowed upon what is termed meadow land, upon the Connecticut river,
and was continued upon the same piece of land, three years successively. --
There appeared to be no essential difference in the several crops, either as to
quality or quantity. It may be proper to remark, that during this time no
manure was put upon the land. The great labor then required to water rot it in
the stem, rendered the growing of hemp, both expensive and burthensome, and
finally induced me to relinquish it altogether. From my own experience on the
subject. I am fully satisfied that a hemp crop, is not what would be called an
exhausting crop, but may be successfully and profitably cultivated on good
land, with the same attention that we usually bestow upon our grain and other
crops.

    Under this conviction, and the additional inducement of obtaining a market
for hemp without the process of the water rotting, which I superseded by a
newly invented machine for cleaning, I have engaged to plant a part of my land
the ensuing season for the purpose of raising a crop of seed, in order to be in
preparation to raise the lint the following season.

    I am, Sir &c.                           AMOS PARKER.

                       -!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-

             Letter from the Hon. Samuel Lathrop to the Editor of
                           the New England Farmer.

    Mr. J.B.Russel. -- I embrace the first moment of leisure, to give you, in
compliance with your request, an account of the method pursued by our farmers,
in the cultivation of hemp. It has been raised in my neighborhood for more than
twenty years. It is considered as a sure crop; and the price which it has borne
for a few years past, affords a reasonable remuneration to the cultivator. In
the account which I shall give, there will probably be nothing new or
instructive to those already acquainted with the prosesss. If you think it will
be useful to others you will make such use of it as you think proper.

    Hemp requires a deep and rich soil. -- Any attempt to raise it upon a light
soil, or upon land worn out and exhausted, until it is recruited by manure, and
a fertilizing course of husbandry, will result only in disappointment. Nor can
it long be continued upon the piece of ground, without an annual supply of
manure. But upon a good soil, with an annual sprinkling of manure, at the rate
of eight to ten loads to the acre, it may be continued for a succession of
years, without any material diminution in the value of the crop.

    The ground must be prepared for the seed, much in the same manner as for
flax. It must be ploughed and harrowed sufficiently to break the clods, and to
render the soil fine and mellow. As different degrees of labor produce this
effect, it must be left to the judgment of the cultivator to determine when his
ground is in a proper state to receive the seed. I can safely say, that few
farmers err, in ploughing and harrowing too much.

    The time for sowing is about the 10th of May. A few days earlier or later
will make no difference. It must not be so early as to expose the tender plant
to severe frosts, and if sown late in May, it will produce a light crop -- the
stalks will have a thin coat.

    The quantity of seed varies with the strength and condition of the ground.
Two bushels is the usual quantity sown upon an acre -- and this is generally
sufficient. Some have used more, and upon very strong land have gone as high as
three bushels. But I believe that few of our farmers have found their account
in using a greater quantity than that first named. When it exceeds that
quantity, the land must not only be strong but it must be reduced to a very
fine tilth.. Otherwise, when it comes to grow, there will be a great deal of
under-brush; that is, short spindling, coatless stalks, of no value, and which
will only be in the way, at the time of pulling. The seed is sown broad cast,
and bushed or harrowed in, like flax.

    No further attention to the crop is required until the season for pulling
and cutting. Although the latter mode of gathering is attended with less labor,
our farmers almost universally adopt the former, as the most profitable. This
commences about the 10th of August. The time of pulling is determined by the
appearance of the hemp. There are two kinds of hemp in every field,
distinguished by the names of the male and the female. The latter produces the
seed, the former the blossom and the farina. the male hemp has but a few
slender branches. when this has turned white, or a pale yellow, has shed its
leaves, and the farina has chiefly fallen off, then it is time to pull it. The
female hemp has more and stronger branches, and continues fresh and green until
the seed is ripe. It is common to leave patches or narrow strips, where the
seed hemp is most abundant, until the seed has ripened, which will be about a
month after the time of pulling; in which case, the economical farmer will pull
out the male hemp as far as it is practicable; for the fibres of the hemp that
stands in the field until the seed is ripe, are always stiff and harsh, and
will bring less in the market, than that which has been pulled at the proper
season.

    The pulling is a heavy job. One-fourth of an acre is considered as a day's
work, though expert hands will pull a third of an acre. No precaution is
necessary except to guard against breaking the stalks. The laborer gathers a
few stalks in his hands and pulls them up, and having repeated this three or
four times, he strikes the roots once or twice with his foot, in order to kick
off the dirt, then holding the whole loose in his hands, lets the roots drop on
the ground, for the purpose of making that end of his handful even. And in
spreading his hemp on the ground, he is careful to lay the butts straight and
true. This will greatly facilitate the labor of binding.

    Rain upon hemp after it is pulled, produces the same effect as upon mown
grass. It discolors it and injures its quality. It must therefore be suffered
to lie upon the ground no longer than it is necessary for its preservation. As
soon as it is sufficiently dried, which, in warm and drying weather, will be
after two days sun, it must be bound up in small bundles or sheaves. A little
rye straw is the cheapest and best thing for bands.  Let the band be put on
towards the middle, otherwise it would be difficult to bind close enough to
hold together, through all the subsequent handlings. Set up 15 to 20 bundles
together, well braced at the roots to admit a free circulation of air, and to
prevent from blowing over, and let it remain in this situation, until it is
cured sufficiently to put into a stack or under cover. This may be done, in
good weather, after two or three days. In the construction of the stack, great
pains must be taken, lest the rain should find a passage into it. It is safest
to put it under cover, either under sheds about the barn, or by erecting one
for the purpose.
