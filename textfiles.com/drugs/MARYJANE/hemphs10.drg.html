                         [From Niles' Register]

                          IMPORTANT INVENTION.

    The Editors of the New York Statesman have recently seen in operation in
that city a most ingenious and valuable machine for spinning flax and hemp,
invented by Dr. Bell and Mr. Dyer, two intelligent and highly respectable
gentlemen from New England.  The following is a description of this machine, as
far as the editors have been permitted to speak of it.

    "It is constructed on an entirely new principle, having no analogy to the
process for the cotton, woolen, worsted, or other manufacture.  The quality of
yarn produced is pronounced by competent judges, to surpass other linen upon
the present improved machinery, are superior to those wrought by hand.  The
size of the thread can be varied to any extent, from that of cambric to that of
the rope yarns used in the manufacture of cordage.  In the degree of velocity
its operation is limited only by the quickness which the spindle's fliers are
capable of supporting.

    The instrument now in operation produces about the same quantity of thread
pr. spindle, fineness being equal as the throstle spindle in cotton
manufacture.  The whole formation of the thread from dressed flax is complete
at one operation.  The material laid on the machine is wound upon the spools
ready for the loom, without the intervention of any assistance; the whole being
effected by the rotary motion communicated from drums.  Indeed all the motions
of the instrument are of a circular kind."

    In relation to its advantages the editors remark:  "So far as our
observation of knowledge extends, this invention is entirely original, and
nothing of the kind exists in the work-shops of the United States or Europe,
where fabrics from flax are entirely wrought by hand.  The manufacturers of
linen will now be placed upon the same ground and enjoy the same facilities as
cottons.  It has been estimated that upon moderate calculations two millions of
dollars may be saved annually to this country by the reduced expenses of linen
fabricks, effected by this invention.  If it be not introduced abroad, and
foreign prices thus diminished, the products of our own looms will supply our
markets and prevent importation from maintaining competition. -- Such is our
impression of the importance of this machine."

                    [From the Vergennes Aurora]

                        MANUFACTURE OF HEMP.

    The Spinning Machine erected here under the direction of an ingenious
English artist, opens a fair prospect for a home market of hemp and flax, for
the protection of American industry, by the exclusion of European linen
fabrics.  This curious piece of mechanism is so constructed that by first
separating the flax into small parcels it is then drawn out with a slack twist
and fitted upon spools which are removed and placed ready to receive a
compressure from several pairs of rollers, which is at last received upon the
flyers and is formed to that size and twist the manufacturer chooses.  The
frame is constructed with thirty-two spindles, that require the attention of
one girl to tend three frames, and one person will rope upon the machine as
much as three persons will want to run through the day.  Yarn enough to make
fifty yards of four quartered cloth can be spun in one frame in day, and this
is all done by the labor of one girl, from the flax. -- Much prosperity may be
anticipated from manufacturing of linen.

    The following letter from Gen. Barnum to the compiler, dated 3d of August
1829 will correct any erroneous reports which may exist as to the present state
of the hemp business in the vicinity of Vergennes.

    "DEAR SIR -- I have received yours of the 29th ult. and in reply have to
inform you that the Hemp Machine erected at this place last season (after the
Model of Hines' patent) was kept in operation until June, and finished breaking
most of the hemp raised in this region of country, excepting a few small lots,
which will be brought in this fall.  The performance of this machine has in
every respect equalled the expectation of the proprietors.

    "Several experiments have been made in this neighborhood to build machines
less expensive, which it was hoped might perform equally well; and I am sorry
to add, that the projectors and builders have   been disappointed in their
expectations.  The proprietors of two of these Machines reserved a quantity of
Hemp for the purpose of dressing in theirs.  They have both tried the
experiment, and have since applied to the agent of this machine to have their
hemp thus reserved, broken out as early as the machine commences operation for
the fall business, which will be in the early part of September.

    I look for no improvement in the principles of the machine -- Its
performance is satisfactory on rotted hemp or flax, and none other ought to be
taken to any machine.  A scotching machine, or dresser may be justly considered
a useful appendage.  It can be built with trifling expense, and is necessary to
disengage the shives from the coat and prepare it in first rate condition for
market.

    In consequence of the unfortunate error into which all our hemp growers
were led in this country last season, to wit:  the belief that the process of
water rotting hemp was unnecessary, many of our farmers have been deterred from
making a further attempt this season.  Others who attributed the partial
failure to the proper cause, have doubled their diligence, and will, I have no
doubt, be abundantly remunerated.  I consider it decidedly the most profitable
crop our country produces, on lands well adapted to its growth.

    It is true that yankee enterprize and perseverance has overdone almost
every thing in which they have been spiritedly engaged.  With this article
however, I believe for the next five or six years at least, the increased home
consumption, the foreign demand, and the falling off of importations will
afford abundant scope for the full exercise of all their energies.

    Your obedient and very humble servant.

                                        A. W. BARNUM.

    The following is a copy of a letter from Horace Wheeler Esq. agent and
proprietor of the Vergennes Machine to A. Emmons Esq. another of the
proprietors, dated April 22, 1829.

    DEAR SIR, Agreeable to your request I forward you the cost of our machine
-- the quantity of Hemp dressed per day, the expense of tending it &c.

        Cost of Machine - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   $1500
        Deduct for Tools, shop to build in &c.- - - -     300
                                                         -!!-
                                                         1200
        Cost of buildings - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    1000
                                                         -!!-
                                                        $2200*
    
     *Gen. Barnum in his estimate has taken into the account the right of
running the machine.

    Our machine works well, and has in some instances dressed one and a half
Tons of lint per day --say between sun and sun.  Much depends on the quality of
the stem -- middling sized stem, produces most hemp and is easiest broken.  I
have run the machine when it did not dress more than half a Ton a day; but I
consider a fair average per day -- say month in and month out, from 12 to 15
hundred weight.

    The number of hands employed in and about the machine is seven and
distributed thus:  Three men at the head of the machine; one boy to take hemp
off the apron; one man to prepare it for baling; one man to tend drying house,
and one boy to run on errands &c.  I have found this number of hands to be
necessary in order to work the machine to advantage, whether the hemp be rotted
or unrotted.  A greater quantity of hemp may be dressed after rotting than
before.  Our machine is perfect -- I have run a quantity of dew rotted Hemp,
and it takes the shives out perfectly clean, except some few which are easily
divested from the lint by shaking it.  It dresses Flax equally well and without
waste.

    Our business is improving -- All that is wanting, or has been, to make it
profitable is funds to carry it on.  Our hemp is nearly all prepared for
market, and will be shipped, in a few days; and poor as it is (owing to the
uncommon wet season -- having all stood for seed to ripen -- and all unrotted)
will command, as I am informed by Mr. Wells, the great Hemp dealer in New-York,
one hundred to one hundred and twenty dollars per ton.  He writes me that he
sold American water rotted hemp last week -- rather inferior quality -- at two
hundred dollars per ton.  He quotes it from two hundred to two hundred and
fifty.  We are making preparations for water rotting all our hemp the coming
season.

        Respectfully yours, *c.
                                            H. WHEELER."
