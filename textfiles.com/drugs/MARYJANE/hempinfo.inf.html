 Did you know??
 
 HEMP (marijuana) CAN SAVE THE WORLD!
 
 This in not a joke, but a very well documented subject that has been know since before 1938 when HEMP's cultivation was outlawed. 
 
 Here are some interesting facts:
 
 - 1 acre of Hemp (marijuana) = 4 acres of trees and will make every grade of paper BETTER at 1/4th of the cost of wood pulp and 1/5th the pollution. (source: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture)
 
 - Hemp seed is one of the world's best and cheapest sources of protein, and contains no THC. (source: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, U.S. Congressional Records)
 
 - Hemp and waste paper can generate ALL fuel for autos and replace ALL nuclear power at a fraction of the cost of fossil fuel WITH NO POLLUTION or CHERNOBYLS. (source: Solar Gas 1980, Science Digest 1983-84, U.S. Dept. Energy)
 
 - Hemp plants can reach treelike heights of 20 feet or more & could replace cut forests in just one growing season! (source: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture)
 
 - 10 acres of Hemp is equal to 40 acres of pulp land. Hemp forests would protect the top soil from further erosion.  Hemp plants make oxygen for you and ME to breath! (source: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture)
 
 Here are just a few of the things that could be manufactured from Hemp, just to name a few...
 
  - Clothing (softer and more durable than cotton)
  - Automobile GAS (pollution free)
  - Motor OIL
  - Coal (pollution free burning)
  - Cellophane
  - Methanol
  - Plastics
  - TNT (dynamite)
  - Medicines
  - Food (the seeds of Hemp contain no THC and are second to soybean in protein content)
  - Hemp oil could replace WHALE oil
 

 If you would like to learn more about this topic there is a Television network called: "THE 90's" that speaks out on this topic. THE 90's is shown on "Public TV" stations in most major cities in the U.S.A. THE 90's has had such an incredible response to an episode that was done on Hemp, that they are going to sell a one hour video tape on the topic: Hemp Can Save The Environment.

 There is nothing new about the many uses of Hemp. Hemp has been used for hundreds of years until 1938 when its cultivation became illegal. If fact our very own United States Constitution was written on paper made from Hemp. In fact in those days all of our paper was made from Hemp, and both George Washington & Thomas Jefferson were Hemp farmers. During World War II our own US government made a film called; 'Hemp for Victory', a film to encourage farmers to grow Hemp so that its fibers could be made into rope, army uniforms, and parachutes. Today in China (were Hemp is legal) it is used to make both clothing and paper. Go to your library and check out any books published by our US Dept. of agriculture this has been a known fact since 1937 when the Dept. of Agriculture predicted it to be the number #1 cash crop in the USA because of its uses as food, fiber, paper and petroleum products. This is why petrochemical and pharmaceutical companies spent so much time and money to propagandize the plants use as "Marijuana" (for smoking) by making movies like "Reefer Madness" so that they could continue to keep the monopoly on the products with which Hemp would compete.
 
 Wealthy families such as the Hursts, Duponts, and Mellons also spent a great deal of time and money to make sure that Hemp became illegal. William Hurst had the rights to cut down trees in the northwest to turn them into newspaper. Hurst owned all the major newspaper companies in the country at that time and he knew that people would not want the trees cut down if his newspaper could be made from Hemp fibers, so William Hurst used his newspaper companies to further spread the "Reefer Madness". Since Hemp IS petroleum and could totally replace our current fossil fuel system (pollution free, Hemp fuel contains no sulphur, and when burned does not create sulphur dioxide, no pollution, no acid rain), you can imagine why the Duponts and Mellons would have such an interest in seeing Hemp wiped out. It was during 1937-38 during the 'New Deal Legislation' where our government allowed big business to underwrite the laws that would govern them. Big business took advantage and spread the "reefer madness" so that they could continue to hold the monopolies on the goods with which Hemp would compete. It is no coincidence that in 1938 Hemp was outlawed and shortly after that Nylon was patented.

 HEMP FOR  ECOLOGY   Compiled  by  the  Business  Alliance  for
Commerce in  Hemp (BACH)  Provided by Access Unlimited, PO Box
1900, Frazier Park, CA 93225

     Hemp For  Ecology - Hemp is a soil building plant that is
excellent in  crop rotation  and, unlike cotton and corn, does
not require  heavy fertilization or pesticide use. In fact, an
organic pesticide spray is derived from the plant.

     With its  many commercial  uses, such  as manufacture  of
paper and  building supplies,  Hemp could reduce deforestation
by 50%  or more  worldwide. It  could  replace  a  significant
amount of plastics with cultivated cellulose, organic pulp and
fiber.  It could replace about half of t t petroleum we use as
gasoline with clean-burning  methanol fuel, and cut dependence
on coal  and nuclear  powered electricity  production  through
biomass pyrolysis.

     Its strong roots control erosion, and it has an important
role in  reforestation and  weed eradication  programs.   Help
restore ecological balance to America.

     Hemp Saves  Forests -  Over a 20 year period, one acre of
hemp will  produce as  much paper  as 4.1 acres of forest. But
America's  "cash   crop  of   tomorrow"  is  held  hostage  by
protectionist laws  that have led to the destruction of 70% of
our forests since 1937.

     Additionally, paper  made  from  hemp  lasts  many  times
longer than  that made  from wood  and uses only 10-20% of the
dangerous chemicals needed to make paper from wood.

     And Hemp  can be made into fiber board or particle board,
replacing wood  for construction or commercial fabrication.

     Hemp Saves  Oil - Methane, methanol, alcohol and fuel oil
made  from   Hemp  could  replace  petroleum  based  fuel  and
plastics, thus  saving America's  oil reserves,  reducing  the
trade deficit  and  protecting  the  environment.  Hemp  could
replace almost  all  oil, without any offshore drilling or oil
spills. A  Hemp spill  would not harm the ecology, requires no
cleanup and  would actually  enrich the  soil. Fuel or cooking
oil can  also be  made from  Hemp seed,  which is  30% oil  by
volume.  So long, OPEC and oil shortages!

     Hemp Instead  of Plastic - The pulp and fiber of the Hemp
plant offer  a completely biodegradable alternative to plastic
for many  uses or can be made i nto regular or "biodegradable"
plastic.

     Hemp paper bags are stronger and have more endurance than
wood pulp  paper, and  can be  reinforced with  Hemp fiber for
folding and  tensile strength  comparable to plastic bags, yet
are completely  biodegradable. Hemp can also be polymerized to
make anything  that is made of plastic, without using any oil.
But this alternative is kept off the market. Help restore free
enterprise to America.

     Hemp For  CLEANER AIR  -  When  biomass  fuel  burns,  it
produces CO2 (the cause of the Greenhouse Effect), the same as
fossil fuel;  but  during  the  growth  cycle  of  the  plant,
photosynthesis removes  as much CO2 from the air as burning it
adds,  so  Hemp  actually  cleans  the  atmosphere.    Equally
important, it does not contain sulfur, the major cause of acid
rain.

     Hemp For Soil - The strong roots of the hemp plant are an
important factor  in building  healthy soil.  They anchor  and
invigorate the soil to control erosion and mud slides. Hemp is
a hearty  plant that squeezes out weeds and pests, without the
heavy fertilization that corn, cotton, tobacco and other crops
need. Hemp is resistant to many insects, reducing the need for
chemical pesticides.

     Although illegal,  cannabis is  already the  largest cash
crop   in    several   states,    including   California   ($3
billion/year), and Hemp could save the family farm in America.
But special interest groups  have kept it out of  the reach of
our patriotic and hard working farmers.

     Hemp For Fuel - Hemp hurds are 77% cellulose and its per-
acre output of biomass fuel  is about 10 times more than corn,
the next  best source  of the fuel. We could replace virtually
all nuclear  energy and fossil fuel by using hemp biomass that
has been processed with a pyrolitic converter to make charcoal
to replace  coal, methanol  and even  gasoline to replace oil-
based gasoline,  methane gas to replace natural gas and any of
these can be burned to generate electricity.

     President Bush  called methanol  the "Home Grown Energy,"
but current  regulations prohibit  the use of Hemp in the U.S.
Help make  America energy-independent.  You can  do  something
about it.  For info:  $1 +  SASE  to:  Business  Alliance  for

Hemp's Role in Economic History - Hemp is regarded as probably
being the  first crop  cultivated by humans: as early as 8,000
B.C.  in   the  Middle  East.  Hemp  textile  industries  were
introduced at  about the  same time  in human  development  as
pottery.

     Hemp provided  the  sails  and  rigging  for  ships  that
allowed worldwide  commerce and made Columbus' trip to America
possible (other  fibers would  have decayed  somewhere in mid-
Atlantic).

     Hemp  replaced  papyrus  as  the  source  of  paper  that
eventually fostered  the spread of written knowledge. Hemp was
the largest  cash crop  in  the  world  until  the  late  19th
century, when new technology began to replace it.

     Hemp's Role  Today -  With some  50,000 commercial  uses,
Hemp is  the most  versatile renewable natural resource on the
planet. And it is again the largest cash crop in America; Hemp
generates almost four times as much revenue ($41.6 billion/yr)
as  does   its  closest  competitor,  corn  ($13.37  billion),
according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.

     But this  is only  a  small  fraction  of  the  potential
revenue that  will be  generated when  Hemp  again  takes  its
rightful place  in  the  agricultural,  textile,  food,  fuel,
cordage,  fabrication,  pharmaceutical  medicines,  paper  and
other affected  businesses in  a decentralized  ecological and
financially stable economy.

     Hemp For  farms -  Hemp was  the major  cash crop  of the
U.S., including  most of  the areas  now suffering from family
farm foreclosures,  until just before the Great Depression. It
is still  a viable  cash crop  and could  be grown on marginal
lands, between  crop seasons  or on  fallow land to enrich the
soil. Hemp is the best energy biomass crop identified to date,
and could  provide the  raw  materials  for  renewed  economic
growth in rural and "rust belt" communities.

     Hemp For  Clothing -  Fabrics made  from  hemp  are  more
insulating, softer,  stronger, more  water absorbent  and last
many times  longer than cotton. This amazing plant fiber holds
its  shape  as  well  as  polyester,  but  "breathes"  and  is
biodegradable because  it is  completely organic.  It has been
valued for  its durability  since before  recorded history. It
can be  woven as coarse as burlap, smooth as silk or intricate
as lace.  The canvass  sails on  generations of  ships and the
original Levi jeans were all made of hemp. The quality of this
natural fiber has yet to be surpassed.

     Hemp For  Paper -  Paper made  from hemp lasts many times
longer  than  that  made  of  wood  pulp,  without  yellowing,
cracking or otherwise deteriorating.

     Hemp pulp does not require as much of the chemical needed
to break down lignin as wood, does not cause dioxin pollution,
and has  been called  the  "archivist's  perfect  paper."  The
Declaration of  Independence and  the U.S.  Constitution  were
both originally  drafted on  Hemp. Restrictions  on Hemp  have
added to  the destruction  of about  70% of  American  forests
since 1937.  Help  restore  Hemp  to  its  rightful  place  in
history.

     Hemp could  Save S&Ls - The Savings & Loan industry could
recoup its  losses by  allowing debtors (i.e., real estate) to
invest in  hemp..For example,  the cost  of  the  federal  S&L
bailout program  submitted by  President Bush  in August, 1989
was  $50  billion.  "Marijuana"  income  for  1988  was  $41.6
billion: the  money generated  by sales  of relaxational  Hemp
alone could  pay off  80% or more of the difference. Estimates
of the  total legitimate  revenues that  would be generated by
legal commerce  in non-smoking Hemp range from 10 to 100 times
that amount.

     Hemp Saves Taxes -  Marijuana prohibition and eradication
programs waste  hundreds of millions of tax dollars, create an
untaxed black  market of  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  and
increased the  domestic marijuana  crop, according to the DEA.
The National  Institute on  Drug Abuse  (NIDA) estimated  that
there were 21 million regular smokers of marijuana and hashish
in 1988.  A lucrative  market in  smoking paraphernalia  worth
billions of dollars is being suppressed.

HEMP FOR  FUEL  Compiled by the Business Alliance for Commerce
in Hemp  (BACH).   Provided by  Access Unlimited, PO Box 1900,
Frazier Park, CA 93225

     Biomass  conversion   to  fuel  has  proven  economically
feasible,  first   in  laboratory   tests  and  by  continuous
operation of  pilot plants in field tests since 1973. When the
energy crop  is growing  it takes in CO2 from the air, so when
it is burned the CO2 is released, creating a balanced system.

     Biomass is  the term  used to  describe all  biologically
produced matter.  World production  of biomass is estimated at
146 billion metric tons a year, mostly wild plant growth. Some
farm crops and trees can produce up to 20 metric tons per acre
of biomass  a year.  Types of algae and grasses may produce 50
metric tons per year.

     This biomass  has a  heating value  of 5000-8000  BTU/lb,
with virtually  no ash  or sulfur  produced during combustion.
About 6%  of contiguous  United  States  land  area  put  into
cultivation for  biomass could  supply all current demands for
oil and gas.

     The foundation  upon which  this will  be achieved is the
emerging concept of "energy farming," wherein farmers grow and
harvest crops for biomass conversion to fuels.

     Pyrolysis is  the technique  of  applying  high  heat  to
organic matter  (lignocellulosic materials)  in the absence of
air or  in reduced  air. The  process  can  produce  charcoal,
condensable  organic   liquids  (pyrolitic   fuel  oil),  non-
condensable gasses,  acetic acid,  acetone, and  methanol. The
process can be adjusted to favor charcoal, pyrolytic oil, gas,
or methanol production with a 95.5% fuel-to-feed efficiency.

     Pyrolysis has  been used  since the dawn of civilization.
Ancient Egyptians  practiced wood  distillation by  collecting
the tars  and pyroligneous  acid for  use in  their  embalming
industry.

     Methanol-powered automobiles  and reduced  emissions from
coal-fired  power   plants  can  be  accomplished  by  biomass
conversion to  fuel utilizing pyrolysis technology and at the
same time  save the  American family  farm while  turning  the
American heartland  into a  prosperous source  of clean energy
production.

     Pyrolysis has  the advantage of using the same technology
now used  to process  crude fossil fuel oil and coal. Coal and
oil conversion  is more  efficient in  terms  of  fuel-to-feed
ratio,  but   biomass  conversion   by  pyrolysis   has   many
environmental and economic advantages over coal and oil.

     Pyrolysis facilities  will run  three shifts  a day. Some
68% of  the energy of the raw biomass will be contained in the
charcoal and fuel oils made at the facility. This charcoal has
nearly the  same heating  value in BTU as coal, with virtually
no sulfur.

     Pyrolytic fuel  oil has  similar properties  to no. 2 and
no. 6  fuel oil.  The charcoal can be transported economically
by rail to all urban area power plants generating electricity.
The fuel  oil can  be  transported  economically  by  trucking
creating more  jobs  for  Americans.  When  these  plants  use
charcoal instead of coal, the problems of acid rain will begin
to disappear.

     When this  energy system  is on  line producing  a steady
supply of  fuel for  electrical power  plants, it will be more
feasible to  build the  complex gasifying  systems to  produce
methanol from  the cubed  biomass, or  make synthetic gasoline
from the  methanol by  the addition  of the  Mobil Co. process
equipment to the gasifier.


     Farmers must be allowed to grow an energy crop capable of
producing 10  tons per  acre in 90-120 days. This crop must be
woody in nature and high in lignocellulose. It must be able to
grow in all climactic zones in America.

     And it  should not  compete with  food crops for the most
productive land,  but be  grown in rotation with food crops or
on marginal land where food crop production isn't profitable.

     When farmers  can make  a profit  growing energy, it will
not take long to get 6% of continental American land mass into
cultivation of  biomass fuel  -enough to replace our economy's
dependence on  fossil fuels.  We will  no longer be increasing
the CO2  burden  in  the  atmosphere.  The  threat  of  global
greenhouse warming and adverse climactic change will diminish.

     To keep costs down, pyrolysis reactors need to be located
within a  50 mile  radius of  the energy farms. This necessity
will bring  life back  to our  small towns  by providing  jobs
locally.

     Hemp is  the number one biomass producer on planet earth:
10 tons  per acre  in approximately four months. It is a woody
plant containing 77% cellulose. Wood produces 60% cellulose.

     This energy  crop can be harvested with equipment readily
available.  It   can  be   "cubed"  by  modifying  hay  cubing
equipment. This  method condenses  the bulk, reducing trucking
costs from the field to the pyrolysis reactor. And the biomass
cubes are ready for conversion with no further treatment.

     Hemp is drought resistant, making it an ideal crop in the
dry western  regions of  the country. Hemp is the only biomass
resource capable of making America energy independent. And our
government outlawed it in 1938.

     Remember, in  10 years,  by the  year 2000,  America will
have exhausted  80% of her petroleum reserves. Will we then go
to war  with the  Arabs for the privilege of driving our cars;
will we  stripmine our land for coal, and poison our air so we
can drive  our autos  an extra  100 years;  will we  raze  our
forests for our energy needs?

     During World  War II,  our supply  of hemp was cut off by
the  Japanese.   The  federal   government  responded  to  the
emergency  by   suspending  marijuana  prohibition.  Patriotic
American farmers  were encouraged  to apply  for a  license to
cultivate hemp and  responded  enthusiastically.  Hundreds  of
thousands of acres of hemp were grown.

     The argument  against hemp production does not hold up to
scrutiny:  hemp  grown  for  biomass  makes  very  poor  grade
marijuana. The  20 to 40 million Americans who smoke marijuana
would loath  to smoke  hemp grown  for biomass,  so a farmer's
hemp biomass crop is worthless as marijuana.

     It is  time the  government once  again  respond  to  our
economic emergency  as they  did in WWII to permit our farmers
to grow  American hemp  so this  mighty nation  can once again
become energy independent and smog free.

Hemp has  a long, Proud history of medical use and hundreds of
therapeutic applications.

     For more  than 3,500  years, Hemp  has been (depending on
the culture or nation) either the most used or one of the most
widely used plants for medicines. This includes: China, India,
the Middle  and Near  East, Africa  and Europe.  From 1850  to
1937, Hemp  was America's  prime medicine  for more  than  100
separate illnesses or diseases.

     Research by  Dr. Raphael  Mechoulam, etc.  indicates that
when Cannabis  Hemp is  legally available,  it  will  directly
replace some  10-20% of  all prescription pharmaceutical drugs
and  that   probably  40-50%   of  all   medicines  could  use
derivatives of the cannabis plant.

     Hemp For  Health -  Medical uses of Hemp include treating
back pain,  asthma, glaucoma, epilepsy, cancer, muscle spasms,
migraines, tumors,  stress, depression  and anorexia. It is an
antibiotic and  expectorant, useful in muscle ointments and to
treat arthritis  and rheumatism. Hundreds of other therapeutic
uses are  likely, but  health   permits are required to use
it, and  the federal  government banned  research into medical
use  of  Hemp,  so  millions  of  people  continue  to  suffer
needlessly, and  a valuable herbal medicine with minimal side-
effects is held hostage by out-of-date laws.

     Cannabis users statistically live one or two years longer
than  non-users.   Hemp  offers  affordable  health  care  for
America.

     Hemp Helps  Children -  Medicines based  on hemp would be
most beneficial  to young  children, bringing  a  lifetime  of
relief and  ad ing years to their lives. Asthma symptoms could
be permanently  reduced. Hemp  eases the  symptoms of epilepsy
and prevents  glaucoma  from  developing,  bringing  effective
relief to  those  unfortunate  enough  to  suffer  from  these
illnesses.

     Hemp for  Cancer -  Hemp reduces  the nausea  suffered by
chemotherapy  patients.  This  same  characteristic  has  also
recently been  utilized by  AIDS  patients  and  is  sometimes
indicated for motion sickness (sea sickness).

     Hemp Saves  Eyes - Medical Hemp would benefit some 90% of
victims of  glaucoma, a  blinding disease.  Cannabis does  not
cure it  or reverse  the loss  of vision,  but  can  halt  the
glaucoma sufferer's progressive deterioration of eyesight.

     Hemp for arthritis & Rheumatism - A traditional treatment
for these ailments is to soak cannabis in alcohol and apply it
locally in a poultice.

     Hemp Relieves  Stress - Cannabis reduces mental agitation
and ulcers.  One out  of two American marriages end in divorce
and domestic  violence is  on the  increase. Studies  indicate
that these problems often result from the stress and depressed
sex drive  associated with  the fast pace of modern life. Hemp
is well  known for  its ability  to reduce  stress and promote
relaxation, and  has long been regarded as an aphrodisiac, yet
it is not available on the open market.

     Cannabis was  withdrawn from  the American Public in 1938
against the  advice of  the medical  community. Hemp was moved
from the  Class  2  schedule  of  drugs  (having  demonstrated
medical value) and listed as Class 1 (dangerous substance with
no  known  medical  value)  by  the  Nixon  administration  in
1970-despite all  evidence to the contrary-and was retained as
Class 1 by the Bush administration in 1989.

     In 1972  the Nixon-appointed Shafer Commission urged that
cannabis be  re-legalized, which  was not done. Still, medical
research
continued -often  with remarkable  results. Cannabis was shown
to help  treat numerous  health problems  with very  few  side
effects.

     Eleven  states   went  on   to  adopt   laws  authorizing
prescription use of medical marijuana.

     More Research  Is Needed - At the 1975 National Institute
of Drug  Abuse (NIDA)  Asilomar Conference,  participants were
amazed at  the documented  results of  marijuana research  and
agreed that  a massive national research project was in order.
Instead, all  federal research  grants were terminated in 1976
and subsequent private research has been heavily restricted.

     By late 1983 the Reagan/Bush administration had destroyed
large  amounts   of  data  compiled  in  government  sponsored
marijuana research  and put  out a feeler to private and state
universities and  others to  destroy their  own records.  Most
refused to do so.

     In September,  1988,  DEA  Administrative  Judge  Francis
Young concluded  that cannabis should be re-scheduled as Class
2 and  made available  for medical use. It has not been. Write
to your  representatives and ask that Hemp be re-legalized for
use in America.

     There are  thousands of  other uses  for Hemp:  textiles,
paper, fiber, food, fuel, medicine and more.

     For more  information, we  recommend that  you  read  The
Emperor Wears  No Clothes,  by  Jack  Herer  and  The  Medical
Marijuana Papers by Dr. Tod Mikurya.
