    Letter from GEN. BARNUM to the Editor of the Vermont Aurora:

    SIR.-- Having recently received a great number of communications on the
subject of the culture of Hemp, I am induced to ask through the medium of your
paper the privilege of a reply to the whole of them, which will save all
parties some trouble, at least.  I do not wish it to be supposed, however, that
I consider the communications burthensome: quite otherwise.  I am pleased with
their enquiries, happy to add their names to the list of my correspondents, and
only regret my want of knowledge and experience to give them all the
information required.  Before I attempt to reply to their different enquiries,
it is proper to say that when I embarked in the business, I commenced wrong and
continued in error until it was too late to prevent the damage sustained in the
last year's crop, for want of proper information.  Bad as it was, it proved
better than any other crop upon my farm.

    With respect to Soil. -- Intervale land or that covered with vegetable
mould, called black muck, is generally considered best:  in a warm and
moderately wet season, it is so; but by no means ought to be considered the
only land suitable for its growth.  In fact, any land in our climate that will
bear a good crop of flax, corn or potatoes, will produce a good crop of hemp.

    Preparation for Sowing.-- Where green sward is intended, I consider it
preferable on most soils, particularly clay, to have it ploughed in the fall. 
Previous to sowing, the soil should be harrowed thoroughly in the Spring, when
the surface is dry; and if not quite smooth, it will be much improved by
passing a roller over it -- (a machine which ought to be more generally used
for many farming purposes.)  Other lands may be ploughed in the Spring, and the
oftener the better:  in no instance should the operation of sowing be performed
until the land is thoroughly pulverized by the plough and harrow.  Flat and low
lands ought to be laid in ridges of from five to seven feet in width for this,
as well as all other crops.  On loam or sandy soils, it will be found
advantageous occasionally to run furrows from the upper to the lower side of
your fields, to permit the water in case of heavy rains or wet seasons to pass
off freely.  Hemp, in our climate, is a healthy, hardy plant, and yields to no
enemy except water and frost.  It effectually subdues the grub and wire worm,
the thistle and every noxious weed, and leaves the land light and in fine
condition for any succeeding crop.

    Time for Sowing and Planting.-- In this particular, it is a most
accommodating crop.  In our climate, any time from the 1st of May to the 24th
of June may be considered good season:  all things being right, I should prefer
sowing between the 5th of May and the 10th of June.-- Last season, some crops
were sown as late as the 10th of July, after a crop of flax had been taken from
the land, and these crops were good.  It must be recollected, however, that the
last season was unusually favorable for late sowed crops.  The success of these
experiments ought not to induce us to imitate this hazardous example.  It is
true, we are promised a seed time and a harvest, but it is equally true that
the promise does not include all seasons of the year; and such as calculate to
benefit themselves by this good promise, ought to remember there is an implied
condition which admonishes us that we have something to do ourselves to insure
its benefits.

    Quantity of Seed.--  Two bushels I consider the proper quantity to be sowed
upon an acre of good land (and none other ought ever to be sowed with hemp.) 
The prevalent idea of a hemp crop's impoverishing land more than any other of
equal growth, requiring nourishment from the earth and atmosphere, is
altogether ridiculous.  Where green sward is intended, three crops are sowed in
succession:  the second, usually best, and the third about equal to the first. 
A regular rotation of crops in good husbandry is desirable, where circumstances
will permit; but not absolutely requisite, as is often contended.

    Time and Manner of Harvesting.-- As long as hemp seed maintains its present
price, I consider the most profitable time to cut or pull it is when about half
of the seed has attained its full size.  By so doing, you save a considerable
portion of the male hemp, which bears no seed, and the lint of the female hemp,
nearly in perfection; and in addition, secure to yourself from 8 to 10 bushels
of seed to the acre, and the lint but little inferior to that cut in the blow. 
if sowed or planted entirely for seed, it should stand longer, but not so late
as is usually practised.  If it remains until a great portion of the seed is
turned to a black or dark brown colour, you lose more by shelling, in the
operation of gathering, than is lost by light and imperfect seed by securing it
earlier.  The stalks of hemp planted for seed are of little value--not worth
the expense of transportation to a machine.  The usual mode of harvesting in
this country, is performed by cutting it with a cradle.  Where the surface of
the land is quite smooth, it is undoubtedly the most expeditious manner of
gathering; but not in my opinion the most economical.  I consider pulling
decidedly preferable.  The best part of the coater lint is that nearest the
root.  Four inches of the bottom of the stalk (which is generally left when
cradled) is worth more than twelve inches near the top; and in a good crop the
saving would be equal to the whole expense of pulling.  Before dismissing this
subject, I consider it my duty to say that in my preference for pulling,
instead of cradling, I differ inn opinion with the Kentucky hemp growers and
most of my neighbors in whose judgment I have great confidence on most
subjects; but in this particular, I believe they are mistaken.  Experience, our
surest guide, will shortly test the correctness of these opinions.

    After pulling or cradling, it should be bound in bundles of 6 or 8 inches
in diameter, put into stooks of 10 or 12 bundles, with the butts standing out
and the tops secured by at least two bands.  In this manner it may remain where
a partial seed crop is expected, until fit for thrashing; the time for which
must in a great degree depend upon the state of the weather; the sooner it can
be done the better.  Immediately after thrashing it should be taken to a pond
or vat, for water rotting or housed.  As exposure to the atmosphere not only
injures the colour, but the fibre, great care should be taken before binding to
even the butts.  This is an important consideration, not only in dressing, but
in the value of the article in market.

    The profits of a Hemp Crop.-- I must reply to this enquiry, by saying, that
the extravagant anticipations of many (who are at least half crazy on this
subject) cannot be realized.  I believe, when properly managed on suitable
land, it is decidedly the most profitable crop our country produces; but such
as expect a profit of from 75 to 100 dollars per acre, will nine times out of
ten experience disappointment.  Such profits have in some instances been
realized; but they are of rare occurrence.  John Fraser, Esq. of Ferrisburgh,
one of our most wealthy and respectable farmers, will realize a net profit of
more than ninety dollars an acre from the land he sowed last season to hemp;
but few if any of his neighbors can boast a similar result.

    I consider the average net proceeds of a fair crop on suitable land, will
be from 25 to 30 dollars per acre.  Notwithstanding our want of information
from the beginning of our experiments, and bad management to the close of last
season.  I am warranted in saying, that all the hemp growers of a fair crop in
this neighborhood, where common prudence has been exercised, will realize a
profit of at least 20 dollars per acre.

    Preparation for Market.-- Since the introduction of Hines' Patent Hemp and
Flax Dressing Machine, (which from all the information I have been able to
obtain, is preferable to any machine now in operation in Europe or America)
most of the hemp offered in market from the Northern States, has been dressed
without either dew or water rotting in the stem, -- a practice which ought not
to be continued or countenanced.  From this circumstance, American hemp has
been quoted at a price much below the foreign article; which has induced many
to believe that our soil and climate are not adapted to its growth, and that we
must always be tributary to Russia for the first quality of this indispensable
article. -- Such impressions are erroneous, and ought to be corrected.  The
soil and climate of many parts of the Northern States and a considerable
portion of Lower Canada will produce as good hemp as grows on earth.  All that
is required to bring the article into just repute, is proper care in
cultivation and suitable preparation for market.  I repeat, that water rotting
in the stem is indispensably requisite; and without this process, we cannot
rationally calculate on a successful competition with a nation less civilized
than our own.  American farmers are generally in too great haste.  We try to do
too much.  It would be for our interest to improve less land and to cultivate
better what we do improve.  Dew rotting improves hemp very much, but is by no
means equal to water rotting.  The latter process is less expensive.  Most
farmers who have no natural ponds, can with trifling expense fit up a little
pool or vat.  On clay land, where water can be introduced, two men with a team
plough and scraper, will with two or three days labor, make an artificial pond
sufficient for water rotting the produce of 20 acres.  The time for hemp to be
immersed, depends on the temperature of the water.  From 3 to 6 days, will, at
the proper season be found sufficient in still and stagnant water, which is
generally considered preferable.  it should be carefully watched after the
third day, and when the coat is found easily to separate from the stem, the
work is done, and no time should be lost in removing it from the water.  The
best and least expensive mode of drying is to unbind the hemp and set it up by
the side of a fence or light railing, erected for the purpose, where the water
will readily drain off, and the hemp dry much sooner than by spreading it upon
grass.  For want of necessary conveniences for drying in this manner and the
process for spreading, grassland should be resorted to.  Great care ought to be
taken in wet or moist weather, to have it turned often, to prevent mill-dew. 
After drying, it may be bound in large bundles, taking care to even the butts
as much as possible, and immediately housed or taken to the Machine for drying.
