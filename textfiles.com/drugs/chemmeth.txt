                             Methamphetamine
                           By Elric of Imrryr


        Forward & Upward. . .
Part of the data in this file was provided by Alric of Hawkwood from
an article in the Spokane Spokesman-Review, which listed a table
(kindly provided by the local Drug Enforcement Agency office), on the
chemicals used in the manufacture of Methamphetamine.
        This information in this file is provided only for research
purposes, as the manufacturing, possessing, or even planning to
manufacture Methamphetamine is a FELONY, not to mention a dangerous
process that should not be attempted in ones' kitchen, or without some
practical knowledge of chemicals and lab safety. Many of these
chemicals are very flammable, explosive, and/or very toxic.
        Most of these chemicals are on the DEA's 'Watch List', persons
ordering (or even asking about) certain of these chemicals maybe
reported to local or federal law enforcement agencies. Possession of
some of the precursors without a valid reason maybe enough evidence
to charge a person with intent to manufacture and distribute.

Ephedrine
Methylamine - Very hazardous, extremely flammable

Phosphorus pentachloride - Very hazardous, may react violently with water
Platinum
Platinum oxide
Sodium (metal) - Very hazardous, somewhat flammable, reacts violently on
contact with moisture
Sodium Acetate anhydrous
Sodium Cyanotrihydridoborate - Very hazardous, flammable, may react violently
with water

Sulfuric Acid - Very hazardous, may react violently with water
Thionyl chloride - Very hazardous, may react violent with water



        If you are interested in information on the actual process
of synthesizing Methamphetamine, I would recommend the following two
books:

        Secrets of Methamphetamine Manufacture
        By 'Uncle Fester'. Pub 1987 $14.95
        Available through Loompanics Unlimited
        Catalog #85067

        Psychedelic Chemistry
        By Michael Valetine Smith. Pub 1981 $14.95
        Available through Loompanics Unlimited
        Catalog #85024
        It also may be available (most likely by special order)
        through your local book seller (unless it is run by Fascists).

        Loompanics address is:
        POB 1197
        Port Townsend, WA 98368

        NOTE: If you have to order through the mail, or place a
        special order with your local book shop, I might recommend
        that you send it to someone else house, or get a mail drop, as
        you never know. . . (Also pay in cash or money order, not check
        or credit card), better paranoid then sorry.
