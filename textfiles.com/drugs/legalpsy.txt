              A LIST OF LEGAL PSYCHADELIC DRUGS 
                 BY THE STAINLESS STEEL RAT
 
 
Here are some legal highs. these may or may not make you very sick,
or give you a fine experience. Have a great time,but I'm NOT liable
for anything that happens(or dosen't happen. heh) to you. 
 
 
MORNING GLORY SEEDS:

 The seeds of this common flowering vine contain a substance chemically very similar to LSD. Take ab 100-150 seeds for a starter, picking the Pearly Gates or Heavenly Blue variety.
BE SURE TO ORDER WHOLESALE FROM A LARGE SEED COMPANY. Most store-
brand seeds have been sprayed with a noxious chemical to discourage
this practice.
Mash the seeds,and soak the pulp in warm water for 8-12 hours.
Strain the liquid through a cloth,and hold your nose,and drink it
down,discarding the seed pulp. This is almost gaurenteed to make you
feel VERY sick at first,but is then like a mild dose of acid,so be
careful of when you do this. Trippin at work is not a good plan.
 
 
LETTUCE:

 Wild lettuce is full of a chemical similar to opium,and was once
used as an opium substitiute. This same chemical can be found in
the heart and roots of store-bought lettuce. Romain or Butter lettuce
are better than Iceburg. Particularly Romain. 
Take the whole wild lettuce,or the heart and roots of your store's,
and run it through a veggie juicer. keep feeding it in until you have
about 1 pint(2 cups) of liquid. Pour it into a glass bowl,and let it
evaporate under a heat lamp,or the sun. Scrape up the residue,and 
smoke a pinch at a time of it in a pipe.If you smoke a lot of it,
this can get you VERY wasted,so be careful.
 
CATNIP:
 
 Never actually tried this one,but supposedly,this can get you stoned
in much the same way as grass. Roll it like a joint. Some say it's
stronger when mixed with tobacco. You must smoke a lot of it to get
a mild buzz,so maybe it's better to stick to dope,unless you're on
probation,in rehab,or whatever else may hold you back.
 
BANANNA SKINS:
 
 This was a Hippy Hoax in the 1960's that had some stores publicly
banning banannas. Technically,there is somthing in the skins which
can get you high,and if you really BELIEVE it,then there you go. 
Take and peel a dozen banannas,scarf down the good parts,and scrape
the white pulp from the inside of the skins. Add water,and boil it
down to a gummy mush. dry in in a low oven until it is powder,and
then smoke it in a pipe.
 
HOPS:
 
 Brew one ounce of hops in 2 cups of water. allow it to steep for a 
few hours,and strain. Drink it a few tablespoons at a time,and it
will mellow you right out. Can send you to sleep if you drink it
too fast. I haven't tried this one either,as I don't know where to
find hops.
 
NUTMEG:
 
 This is to be used ONLY as a last resort. Prison convicts do this
to get stoned sometimes,and the one time I tried it,I was SICK!
Take 2 teaspoonfuls of freshly ground nutmeg,and if you're lucky,
you'll be in for an interesting experience. If you're unlucky,like
I was,you'll have rapid heartbeat,headache and dizziness. 
 
MACE:
 
 The same as nutmeg. ONLY if you're TRUELY desperate,take 2 teaspoon
fuls,and kick back. But have a sick-bin handy just in case....
 
VITAMIN B12:
 
 Take about a dozen capsules,and be prepared to jitter and jive the
whole day long. Also be prepared to piss orange for a week.
 
 
GRAVOL:
 
 I'm very leery about this one,as a friend of mine took 20 50mg tabs
of gravol,got REALLY stoned,but then ended up in the hospital with
a bad trip to end them all. I've taken 5,and got very mellow. taking
a dozen or more is supposed to be like acid. You can buy this in any
pharmacy,over the counter. Just ask the druggist for it. If you're
pretty young,just say it's for mommy's trip to Toronto,as she gets
air-sick easily. 
 
MAGIC MUSHROOMS:
 
 WARNING: UNLESS YOU ARE AN EXPERT,DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EAT ANY MUSHROOM
THAT YOU MAY FIND. TAKING THE WRONG MUSHROOM CAN CAUSE SEVERE ORGAN
AND/OR BRAIN DAMAGE,AND EVEN DEATH!
If you must take your own life into your drug-crazed hands,then first
go to your local library,and look up books on psychadelic fungi,or
just fungi in general. they will have pictures,and ways to test the
shrooms to see if they have psilocybin in them. There are a great many
varieties of shrooms here on the West Coast,but there are a few
poisonous ones too. The best places to look,once you are armed with
knowlege,is Abbotsford(If you're a local) or any neighbouring farmer's
feild,or even your own lawn sometimes. JUST BE CAREFUL!
