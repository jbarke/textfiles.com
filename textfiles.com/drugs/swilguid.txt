                        The Power of Positive Drinking

                             from start to finish

             (When you tip the first beer until you hit the floor)

                      Written by -=> * Atomic Punk * <=-
                     inspiration provided by many parties



The Opening: The Cranial Can Opener

1.  Hero contemplates beer. Develops zenlike concentration.
2.  Tensing forehead, hero rams beer into frontal lobe at 40 mph. Pop-top 
     pops!

Basic Artillery - Gunning, Shooting, or Torpedoing

1.  Artillery master prepares beer by puncturing bottom with a screwdriver or
    similar device.
2.  Placing mouth on hole, he sucks air out, creating a vacuum chamber. 
    Tilting head back, he firmly grasps pop-top and opens throat.
3.  Using a brisk motion hepops top, and beer jets down his throat at
    approximately 28 mph.
4.  Exactly 1.7 seconds later, our plucky swiller displays the empty can as
    proof to nonbelievers.

Putting Technology to Work: Our Friend the Beer Bong

1.  Master bongsman bravely sticks a funnel in his mouth, blocking the end of
    with his tongue, then fills the "reservoir" (funnel) with beer.
2.  Bongee becomes bonger by bonging himself by raising the "mountain lake"
    skyward, then releasing te "tongue cork," allowing the malt waterfall to
    shoot bellyward.

A Chug in Time Saves Nine

1.  The Megachug: Overcoming the limitations of he one-beer/ one-chug is made
    easy for our megachugger by the ready availability of large flower vases, 
    small garbage cans, and other Herculean containers.
2.  Look Ma, no hands! Our frisky "chugging machine" skips the forelay. Just
    tilting his head back, opening his mouth (wide), and inserting the beer, he
    lets gravity do the rest.

The Finale: Destroying the Evidence

1.  Our hero has a lot on his mind - how to hide the case of beer he ust drank
    from the police that just walked in.
2.  Putting his brain to work, he indents the sides of the can to facilitate
    squashing and then, using the basic "ramming home a point" technique,
    flattens can and head.

The Encore: The Final Bite

1.  Our swiller returns for the climax of climaxes. He holds the beer in his
    hand and prays for his teeth.
2.  Having viciously chomped into a can of dreams, the hero displays his beer
    bite (in mouth) and the violated chamber. The applause is overwhelming, as
    are the orthodotia bills.

The Second Encore: A Little Fancy Footwork

1.  To the roar of the crowd, our hero deftly places his foot (and all his
    weight) exactly on top of the can.
2.  Maintaining foot pressure, he quickly strikes both ides simultaneously
    using zen "beetle picer" attack, swiftly pulling fingers back.
3.  The crowd leaps into standing ovation as Budweiser Barishnikov bws out.

Thus concludes chapter 1 of 'The Swiller's Elite Bible'.  Look for other
chapters to be released shortly!
