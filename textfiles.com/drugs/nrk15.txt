    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        A piece of glass is fitted into the bottom of the stopper for the
    flask. To that is placed an eight-inch length of rubber tubing and at
    the end of this is the aerator. Two more pieces of glass is put in the
    top of the stopper.
 
        First, you will need pure alcohol so buy some 100 proof vodka and
    distill it until you have about 12 oz.
 
        Put the alcohol in the flask.Put about two inches of bleach and a
    teaspoon of Sani-Flush in the chlorine bottle. This will generate the
    clorine gas that you will need. Start the clorine through the alcohol
    while the flask is still cold. Watch it carefully to see when the
    alcohol stops absorbing the clorine. Then light a alcohol lamp and
    place it under the 600 ml flask. Keep the flame low until the alcohol
    stops absorbing again. Raise the flame and repeat. Continue this untill
    the alcohol is boiling. Some of the alcohol will distill off into the
    collection bottle. Several times during the process, pour this back
    into the 600 ml beaker.
 
        When the alcohol is totally chlorinated the flask is poured into a
    porcelain dish and allowed to cool. If you have done this right the
    cooled product should be a crystaline mass of unrefined Cloral Hydrate.
 
        Now, pour strong sulfuric acid, three times the volume of the
    Cloral Hydrate, into the pan. Place this pan on your stove over gentle
    heat. When the cloral hydrate is melted, it and the sulfuric acid are
    stirred throughly pour this into the flask and heat again. But this
    time use the thermometer and don't let it get over 200 F.
 
        As the mixture heats up, the still impure cloral hydrate will rise
    to the surface. When it stops rising, use the basting syringe and draw
    the top off of the sulfuric acid. Repeat this until the pan is empty.
 
        Put the cloral hydrate (you drew it off in the last step) into the
    beaker and heat at about 190 F. for 20 minutes. This will get rid of
    any alcohol or acid still in it. Pour this back into the flask and add
    an equal amount of sulfuric acid. Swirl this around to mix it.
 
        Once again you must distill the mixture. But this time it is easy
    since the cloral hydrate will boil at 210 F and the sulfuric acid boils
    at 722 F. When finished pour out the acid, then wash and dry the flask.
    Now, put the powered Calcium Oxide, equal in volume to the cloral
    hydrate into the flask, add the cloral hydrate and distill again. Stop
    as soon as the surface of the oxide is dry.
 
 
        To use, add one part water to two parts { by volume } of the
    finished product. The dose is 1/28th of an oz ( 1 gram ). The best way
    to use this is to put it into a mixed drink, because it has a bitter
    taste. In about 15 minutes, whoever you gave it to is out for the
    night.
