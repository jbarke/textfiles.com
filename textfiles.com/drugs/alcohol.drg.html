     First you must obtain (steal) a holding tank. I recommend those 6 gallon
Alhambra water jugs which are often left on porches and in driveways for
refills.  Just take it off the porch at 3:00 AM and run it home.  Now, put it
where you are going to put your still.  They need to be kept together.  Hide
your still even if you don't have parents that will shit when they see it.
This is illegal by federal law, and you could get busted pretty well.  Make
your still so it is collapsible and you can fit it all into a small box. Hide
the box in your room.  When you are going to use the still, take it out and
hide it behind some bushes where a passing state trooper, snoopy neighbor, or
phed busting you for pirated games won't see it.  Keep the Alhambra jug where
the still is going to be, cause they are way too big to hide anywhere.

     Also, keep your still somewhere with a good breeze or away from people
who will smell it.  When you are fermenting the shit, it will smell like puke
or even worse.  When you are distilling it, your heater might put off smoke.
The alcohol will smell like alcohol, and heated mash smells worse than shit.

     Now go buy a shitload of fresh or frozen whatever (check the list
below).  Frozen corn will be easiest to deal with because it is already cut
off the cob and is very forgiving with beginners.  Besides, it's all part of a
great American tradition: Moonshine!

     Put about 10 bags of corn in each jug and no more, because the carbon
dioxide being released sometime pushes it up and out and you could get the
shit all over the ground. What a waste.  Besides, it will start to rot in the
ground and smell even worse.

     Anyway, add just enough lukewarm water to cover the surface and leave
the stuff exposed to air for about 2 weeks at room temperature.  After a few
days it will bubble and look and smell like puke, but that's no problem.  It
should do that.  Just be sure you've got adequate ventilation.

     Installing a small fan in your Alhambra jug is no problem.  Drilling
holes in the sides of plastic with a sharp drill bit is easy.  Drill two holes
near the top, where there won't be any corn (fans do tend to heat up and short
circuit when exposed to water) and insert two tubes. Make the fan blowing air
into your jug, id nitrogen instead of water
cause it won't speed up the distilling process.  This is what the finished
still should look like:

     A friend of mine was going to be doing a lot of distilling cause he made
a HUGE still.  He was going first- class.  He lived near a creek that stayed
pretty cool, so he was going to figure out how to use that unlimited supply of
water.  The creek grew plenty of bushes, so he hid his still in them.  He even
painted the valves green and stuck them out of the bushes and glued leaves on
to them so nobody could tell it was a still.  But he still didn't have any
water.  He couldn't have a small electric pump, cause he didn't have any
electricity.

     As it turns out, he now has 4 lengths of surgical tubing going down to
the water, around his (superhuge) condenser.  He made a rock and concrete dam
about 3.5 feet high, to get a fast stream of suction.  He  then ran the tubes
down to below the dam, and sucked on them.  He siphons the water up and out of
the creek, through the condenser, and back into the creek.  His still is
awesome!  That thing can run as much as he wants it too, cause he isn't
wasting any water, and it won't show up on any water bill.

     If you are going to be distilling a lot of stuff, you better make a tube
going out of the bottom of the beaker so you can dump out the water and
garbage and every now and then.  Of course, connect it to a valve, so you
won't loose any precious alcohol that's trying to turn into steam in the
beaker.  Make sure any tubes (like this one) aren't made out of glass and can
melt.  It's bad when tubes melt, cause that means you have to rebuild the
still almost from scratch.

     Now that you've got it all set up and the corn (or whatever) is fermented
and hooked up to the beaker, turn the valve on a bit to drip some puke of your
Alhambra jug into your beaker.  Turn on the sterno or bunsen burner to a high
flame so it will heat up the beaker.  Turn on the cold-water valve so you have
cold water flowing around the condenser
