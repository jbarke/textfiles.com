                          Another Oregon NORML file
                             "Escaping the DEA"
                                 Version One
                         ***************************

        It is our mission at Oregon NORML to reform marijuana laws, not break
them. It would be out of our pristine moral bounds to produce a file explaining
how to circumvent law enforcement.

        I have something better.

        The following file is taken verbatim from Vol. 11 "Best of" High Times
magazine. The file (and their article) is an excerpt from The Pennsylvania
Crime Commission's 1991 Annual Report on Drug use.

        Growing cannabis indoors is becoming more popular. This type of
cultivation has traditionally been more common on the West Coast than in the
East. The followingn is a list of indicators and investigative techniques,
adapted from a list compiled by S/A Charles Stowell, DEA Sacramento, CA, and
Detective Rob Ringsage, Oregon State Police, and other material distributed at
the Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program Conference in Nashville,
TN, in February 1991.
