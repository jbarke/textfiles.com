the following are some poems written by Timothy Leary:



		Sheathing the self

The play of energy endures
Beyond striving
The play of energy endures
Beyond body
The play of energy endures
Beyond life.
Out here
Float timeless
Beyond striving.


		The Manifestation of the Mystery

Gazing, we do not see it
we call it empty space.
Listening, we do not hear it.
we call it silence or noise.
Groping, we do not grasp it.
we call it intangible
But here...
   we...spin throught it
   electric,
   silent,
   subtle.


		Please do not clutch at the Gossamer Web

All in Heaven
and on Earth below
Is a crystal fabric...
Delicate Gossamer web
Grabbing hands shatter it
Watch closely this shimmering mosaic
Silent... Glide in harmony.


		The Sex Cakra

Can you float through the univers of your body
and not lose your way?
Can you lie quietly engulfed in the slippery union
of male and female?
Warm wet dance of generation?
Endless ecstasies of couples?
Can you offer your stamen trembling in the meadow
for the electric penetration of pollen
While birds sing?
Writhe together on the river bank,
Wait soft-feathered, quivering, in the thicket?
Can you coil serpentine while birds sing?
Become two cells merging?
Slide together in molecular embrace?
Can you, murmuring,
Lose all
Fusing
Rainbow


		The Moment of fullness

Grab hold tightly,
Let go lightly.

The full cup can take no more.
The candle burns down.
The taut bow must be loosed.
The razor edge cannot long endure
Nor this moment re-lived.

So...now
Grab hold tightly
Now...
Let go lightly
