Rowan Atkinson's HBO Comedy Hour Special.

Following is a report from Marc Midura (marc@claven.cambridge.ibm.com)
on the taping of Rowan Atkinson's HBO COmedy Hour special:
 
I was at HBO's 'On Location' taping of Rowan Atkinson Dec 19 & 20 at
Huntington Theatre in Boston.  It was all 'skits' and approximately 2 hrs long
with breaks.  Most skits were just Rowan Atkinson monologue with 3-4 done
with Angus Deayton.  From what I can remember there were about 10-15 skits
in total.  I thought the performance was hilarious.  One thing that I will
let you in on, because it will be edited out.  While Rowan was performing
his one-man skit (priest giving funeral) with curtain started to fall.
It started to come down slow at first, then sped up.  Everyone thought that
it was going to come down in front of him and be part of the skit.  However
he was standing directly beneath it.  Finally someone in the front yelled,
"Look out!"  and Rowan managed to get out of the way just in time.  He put
on a really strange face and said, "Well, I didn't expect THAT to happen"
and then went on with jokes about the curtain as it related to the skit.

Below is the flier that was given out at the show:
