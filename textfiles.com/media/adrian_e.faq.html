abroad for the Armed Forces, and he lived with his father until the age of
12. He then entered Pocklington Public (i.e. privately-funded) boarding
school, and went off to Manchester University to study Drama. He was in the
same year as Rik Mayall, and eventually got a 2-1 (equivalent to a 'B')...
