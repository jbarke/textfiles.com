	Here is the complete list of every Avengers show ever filmed not
including the New Avengers.  Column One is the season (remember season one
is Police Surgeon with Ian Hendry), column two is the title, column three is
the Production date and column four is the transmission date.   Just a 
reminder, Season 1 was Macnee/Hendry, 2&3 were Macnee/Blackman, 4&5 were
Macnee/Rigg and 6 was Macnee/Thorson.  Episode 25 of season 5 was a crossover
between season 5 and 6.  Seasons 1-4 were black and white while 5 and 6 were
