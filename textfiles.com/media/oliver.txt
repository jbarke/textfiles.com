VIDEO REVIEWS

"ANASTASIA:  THE MYSTERY OF ANNA"   * * * 1/2

In this made-for-TV drama, winner of two Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe
Awards, Amy Irving stunningly portrays Anna Anderson, a woman whose claim 
to be the sole surviving daughter of Czar Nicholas II of Russia remains one 
of the greatest mysteries of the 20th century.

The film alternates between the present day, when Anna realizes who she is
and tries to convince the world of her identity, and flashbacks to the past,
when the Czar's family (supposedly including Anastasia) were brutally 
murdered by revolutionists.

Because nobody knows to this day if Anastasia really did survive the
massacre to surface years later in the form of Anna Anderson, there is no
ending to give away here--only to say that this is a powerful, sweeping
saga, rich in historical lessons and filled with triumph and tragedy.  
This is the epic's only real fault:  the ending is unfulfilling because
there is no ending.  The question asked at the beginning is asked again
at the conclusion:  who is this woman?

On the one hand, she has memories of Anastasia's childhood that,
according to some people who knew her, including her governess, only the
real Anastasia could know.  There is also no reason, other than fame, for
her to lie about her identity--there is no fortune involved, but bitterness
still abounds in Russia for the overthrown Czar's family.  Also, scars
in keeping with a brutal mauling in childhood mar Anna's body.

However, some people see things differently.  Witnesses to the massacre
of the Czar's family claim that there is no way Anastasia could have escaped
or survived.  The family was, according to witnesses, beaten to death, 
their appendages cut off and burned in acid.  And, Anastasia was among them.

Two-time Academy Award winner Olivia de Havilland adds shine to an already
sensational cast.  If you can tolerate never knowing the solution to
a mystery, by all means rent this engrossing film to enjoy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

"THIS IS SPINAL TAP" (re-release)  * * * 1/2

This hilarious romp around the world in a faux rock tour looks so much
like the real thing that you'll begin to wonder, until the band tells you 
that their drummers keep exploding onstage.

The stars here (portrayed by "LaVerne and Shirley"'s Michael McKean and 
former "Saturday Night Live" castmembers Harry Shearer and Christopher 
Guest), look so little like themselves that you won't recognize them.
The British rock star accents are realistic, as are their long hair
and tight pants.

The wit is tight and off-the-cuff; no laugh track.  There is no evidence
here that Spinal Tap is anything but a washed out rock band trying to
make it on the comeback trail.  The songs that they perform onstage
with such seriousness and uproar provide some of the best chuckles--
"Big Bottoms," for one.  Another's lyrics announce, "I wanna get you with
my big pink torpedo."    

Now that Spinal Tap has a new album out (Break Like the Wind), 
I guess they are real, though the performers are still actors, and 
nobody who saw their movie will forget their roots.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

"FOR THE BOYS"  * * *

Bette Midler and James Caan hate each other in this film, but they can't
seem to stay away from one another for their entire lives.  And the chemistry
they share onstage keeps the "boys" (soldiers at war overseas) coming back
for more.

In her Oscar nominated role as a flirty singer given a chance to perform
with Caan's already famous entertainer overseas, Midler is terrific.  This
is the type of film her talent was meant to produce:  singing, dancing,
telling off-color jokes.  

Bitter over the wars themselves after the death of her soldier husband,
Midler continues to be famous with Caan back in the states on their own
TV show.  But wars keep coming, and the stars are always called into the
middle of them.

Midler's son, portrayed by director Mark Rydell's son Christopher, also
becomes a serviceman, only to be cut down in the prime of life in Vietnam.

Although the story here is not as strong as it could be, the song and dance
numbers are solid foot-tappers, and the two stars have a definite chemistry
together.  The movie is also a tad long, illustrating as it does Midler's
entire life from a young woman to an disillusioned, lonely old lady.  
"For The Boys" received its best reviews from adults; children and teenagers
will not appreciate the atmosphere, the message, or the classic songs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

"FATHER OF THE BRIDE"   * * * 1/2

In this remake of the Elizabeth Taylor classic in which she portrayed
the blushing bride, styles have changed and expenses have skyrocketed,
but dear old Dad is still as bewildered by it all as ever.

Steve Martin is stunned when his daughter comes home from Europe with a
BIG announcement: she's getting married.  Her fiance is wonderful, she 
gushes lovingly, and "he's just like you dad, except he's brilliant."

And so begins a hilarious and often touching jaunt through a long,
money hungry, exhausting process that culminates in a few hours that will
join a man and a woman in matrimony.  Those sometimes painful steps leading
up to a foregone conclusion look familiar to some and just plain funny
to most.  The meeting of the bride's and groom's parents for the first
time.  The eccentric wedding consultant.  The spat between the
engaged couple that almost calls the whole thing off.  The viewer is
bound to be as relieved as Martin's character when everything comes off,
although, of course, not exactly as planned.

Entertainment for the whole family, with adults identifying with the
characters and children enjoying both Martin's slapstick antics and
Martin Short's portrayal of the goofy wedding consultant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"THE SUPER"  * * 1/2

Joe Pesci's first banner role is an admirable effort taking on a problem
that is definitely real and brandishing a blatant message without lecturing.

Pesci's character is a would-be slumlord.  His father owns a whole slew of
run-down, inner city apartment buildings, which Pesci stands to inherit.
However, before the old man will bequeath his holdings to his only child,
said child must prove himself by successfully managing one building.
Pesci takes on the challenge, but soon is thwarted by the friendly
neighborhood building inspectors, landing his butt in court.  His sentence?
To live for three months in his building, amidst rodents the size of
poodles, the lack of adequate heat and water, and, oh, yes, the tenants
who don't like him one bit.

As he slowly acclimates himself to the new surroundings and tries to
think of ways to make himself more comfortable without giving in to the
orders to fix up the building, he comes to realize that his tenants are
more than just rent-payers; they are people, living in delapidated
accomodations not fit for dogs.  

Although the ending is kind of obvious and the moral of the story is
clear from the start, this is a must-see for Pesci fans (he can be seen
on other videos such as "Good Fellas" and "Home Alone") and a decent
picture in its own right.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


"OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY"  * * 1/2

Danny DeVito is king of the slimeball roles, and this one is prime.
As a big-city executive who loves only doughnuts and his laptop computer
(and money, of course), DeVito is not even a likeable lug in "Other 
People's Money."  

His computer never fails to tell him of the likely candidates for 
takeover, and the latest victim is to be a wire and cable company in 
New England that is on the verge of bankruptcy.  Only problem is,
the buy-out isn't going to be easy, what with the family-like closeness
of the employees to the boss, and the boss's daughter who just happens
to be a corporate lawyer.

Although this film has many laughs, much of the material is highly
unrealistic, and the budding romantic relationship between DeVito and 
the beautiful young attorney is just TOO unlikely.  "Other People's
Money" is definitely worth renting if you like DeVito, but if you have
trouble identifying with a main character who has not a shred of decency,
you might want to look elsewhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

"DEAD AGAIN"  * * *

In this gripping tale of a man and a woman and the web of mystery and 
intrigue that binds them together, a murder followed by a death sentence
about to be carried out grabs the viewer at the onset.  A famous maestro
is about to be executed for murdering his wife.  The year is 1949.

Then, we catapult to the present day, when an amnestic woman is plagued
with nightmares and mute with apparent fear.  Enter the hero, a ne'er
do well private investigator hired to find her family and identity.
But an ad in the local paper turns up only a seemingly kindly 
hypnotherapist, whose sessions with the dazed woman send them all back
through time.

"Dead Again," a suspenseful tale of reincarnation, entertains well with its
good acting performances and superb plot twists.  A cameo appearance by
Robin Williams also adds to the movie's value.  It's a movie that makes
you think that perhaps an unhappy ending may not be the end.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

"BILLY BATHGATE" * * 1/2

Taking place in the 1940's when mafiosos were in their heyday, "Billy
Bathgate" is an entertaining but only run-of-the-mill gangster movie.

Bathgate gets mixed up with one of the more infamous mobsters of the time,
Dutch Shultz (Dustin Hoffman).  First, he performs odd jobs just to get
the boss's attention.  Then, Shultz begins giving him bigger and better
chores, culminating with the job of babysitting his girlfriend.  

You can guess what happens here--Bathgate falls for the lovely, glamorous
character portrayed by Nicole Kidman.  Actually, there is a lot more to
the story than this, but it's hard to recall amid the frequent acts of
violence.  Shultz's former right-hand man, played by Bruce Willis, for 
instance, is tortured and then given "cement shoes" and thrown off a boat.
Many acting performances here shine, however, and partially make up for
a predictable, sometimes lackluster script.  The ending satisfies; Billy
Bathgate has some memories he will likely remember for the rest of his life.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS MONTH'S "OLDIE BUT GOODIE" PICK--

"EL NORTE"  (1983)  * * * *
Spanish with English Subtitles
Directed by:  Gregory Nava
Zaide Sylvia Gutierrez, David Villalpando

From the first moments of "El Norte," we know that we are in the hands
of a great movie.  It handles itself in such a romantic and poetic way
that we are deeply touched by its story.

The movie tells the story of Rosa and Enrique, two young Guatemalans,
brother and sister, and their long trek up through Mexico to el norte,
the United States.

They begin in a small village and end up in Los Angeles to pursue
the American Dream.  Their father, Arturo, goes to a meeting to
protest working conditions and is killed.  Their mother disappears.
The hero and heroine, who are in their late teens, decide to leave
the village and go to America.

They go by bus and foot up through Mexico, which is as hard on immigrants
from the South as America is.  However, after making it to the border,
are met with roadblocks again and again until finally they crawl
to the promised land through a rodent-infested drainage tunnel.

The two quickly manage to find jobs in the illegal job market and succeed
for a time, until the sad, heartbreaking ending.  Though they initially
live in squalor and work for slave wages, they somehow hold on to their
optimism and belief in their dream.

The movie, with its stunning visual power, steadfastly avoids becoming
a political film despite its portrayal of L.A.'s undocumented workers.
It does so by telling the story solely through the characters' eyes,
and living through them.  

The violent beginning to the film may not be suitable for young children,
but the grandness is something that even teenagers may appreciate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHILDREN'S PICK OF THE MONTH:

"101 DALMATIONS"  * * * 1/2
 (animated)

Recently released on video is this Disney classic, which tells first a 
love story (between two dalmations) and then an adventure story when 
the offspring of said dogs (over a dozen puppies) is kidnapped by the
evil human, Cruella DeVille, who wants to make a bundle by selling them.

Pongo is the hero, who, along with his wife, is heartbroken over the
loss of the pups.  They embark on a journey across England to find and
rescue their babies, but end up rescuing a whole slew of puppies alone with 
them, thus making a grand total of 101 dalmations.

Kids and adults alike won't be able to help but adore Pongo and his gang.
The screenplay is easy enough to follow, yet clever enough to keep the
attention of all but the most finicky viewers.  Rent, watch, and enjoy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OLIVER PREVIEW

To be reviewed in the next issue:  

Oliver Stone's longwinded, controversial "JFK," starring Kevin Costner
in a fact-based role as a southern attorney who refuses to accept the
government's conclusions regarding the assasination and death of John
F. Kennedy.

"Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country," the supposed last journey of
the Enterprise into theaters, at least with Kirk and Company, brings
back the original cast members for one last horrah.  This time their
mission is peace.

AND MORE!!
