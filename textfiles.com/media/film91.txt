Exec. Producers: Michael Cohl, Andre' Picard
Negative Cost: $10 million

tours from 1990 in the 70mm large-frame IMAX format.  The 89 minute film is the
first feature in the format.  It will open at some of the domestic IMAX
and OMNIMAX screens.   The suggested ticket price will be $12 - $15.   European
and Asian engagements will commence in the Spring of 1992.   There are 74
permanent IMAX and OMNIMAX theatres in the world.  Apparently IMAX is having
great difficulty getting the theatres to book this film since a lot of them are
associated with educational and research institutions and they feel a Stones
concert film would not be appropriate.  The California Museum of Science and
Industry in Los Angeles has booked the film.

seventeen, he was tried as an adult, and despite unprecedented public outrage,
he was hanged for a murder he did not commit. This incident eventually led to 
the abolishment of capital punishment in Britain.  Medak directed THE KRAYS, 
Thomas produced THE LAST EMPEROR.

Rating: "R"
Dir: Eric Rochant
Cast: Hippolyte Girardot, Mireille Perrier
Producer: Alain Rocca
Screenplay: Eric Rochant
  A buoyant boy-meets-girl romance that is one of the most acclaimed and
successful debut features to come from France in years.  Set in contemporary
Paris, this film tells the story of a perpetual dropout whose sole interests
are sleeping late, chain-smoking and prowling the Paris streets for new
girlfriends.  He amasses a vast array of female companions due to his
considerable charm.  One day he meets Nathalie, a ravishingly seductive woman
who is extremely smart as well.  They fall in love.  In a lyrical style 
anchored in the French New Wave, Rochant evokes the tentative stabs at romance
made by this very mis-matched pair.

Screenplay: Akira Kurosawa, based on Kiyoko Murata's novel "In the Cauldron"
D.P.s: Takao Saito, Masaharu Ueda
Start Date: 7/3/90, Chichibu, Gotemba, Izu, Nagasaki, Tokyo
  The film tells the tale of a group of four children who spend their summer
vacation with their grandmother, who is a survivor of the atomic bomb dropped
on Nagasaki.  There is a common Japanese belief that the bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki were unjustifiable acts of American terrorism, and had nothing to
do with ending the war.  The youngest child becomes deeply resentful of the
U.S. when he learns that the bomb killed his grandfather.  But his feelings are
confused when an American uncle, played by Richard Gere (speaking Japanese),
visits from Hawaii.   Gere is shocked to learn that his grandmother lost her
husband in the bombing, and asks, on behalf of the U.S., for her forgiveness,
which she happily gives.   
  The film was savaged by foreign journalists at a preview screening in Tokyo,
claiming that Kurosawa was ignoring Japan's role in starting the war by bombing
Pearl Harbor and massacring hundreds of thousands in Nanking and Manila. 
Kurosawa explained that he was not attempting to defend Japan's role in the
war.  "This is a film about a family - not war or peace".   The moral of the
tale was intended to be that it is the leaders of countries, and not the
ordinary people, who are responsible for wars.

Start Date: 8/20/90, Los Angeles
  Theresa Russell is an L.A. prostitute who takes on a sordid assortment of
men in cars.  She gives a running commentary of her experiences directly to the
camera.  Apparently this film lacks the usual style and verve of Ken Russell's
projects.  The filmmakers are very distraught by the rating, as they feel that
all of the young women who were captivated by PRETTY WOMAN should see this
film, which is far more realistic.

Negative Cost: $31 million
  This biopic headlining Downey as Charlie Chaplin has jumped from 
Universal to Carolco.   This story of his life begins with his impoverished
youth in London, continues with his major achievements during Hollywood's
Golden Age, his fears concerning "talkies", his conflicts with J. Edgar Hoover,
his exile from America and his brief, triumphant return to accept his special
Academy Award.   Downey will age from 19 to 83 in the process.   Aykroyd plays
Mack Sennett (of Keystone Kops fame), Geraldine Chaplin plays her real
grandmother, Hannah Chaplin.  Jovovich (RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON) is Mildred
Harris, Chaplin's child actress first wife.  Kelly (THE CUTTING EDGE, THE BOY

elder half-brother Sydney who became Charlie's business manager after abandoning
his own acting career.  Tomei (OSCAR) plays early silent screen star Mabel 
Normand and Travis (AIR AMERICA) is would-be actress Joan Barry, who almost 
destroyed Chaplin.

Goodall, Amber Scott, Dick Monahan

Screenplay: Jim V. Hart, Malia Scotch Marmo
D.P.: Dean Cundey
Start Date: 2/19/91, Los Angeles
Negative Cost: $68 million
  In this sequel to PETER PAN, Hoffman is Capt. Hook, Williams is a grown-up
Peter Pan (attorney), Roberts is Tinker Bell, Hoskins is Smee and Smith is Gran
Wendy.  Capt. Hook and Peter now fight as 35-year old equals.  Film features 
spectacular sets and Visual Effects from ILM.  Aa Tinker Bell, Roberts will 
not work with any of the rest of the cast, but in front of a bluescreen.  Her 
wings will be animated separately and matted into her shots.   Huge outlook.  
Spielberg last directed INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE.   Film is way 
over budget and schedule.  Outrageous contract terms for Spielberg and Messrs 
Hoffman and Williams have the trio taking more of the revenue than TriStar!   
(About 40% of the gross).  Some have speculated that the film would have to
gross some $500 million to break even!   (That's somewhat inflated, methinks).
Carrie Fisher wrote Tinkerbell's dialogue and also did a script polish.  
They will have a heckuva time meeting the December 11th date, so there has 
been talk of a 12/18 or 12/25 opening.   The producers are adamant about 
releasing the film this year, though.  (Visions of Oscars dancing in their 
heads?)    The producers plan to release HOOK in formats galore: 70mm SR, 70mm
Dolby A, 70mm CDS, 35mm SR, 35mm Dolby A, 35mm CDS.

  This action comedy has had a very difficult gestation.  Willis is

the story is good.)   There are FIVE effects houses working on this one,
including ILM, Fantasy II Film Effects, 4-Ward Prods. and Stan Winston, Inc. 
ILM's computer graphics division hired 20 new programmers just for this
project and had to make an investment of over $3 million to win the contract!

now. ) A cyborg killing machine is sent back in time to kill hero John Connor 
while  is still and infant.  If it succeeds, three billion people will die in a 
nuclear holocaust on Judgement Day: August 29, 1997.  One of the all-time
boxoffice performers in its early stages of release.   Opened in the U.K. on
August 16 breaking most existing boxoffice records with similarly glowing

RECKLESS KELLY						1992
Dir: Yahoo Serious

Producers: Yahoo Serious, Warwick Ross
Screenplay: Yahoo Serious
Start Date: 9/91, Australia
  Why would Warner Brothers finance another picture from Yahoo Serious after

inexpensive, and he is very popular Down Unde, that's why.

Rating: "PG"
Dir: Kevin Reynolds

Elizabeth Mastrantonio
Producers: Pen Densham, John Watson, Richard B. Lewis
Screenplay: Pen Densham, John Watson
D.P.: Doug Milsome
Start Date: 9/6/90, England, France
Negative Cost: $60 million
  A huge-scale, rather comic look at the legend of Robin Hood and his merry
men.  This production boasts the hottest name in filmdom today in
Costner.  Freeman is his sidekick.  Rickman, the perfect heavy, is the Sheriff
of Nottingham.  Mastrantonio makes a fetching Maid Marion.  This is the second
entrant in the battle of the Robin Hoods (three different attempted
productions, two actually made).  Now it's up to the public to decide.... 
Opens on 2100 screens.  Sneaked in Sacramento on 3/27 with the best preview results 
in Warner Brothers history.  68% of the preview cards rated it "excellent", 30%
were "very good".  Film re-cut in May due to Mr. Rickman "stealing the show" as
the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Opens in London on July 19.  Recorded in Q-Sound. 
From Morgan Creek.

works in his firm.  The clerk gives the broker a crash course in the wilder
side of life and helps him meet the girl of his dreams -- in exchange for a leg
up on the corporate ladder.  Hooks is a two-time Emmy Award winner and the son
of actor Robert Hooks.  Musical score is by Michael Colombier (NEW JACK CITY).
Formerly titled GO NATALIE.

  Ellen Barkin plays a Madison Avenue Male Chauvinist who dies and is

UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD     2.35	     70mm	December 25
Dir: Wim Wenders					(NY, LA, Toronto)
Cast: William Hurt, Solveig Dommartin, Max von Sydow, Jeanne Moreau, Rudiger
Vogler, Sam Neill, Ernie Dingo, David Gulpilil, Lois Chiles, Allen Garfield
Producers: Jonathan Taplin, Anatole Dauman
Screenplay: Wim Wenders, Peter Carey
D.P.: Robby Muller
Start Date: 4/20/90, Venice Italy, France, Portugal, U.S., Japan, Australia,
Germany, USSR, China, Mali
Negative Cost: $23 million
  A huge-scale science fiction romance/road story filmed around the 
world in nine countries by Berlin's great Wim Wenders.  This futuristic (set 
in 1999) thriller concerns a man's efforts to retrieve a valuable invention 
(a device to permit blind people to see recorded images) and a woman's pursuit
of the mysterious man she loves.   Moreau plays Hurt's blind mother, Von Sydow 
is his father. Production was to have been in 65mm, but the demanding location 
requirements resulted in a 35mm production.  Title song is by the Irish group 
U2.  Other acts on the soundtrack include Neneh Cherry, Lou Reed, R.E.M., Patti
Smith, Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson. Early notices are quite positive 
on some aspects, but mixed on others.   Film runs a epic 178 minutes and 
apparently seems somewhat truncated at that length.  Wenders also has a 
five-hour cut that he would like to make the film festival rounds and on home 
video.  Opened in Germany to mixed business in September.  Reviews in Berlin 
were dreadful, they loved it in Munich.

WHITE SANDS						1992

Emmet Walsh, Samuel L. Jackson
Producers: William Sackheim, Scott Rudin
Screenplay: Daniel Pyne
D.P.: Peter Menzies
Start Date: 8/13/91, New Mexico
  This thriller features Dafoe as a small-town sheriff whose seemingly 
routine investigation into a murder balloons into an intricate plot involving 
the FBI and the CIA.

POISON	     1.85					April 5 (NY)
Dir: Todd Haynes
Cast: Edith Meeks, Larry Maxwell, Susan Gayle Norman, Scott Renderer, James
Lyons
Producer: Christine Vachon
Screenplay: Todd Haynes, based on stories by Jean Genet
D.P.: Maryse Alberti
Start Date: 1990, New York
  Todd Hayne's hugely controversial film was underwritten by the NEA. 
Bible-thumpers are complaining about the homo-erotic moments in the film (sight
unseen).  Film involves three separate interrelated stories inspired by the
works of Jean Genet, about obsession, fantasy and violence.  Opens at New
York's Angelika Film Center.  Brilliant winner of the Sundance Film Festival.
