        General Information:
                Audience instructions are in square brackets.  Text in quotes
                is to be shouted.  The instruction 'Echo' indicates that the
                following line is to be shouted in unison with the film.

                Whenever Brad appears, or is introduced in some way
                the line "Asshole!" is appropriate.
                When Janet is introduced or appears, the line "Slut!" is
                appropriate, or you prefer...
                the line "Nice" (Nissss)is appropriate to Janet.  Whenever
                Narrator (Charles Gray) appears, the following lines and
                variants are appropriate: "He's got no fucking neck!";
                "Bo-ring!"; "Charles Gray, he's O.K.!".  Dr. Scott may be booed,
                but it's also appropriate to yell "Kiss Ass!".

            then the grandparents. Just of the close family.  Ahhh,
            hold that.  Beautiful.  And... (snap)

Ralph:      I guess we finally did it, huh. ["Hit him, Hit him back"]

Brad:       I don't think there's any doubt about that. You and Betty have
            been almost inseparable since you met in Dr. Scott's refresher
            class.

Ralph:      Well to tell you the truth, Brad, that's the only reason I
            showed up in the first place. (chuckles)

Betty:      O.K. you guys, this is it. (everyone screams)

Ralph:      Well Betty's going to throw the bouquet.  [throw BOUQUET]

Janet:      ["Catch it, Janet!"] or ["Hey Janet, do you have Herpes?"]
            I got it!  I got it!

Ralph:      Hey big fella, looks like it could be your turn next, eh?

Brad:       Who knows. ["The Shadow knows!", or "Who Cares!"]

Ralph:      Well, so long, see you Brad.  Guess we better get get going now Bett
            Come on, hop in.  (they drive away)

            ["Be just and fear not" when sign appears]

Janet:      Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful?  ["No!"]
            Wasn't Betty radiantly beautiful? ["No!"]
            I can't believe it.  An hour ago she was just plain old Betty Monroe
            and now...
            ["Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapshatt!"] now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapshatt.
            ["I'd rather be Betty Monroe!", or "Half-shit! (will travel)"]

Janet:      Yes.

Dentonian:  I always cry at weddings.
            ["So do I!" or "What the fuck do you do at funerals, bitch?!" or
            "and laugh at funerals"]

Brad:       Everyone knows that Betty is a wonderful little cook.
            ["Yes, and she's a great little fuck, too!"]

Janet:      Yes.

Brad:       Why Ralph himself, he'll be up for a promotion in a year or two.
            ["If he doesn't get busted!"]

            [when Denton sign is in view... "Denton Denton Rah Rah Rah,
            Denton Denton eat me raw, Yeah Denton!"]

Janet:      Yes.


            DAMMIT JANET

            ["Brad, what do you say when you want to fuck"]

Brad:       Hey Janet.

            ["Sit on my face and wiggle"]

Janet:      Yes Brad?

Brad:       I've got something to say.

            ["Then say it asshole"]

Janet:      Uh huh.

Brad:       I really love the... ["Starts with an S..." or "Slimy, scuzzy,
            scummy"] skillful way ["you give head"]... you beat
            the other girls... ["With whips and chains?"]
            to the bride's bouquet. ["that too"]

Janet:      Oh Brad.

            ["Sing it, Brad!(Asshole)"]
            [audience echoes 'Janet's, 'Oh Brad's, 'Dammit, Janet's]

             repeat whenever necessary]

Brad:       The river was deep but I swam it. (Janet)
            The future is ours so let's plan it. (Janet)
            So please, don't tell me to can it. (Janet)
            I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet I love you.

            The road was long but I ran it. (Janet)
            There's a fire in my heart and you fan it. (Janet)
            If there's one fool for you then I am it. (Janet)
            I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet I love you.

            Here's a ring to prove that I'm no joker.
            There's three ways that love can grow. ["sex sex and sex"]
            That's good, bad, or mediocre.
            Oh, J-A-N-E-T I love you so.
            ["Don't drop it!"]

Janet:      Oh, it's nicer than Betty Monroe had. (Oh Brad)
            Now we're engaged and I'm so glad (Oh Brad)

            That you met Mom and you know Dad. (Oh Brad)
            [echo "That you fuck Mom and you blow Dad."]

            I've one thing to say and that's Brad, I'm mad, for you too.
            [echo "For a screw" over "for you too"]

            Oh Brad...


Brad:       Oh... dammit.
            [echo "Aw shit" over "Oh... dammit"]

Janet:      I'm mad...

Brad:       Oh, Janet.
            [echo "Aw shit" over "Oh, Janet"]

Janet:      For you.

Brad:       I love you too.
            [echo "I love to screw-ew-ew."]

Brad & Janet: There's one thing left to do - ah - oo.
            [echo "that's screw" over "ah - oo"]

Brad:       And that's go see the man who began it. (Janet)
            When we met in his science exam - it (Janet)
            Made me give you the eye and then panic. (Janet)
            Now I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet, I love you.
            Dammit, Janet.

Janet:      Oh Brad, I'm mad. [echo "You fag" over "I'm mad"]

Brad:       Dammit, Janet.

Brad & Janet: I love you. [echo "I love screw"]

            ["the man in the next scene has NO FUCKING NECK"]

Narrator:   I would like, ["You would, would you?"]
            ah, if I may, ["You may not!"] ...to take you on a
            strange journey.  ["How strange"]

            (goes for black book) ["No! not the black book!" Scream]

            (opens book) ["Three pages to the asshole"]
            [as pages turn "one. two. two and a half."]
            It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors ["asshole"]
            his fiancee Janet Weiss ["slut"], two young, normal, healthy kids,
            left Denton ["Denton Denton, rah rah rah, Denton Denton, eat
            me raw, Yeah Denton"]
            that late November evening, to visit a Dr. Everett Scott, ex-tutor,
            now friend to both of them.
            ["Is it true that you fuck chickens?" or some other question]
            It's true there were dark storm clouds.
            ["Adjectives, please!" or "Describe your balls!"]
            heavy, black, and pendulous, towards which they were driving.
            ["It it also true that you rape boys?" or some other question]
            It's true, also, that the spare tire they were carrying
            was badly in need of some air, but, uh, they being normal kids, on a
            night out... well, they weren't going to let a storm spoil the rest
            their evening, were they?  ["What kind of night was it?"]
            ...On a night out... ["WHAT kind of night?"] it was a night out
            they were going to remember... ["How long?"] for a very long time.

            [move hands as if they were windshield wipers]

            [echo stuff to Nixon speech....]

            ["How many motorcylces has that been Janet (Slut)?"]

Janet:      Gosh, that's the third motorcycle that's passed us.
            ["The Bitch (slut) can count."]
            They sure do take their lives in their hands, what with the
            weather and all.

            ["Say something stupid, Brad(Asshole)!"]
Brad:       Yes, life's pretty cheap to that type. ["Asshole!" or
            echo "so's Janet" after "life's pretty cheap"]

Janet:      Oh. ...What's the matter, Brad darling?

            ["I came on the windshield"]

Brad:       We must have taken the wrong fork a few miles back. ["You took the
            salad fork!"]

Janet:      Oh, but where did those motorcycles come from?

            ["Japan", or "Kawasaki", etc.]

Brad:       Hmmm... well I guess we'll just have to turn back.
                    ["Don't back up!"]  (BOOM)

Janet:      Oh! What was that bang?

Brad:       We must have a blowout.  DAMMIT! ["Janet!" clap hands]
            I knew I should have
            gotten that spare tire fixed. ["Asshole!"]  Well, you just stay here
            keep warm and I'll go for help.

Janet:      But where will you go in the middle of nowhere?

Brad:       ["Try the castle!"] ...Didn't we pass a castle back down the road
            a few miles?  [Cheer] Maybe they have a telephone we could use.
            ["Castles don't have telephones, asshole!" repeat when appropriate]

Janet:      I'm going with you.

Brad:       Oh, no, darling, there's no sense in both of us getting wet.

            ["She's allready wet!"]

Janet:      I'm coming with you!  Besides darling, the owner of that phone
            might be a beautiful woman, ["He is!"] and you might never come back

Brad:       Heh, heh, heh, heh.

            [they get out of the car "Kick it!".  NEWSPAPERS over heads, squirt
             the virgins sitting in front of you]

            OVER AT THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE

Janet:      In the velvet darkness,
            Of the blackest night,
            Burning bright, ["What's up your ass?"] there's a guiding star.
            No matter what or who you are.

Brad & Janet: There's a light... [light MATCHES on 'light']

Chorus:     Over at the Frankenstein place.

Brad & Janet: There's a light...

Chorus:     Burning in the fireplace...

            [MATCHES out on 'darkness' - "Darkness!" if any lights still on]
Brad & Janet: There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life.

            ["Sing it, Riff (Raff)!"]
Riff Raff:  The darkness must go down the river of night's dreaming.
            Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming
            Into my life.  Into my life...

Brad & Janet: There's a light...  [MATCHES again]

Chorus:     Over at the Frankenstein place.

Brad & Janet: There's a light...

Chorus:     Burning in the fireplace.
            There's a light, a light

Brad & Janet: [off at 'Darkness'] ...in the darkness of everybody's life.

}  (in the stage version right after the first chorus Brad has this extra verse:
}
}Brad:       I can see the flag fly
}            I can see the rain
}            Just the same, there has got to be
}            Something better here for you and me.
}
}            (repeat chorus))

Narrator:   And so, it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet
            ["unlike your neck"] and
            that they had found the assistance that their plight required.
            ["Are you sure?"] ...Or had they?

Janet:      Brad, let's go back, I'm cold and frightened...

Brad:       Just a moment Janet, they might have a phone.

            ["ding dong, asshole calling, wanna buy some asshole cookies?"]
            (doorbell rings, door creaks open)

Riff Raff:  Hello. ["Hello"]

Brad:       Hi! My name is Brad Majors, and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.
            I wonder if you could help us.  You see, our car broke down
            a few miles up the road... do you have a phone we might use?

Riff Raff:  You're wet. ["No shit, Sherlock!"]

            ["Janet, are you a slut?"]
Janet:      Yes - it's raining. ["No shit, Janet!"]

            ["Brad, are you an asshole?"]
Brad:       Yes.

            ["Riff, do you fuck your sister?"]
Riff Raff:  Yes... I think perhaps you better both ["Fuck off"] come inside.
            ["Better than cuming outside!" or "I don't care where you cum"]

Janet:      ["How kind is he?"] You're too kind. ["No, he's not"]
            Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of a place is this?

Brad:       Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

Janet:      Oh (forlornly)

Riff Raff:  ["Which way (do you fuck your sister)?"] This way.

            ["Follow the bouncing thumb"]

Janet:      Are you having a party?

            ["What kind of night is it?"]

Riff Raff:  You've arrived on a very special night.  It's one of the
            master's affairs. ["Which one?"]

Janet:      Oh lucky him.

            [echo next line ("You're lucky... ha ha ha ha ha")]
Magenta:    You're lucky, He's lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky! ha ha ha ha ha

            (- seven dongs -)   [don't ask -ed.]


            THE TIME WARP

            [if you aren't in the aisle by now, get in the aisle and
            crouch down]

Riff Raff:  It's astounding;
            Time is fleeting; ["What's your favorite rock group?"]
            Madness takes its toll.
            But listen closely...

            ["For how long?"]
Magenta:    Not for very much longer.

Riff Raff:  I've got to keep control.
            I remember doing the time-warp ["Kick! Kick!"]
            Drinking those moments when
            The darkness would hit me

Riff & Magenta: And a void would be calling...

            [get up and time warp!]

Transylvanians: Let's do the time-warp again.
            Let's do the time-warp again.

            ["How's it done?"]
            [Here are the instructions: DO IT!]

Narrator:   It's just a jump to the left.

All:        And then a step to the right.

Narrator:   With your hands on your hips. [echo "tits" over "hips"]

All:        You bring your knees in tight.
            But it's the pelvic thrust   ["oooo ahhh" with each thrust]
            That really drives you insane.

            Let's do the time-warp again.

Frank & Transylvanians: In just seven days I can make you a man.

Frank:      I don't want no dissention, just dynamic tension.

Janet:      I'm a muscle fan.

Frank:      In just seven days, I can make you a man

Narrator:   There are those that say that life is an illusion ["like your neck"]
            and that reality is but a figment of the imagination.
            ["Like your neck"] If this is so, then Brad and Janet are
            quite safe ["with their necks"], ... however, the sudden departure
            of their host...and his creation...into the seclusion of his somber
            bridal suite [echo "Sweet" up high] had left them feeling both
            ["Horny!"] apprehensive and a feeling which grew ["unlike your
            neck"] as the other guests departed, and they were
            shown to their separate rooms.

            (Janet and Brad are shown to their rooms by Riff Raff and Magenta.)
            ["Pink is for Sluts... watch out for the basin ...
            He knows when you are sleeping, he knows when you're awake...

Janet:      Uhh! Who is it? Who's there?

            ["Have no fear, Frank the wonderfuck is here, part one"]
Frank (Brad): It's only me, Janet.

Janet:      Oh, Brad darling, come in.
            ["She said come in, not come on"]
            Oh! Brad Oh Brad.  Yes, my darling...but what if...

Frank (Brad): It's all right, Janet, everything's going to be alright.
            ["Don't touch his hair!" or "Don't fuck with the hair"]

Janet:      Oh, I hope so, my darling.  Oh...Ah...ahh OHHH! Oh it's you!
            ["We told you not to fuck with the hair!"]

Frank:      I'm afraid so, Janet, but isn't it nice...

Janet:      Oh, you beast, you monster...Oh what have you done with Brad?

Frank:      Oh, well, nothing.  Why, do you think I should?

Janet:      You tricked...I wouldn't have...I've never..never...
            ["What about the football team", answer "That was just practice"]

Frank:      Yes, yes I know, but it isn't all bad, is it?  ["It isn't all
            Brad either!"] I think you really found it quite pleasurable.

Janet:      Oh, stop...I mean help...Brad Brad!..Oh Brad!!
            ["He's not down there!"]

Frank:      Shhh. Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you
            like...This!

Janet:      Like this..like how??! Oh, it's your fault...you're to blame...Oh...
            I was saving myself...

Frank:      Yes, but I'm sure you're not SPENT yet...

Janet:      Promise you won't tell Brad?

Frank:      Cross my heart and hope to die...

Frank (Janet): Oh, Brad darling, it's no good here.  He'll destroy us.

Brad:       Don't worry Janet, we'll be away from here in the morning.

Frank (Janet): Oh, Brad you're so strong and protective.

Frank:      Nothing.  Why?  Do you think I should?  ["Liar!"]

Brad:       You tricked me, I wouldn't have...never...never...never...
            ["What about the boy scout troup?"]

Frank:      Oh Yes yes, I know...but it isn't all bad, is it?  Not even half
            bad, I think you really quite enjoyed it.

            (Brad starts moaning)

Frank:      Oh... so soft...

Brad:       Stop it...stop it...oh Janet...JANET!

Frank:      Shhh! Janet's probably asleep by now, do you want her to see you...
            like...this.

Brad:       Like this, like how? It's your fault, you're to blame, I thought
            it was the real thing! ["It is!"]

Frank:      Oh come on, Brad, admit it, you liked it, didn't you?  It isn't
            a crime to give yourself over to pleasure, Brad.
            ["Not in this state!"]
            We've wasted so much time already. Janet needn't know, I won't tell.

Narrator:   Emotion, agitation or disturbance of the mind...Vehement or excited
            mental state. It is also a powerful and irrational master...and from
            what Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their television monitor
            there seemed little doubt that Janet was, indeed, ... its slave.

Magenta and Columbia: [echo] Tell us about it, Janet.


            TOUCH-A TOUCH-A TOUCH-A TOUCH ME

Janet:      I was feeling done in, couldn't win
            I'd only ever kissed before.

Columbia:   You mean she...

Magenta:    Uh huh

Janet:      I thought there's no use getting
            Into heavy petting
            It only leads to trouble
            And seat wetting.
            [stand up, look at your seat, "oh shit, my seat's wet."]
            Now all I want to know is how to go.
            I've tasted blood and I want more.

Magenta and Columbia: [echo] More, more, more

Janet:      I'll put up no resistance
            I want to go the distance
            I've got an itch to scratch
            I need assistance.

      [when Rocky goes between Janet's legs: "This looks like a good place for
        a stick up." or "Something smells fishy here."]

            Then if anything grows, while you pose,
            I'll oil you up and rub you down.

Magenta and Columbia: ["up"] Down, ["up"] down, ["up"] down. ["up"]

Janet:      And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction
            You need a friendly hand and I need action.

Columbia:   Toucha toucha toucha touch me
Magenta:    I want to be dirty.
Columbia:   Thrill me, chill me, fulfil me,

Brad:       Hey, Scotty! ["Beam me up, this planet sucks!"] Dr. Everett Scott.

Riff Raff:  You know this earthling ["You fucked up!"] ...this person?

Brad:       Why yes.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.

Frank:      I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here
            with a purpose.

Brad:       I told you, my car broke down.  I was telling the truth.
            ["assholes don't lie"]

Frank:      I know what you told me...but this Dr. Everett Scott, his name
            is not unknown to me.

Brad:       He was a science teacher at Denton High School.

Frank:      And now he works for your government, doesn't he, Brad? he's
            attached to the bureau of investigation of that which you call
            UFO's [echo "You Ass-hole"]
            Isn't that right, Brad?

Brad:       He might be...I don't know.

Riff Raff:  The intruder is entering the building, master.

         ["Now what room is he in? the bathroom? the bedroom? the green room?"]
Frank:      He'll probably be...entering the Zen room. ["The Zen Room! Shit! I

Dr. Scott:  Frankenfurter, we meet at last.

Brad:       Dr. Scott!

Dr. Scott:  Brad! What are you doing here?

Frank:      Don't play games, Dr. Scott.  You know perfectly well what
            Brad Majors is doing here.  It was part of your plan, was it not?
            That he and his female should check the layout for you.  well,
            unfortunately for you, all your plans are to be changed.  You must
            be adaptable, Dr. Scott; I know Brad is.
            ["You promissed you wouldn't tell"]

Dr. Scott:  I can assure you that Brad's presence here comes as a complete
            surprise to me.  I came here to find Eddie.

Brad:       Eddie!  I've seen him!

Frank:      Eddie!  What do you know of Eddie, Dr. Scott?

            ["Get conceited!"]
Dr. Scott:  I happen to know a great deal about a lot of things.  You see
            Eddie happens to be my ["sex life"] nephew.

Narrator:   And so, by some extraordinary co-incidence, fate, it seemed,
            had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment
            with their friend, Dr. Everett Scott.  But it was to be in a
            situation which none of them would have possibly forseen.
            And, just a few hours after announcing their engagement,
            Brad and Janet had both tasted ["Frank N Furter"]
            ...forbidden fruit.  ["Same thing!"] This in itself was proof
            that their host was a man of of little morals ["Yay little morals"]

            further indignities were they to be subjected to?

            ["What indeed?"] What indeed? ["my thoughts exactly!"]
            From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be

            To start a-working on a muscle man.
            Now the only thing that gives me hope ["Is smoking dope"]

Rocky:      I'm just seven hours old, ["And can't dance"]

            The game has been disbanded; my mind has been expanded.
            It's a gas that Frankie's landed!
