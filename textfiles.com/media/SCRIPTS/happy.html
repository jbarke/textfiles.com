{15 SECONDS OF SCREAMING GUITAR PUNK MUSIC.  VERY VERY LOUD!}

[FX: CRASH, GLASS BREAKING, MUSIC CRUMBLES TO A STOP]

MIKE:   Vyvyan, Why did you just throw the band out of the window?

VYV:    Oh, sorry Mike. I was forgetting myself!

NEIL:   Oh wow! Yeah, Yeah I do that all the time. Like, sometimes
        I wake up in the morning and think, like, "What's that inside
        my trousers?", and then, like, about half an hour later I 
        remember it's me... Neil.

[FX: THUMP]

MIKE:   Now that's a very interesting sound effect Vyv! Now, go on,
        do it again!

VYV:    Well, I would Michael, but unfortunately Neil's only got one
        head.

[FX: DOOR OPENING]

RICK:   {laugh} Good Morning everybody!  Let's make Rock & Roll history!

VYV:    Oh no, he's found us...

RICK:   {laugh} Hey! Great gag about telling me the recording studio
        was in Wales! {laughs again}

MIKE:   O.K. guys! Now get out your instruments. And I don't mean...

RICK:   Uh! Uh! Uh! Michael! Remember, we promised Cliff we wouldn't be
        rude!

MIKE:   It's time to record the flip side.

RICK:   Yes {laugh} And if we don't hurry up, it really will be a flip
        side! Because I probably say something crazy like: "Blummin' 
        flip, let's get on with it!".

MIKE:   Neil! Where's your guitar?

NEIL:   Oh great! uh, Pop Quiz. Right, um, hang on, hang on, I know 
        this... aaaahhhhhhhh, ohhh, it's on the tip of my tongue...

VYV:    Wwwwwwwellllllll, What a stupid place to keep your guitar!

RICK:   Oh blummin' flip, Vyvyan, let's get on with it!

MIKE:   We ARE getting on with it, Rick!

RICK:   Well just about make sure you blinkin' well blummin' well DO
        matey flip, because one thing's for death: When this kid's 
        in the studio, it's get down jive time all the way to number 
        one, so...
        [FX: SAXOPHONE]
        Ha ha! Ha ha! UUUmph! 
        {saxophone is shoved down his throat}

MIKE:   Vyvyan, We were gonna use that saxophone!

VYV:    Well, I just did, didn't I Michael?

[FX: RICK COUGHING UP SAXOPHONE, LOW TO HIGH PORTAMENTO]

RICK:   Oh! What a great tasting saxophone, Vyvyan!

VYV:    Well, if you think that's great, get a taste of this!

NEIL:   Oh good, you found my guitar Vyv!

[FX: GUITAR IS SMASHED, PRESUMABLY ON RICK'S HEAD]

NEIL:   Oh no, guys, guys! Look, I thought pop music was supposed 
        to be about, like, loving each other...

MIKE:   No, Neil, no, that's sex.  Pop music is about making money.
        Now go next door and pinch Simon LeBon's guitar.

NEIL:   Oh alright...uh, Mr LeBum! Mr LeBum!
        {he walks off}

[FX: DOOR CLOSES]

RICK:   Great! We got rid of the hippy!  Brilliant! More singing
        for me! Right! {sings} Get down! & Get WIIIIIIITH it!
        One, aTwo, aThree...

VYV:    Do you want to hear my new joke??

RICK:   N-o.  aOne, aTwo, aOneTw...

VYV:    Look, Rick.  Do...
[FX: VYV PUNCHING RICK]
        You...
[FX: VYV PUNCHING RICK]
        Want...
[FX: VYV PUNCHING RICK]
        To...
[FX: VYV PUNCHING RICK]
        Hear...
[FX: VYV PUNCHING RICK]
        My...
[FX: VYV PUNCHING RICK]
        New...
[FX: VYV PUNCHING RICK, RICK CRYING]
        JOKE!!!!
[FX: VYV PUNCHING RICK, RICK SOBBING LIKE A TOTAL AND UTTER GIRLY]

RICK:   ...ah huh huh, Do you know what? I do now Vyvyan.

VYV:    Alright! Get ready to laugh 'coz here it comes!

[FX: VYV MUNCHING AWAY ON SOMETHING]

RICK:   Vyvyan, eating a pair of trousers is NOT funny. Especially
        when they're my dungarees.

VYV:    Well, do you want them back then? {starts to throw up}

RICK:   Oh No! No! No!

[FX: DOOR OPENS]

NEIL:   I'm Back!

OTHERS: Phew! What a wiff!

NEIL:   Rick, why haven't you got any trousers on??

RICK:   Because Vyvyan's turned into a comedian, Neil.
        {laugh} Um, Actually, {laughs again} that's a point Neil.
        Why don't you ask Vyvyan to tell you his great new joke.

NEIL:   Oh, alright.  Uh, Vyvyan, why don't you tell me your great 
        new joke?

VYV:    O.K. Neil. Get ready to laugh, here it comes!

[FX: VYV MUNCHING AWAY ON SOMETHING]

NEIL:   Uh, yeah, that's really great Vyvyan!

RICK:   Vyvyan, eating my underpants is even less funny than eating
        my trousers!

VYV:    {coughing} Oh God! You're not kidding!

RICK:   {desperate} Oh god, Neil, Give me your trousers!

NEIL:   No! Get off, get off, these are my trousers & I'm sticking
        to them!

RICK:   TAKE OFF YOUR TROUSERS!!!

NEIL:   No, no I can't. Vyvyan put superglue in them.

VYV:    That was three years ago Neil!

NEIL:   Well how often do you change YOUR trousers.

MIKE:   Don't worry Neil, it isn't a problem. Taking trousers off is
        very easy.

RICK:   {laugh} Yes it is, except that I'm more used to taking off DRESSES!

VYV:    What, you wear alot of dresses then do you Rick?

RICK:   Yes I do.  I... NO! That's not what I meant Vyvyan and you know it!
        All I'm saying is that girls find me terrifically sexy, and 
        they often ask me to take their dresses off.

VYV:    THAT IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER LIE!!

RICK:   It is not!! Alright then, look at my love bite.

VYV:    That isn't a love bite! That's your bottom!

RICK:   Alright then, what's it doing on my face??

NEIL:   {muffled} No that's not YOUR face, what's it doing on MY face??

MIKE:   Now come on guys! We're running out of time.  Let's get on with the
        important business, shall we??

VYV:    You're right, Michael.  Neil's trousers must be removed, and NOW!

[FX: RIPPING]

NEIL:   No, ow, wo, ow!  OH NO! What are those two horrible pale
        hairy things?

MIKE:   Those are your legs, Neil.  Now look, are we gonna sing this
        song or not?

VYV:    Yes we are.  But first....   LET'S HAVE A FIGHT!!

OTHERS: Yes, Oh wow!, Great idea, etc...

[FX: MULTITUDINOUS PUNCHES BEING THROWN]

VYV:    Umph, oh, take that etc...
NEIL:   oh, touche, take that, OW!
RICK:   etc...
MIKE:   etc...

{Pause...  Vyvyan panting... }

RICK:    Right!

[FX: MULTITUDINOUS PUNCHES BEING THROWN]

NEIL:   Ooof, Bam, Ow, Oooh...
RICK:   Oooh, Oh dear, Oh God, look at the mess!
VYV:    etc...
MIKE:   etc...

{Punches stop}

VYV:    Well, That was great.  Now, Let's do the song.  Here I go!

{12 SECONDS OF GUITAR INTRO}

ALL:    {singing to quiet electric guitar accompaniment}
        All the little flowers are singing
        All the little birdies are too          {VYV: tweet tweet tweet}
        Everything in the garden is happy,
        And we hope you are too                 {VYV: o-oo o-oo}
        If you're happy we're happy             {VYV: laughs}
        If you're sad we're sad                 {VYV & RICK: Boo hoo}
        But now it's time to end this song,
        'coz it's so fucking bad!

RICK:   Goodnight children...
MIKE:   Goodnight.
NEIL:   Hello, um, goodnight.
VYV:    Pass the detonator...

[FX: HUGE EARTH SHATTERING EXPLOSION]
