* March 1993 Edition *

A while ago I said I'd try to compile a list of mail-order places for
everyone's convenience. Here is an update including more recent
postings.  Please email or post additions, corrections, and comments
relevant to the various categories. I am also interested in listing
places to avoid. I intend to post this FAQ monthly, and I also plan
to set this up with news.answers just as soon as I get my act together
and follow the mysterious and complicated protocol (April? 1993?).

As Erkka Varjo says, "When adding to list, please state which
standards (i.e. NTSC/PAL-M/PAL-N/SECAM) each outlet is able to offer.
That way each and every European doesn't have to write to the
mail-order places in US to ask that and vice versa." Also, info on
rentals and Beta/LD would be useful.

Sections are: New Additions, Mail-order, Magazines, Books, Posters,
Archives, Laserdisc Specialists. Page through to the next section with
^G on most newsreaders.

HARDBOILED (subtitled, letterboxed) $6.99 [peterc]

Eccentri-cinema
One-Five Greta Street
West Haven CT 06516

Eccentri-Cinema transfers almost all of their videos from 16 or 35mm.
Unfortunately, this doesn't hold true for many of the Asian titles
because the films are difficult to get.  Their Asian masters, however,
usually come from 16 or 35mm.  The quality is usually excellent.  Three
titles I received (of about 250) are poor quality, but it is noted in
the catalog that these films are rare, so the quality suffers because
of lack of availability.  These titles are BLAST OF THE IRON PALM,
SEX AND ZEN AND THE ORGY OF SCREAMING VIXENS, and HARDBOILED.  Nearly
all of their videos are $15 with the exception of most of the Asian
titles ($20) and the following films ...  AMUCK! - $17,  BLOOD AND
LACE - $17,  BREAKFAST AT THE MANCHESTER MORGUE (uncut) - $17,
SOUND OF HORROR - $17,  DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON - $17,  HOUSE OF
WHIPCORD - $29,  CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST - $14,  JUNGLE HOLOCAUST - $17,

I have ordered about 200 movies from NYUE, and about 12 - 15 I sent
back.  Sometimes the very top portion of the picture will not track.
The result is an annoying wiggle in the top part of the frame.
Sometimes the catalog indicates that the movie is sub-titled when it
isn't.  Overall, I have been pleased, and the service is EXCELLENT!
NYUE dupes all of their films, but the quality is usually pretty good.

Video Search of Miami dupes all of their videos, and the quality is
generally very poor.  Don't waste your money if you can find the titles
elsewhere.  Also, you don't get packaging ... just the regular video-
cassette box (from Certron or some other low-quality videotape).  I am,
however, very impressed by their catalog.  They have some nearly
impossible-to-find titles like THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED (1970), DEMONIA,
a rare Lucio Fulci film, CRAZY BLOOD, and much more.  The cost of all
of their videos is $25 plus a one-time charge of $10 ... a bit steep
for dupes! - peterc

Re/Search #10: Incredibly Strange Films, edited by V. Vale and Andrea

Andrea Juno and Boyd Rice (Re/Search 10: Incredibly Strange Films) are
ARTISTS: they go out of their way in their quest for unusual
stimulation and take great delight in discovering gems overlooked by
the common horde.  I'm not saying any one approach is "right," just
trying to sum up attitudes toward the material.  It's an interesting
experience to read all three reviews of "Plan 9 From Outer Space" for
instance . . .

  (The New Edition)
   Kim Newman
   Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd. 1988 ISBN 0-7475-0295-1

All of these are in paperback; the Newman book may have been released
in hardcover at some time, but I've only seen it in paper.  The first
three are mostly devoted to short reviews of zillions of films, which
will at least give you a notion of the content, if not of their
artistic merit and actual scariness (which of course is a pretty
subjective thing anyway).  _Nightmare Movies_ is more a history of the
genre, and is divided into chapters according to basic themes (e.g.
zombie flicks, psychos, vampires, basically bizarre, etc.); the author
sticks to films since 1960 or so, and the edition I have goes up to
1988.  Even if you don't wind up finding any gems, they're all quite
entertaining to read.  - mvburke@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (mary virginia
burke)

For a good history of this kind of stuff, you can also try "Splatter
Movies" by John McCarty. It's a good overview of the history of the
genre. Also good by him is his history of cinematic madmen, "Psychos".
I just wish that these had better bindings, because the dang things
keep falling apart on me after about a year, whether I read them or
not.  The cover comes off, and then pages start to fall out. AARRGGHH!

[peterme@ocf.berkeley.edu (Peter Merholz)]

   part of REVIEW: Cult Movies, by Danny Peary
Cult Movies is an interesting read; full of information, anecdotes, serious
review. It covers a wide range of films touching upon most major film-genres.
Those purchasing this book and expecting to find synopsis' and reviews of
cheapie SF and slasher films will be disappointed. Peary's emphasis is on
"Art" films and movie classics like "Casablanca" or "The Searchers". In this
age of *Fast-food Video* people tend to forget the more classical definition
of Cult Movies which encompassed films which developed a devoted, basically
word-of-mouth following long after their initial release. These are not
films which get wide exposure in theatres (with some exceptions) but ones
that went on to develop their second-wind in art and revival houses.

			Medved

The Medveds seem to have a "Gosh! Wow!  Movies!" attitude that is
alternately frustrating and endearing.  I guess if I had to pick labels,
the Medveds are REVIEWERS: they tell you whether or not they liked a
particular movie and not much else; Danny Peary (_Cult Movies_) is a
CRITIC: he will not only review the film, but also place it within a
historical and artistic context, and, whether or not he likes it, he will
give credit where (and if) credit is due; 

Midnight Movies by J. Hoberman and Jonathan Rosenbaum. Da Capo Press/Plenum Publishing. ISBN
0-306-80433-6.  As long as I'm mentioning books for the Cult Movie
Library I'll restate my recommendation for Hoberman and Rosenbaum's
_Midnight Movies_.  It's not so much reviews as a look at the reasons
why people go to cult movies and how the whole phenomenon of midnight
movies got started.

From: stame@emunix.emich.edu (Stewart Tame)

And for books that give you that "Cult Flavor" without necessarily
being about cult films, I recommend: The Hollywood Hall of Shame, also
by the Medveds and Hollywood Babylon, by Kenneth Anger.
		
Joe Bob Goes To The Drive In <Vol. 1 and 2>

The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies by Phil Hardy. Harper & Row, ISBN
0-06-096146-5. Large format 400-page book with lots of excellent
stills, and reviews (chronologically arranged) of many, many films.
Mostly US & European. Goes back to silent films, and up to 1984 (in
the edition I have). Reviews are 1-10 paragraphs, depending on the
"importance" of the film. They are generally interesting, and try to
explain significance or innovations in the films, as well as comparing
similar films. Good effort to list directors, producers, stars, etc.

Video Trash & Treasures Vol 1 and 2 by L.A. Morse

These are small cheap paperbacks with no movies posters or stills. The
books are collections of short (1 paragraph) movie reviews, organized
by genre (he calls them "festivals"), with a short essay on each
genre.  The quality of the writing is very high (Morse is a mystery
writer, though I am not familar with his books) and very funny. While
he reviews only mainstream 'B's, the PC crowd will find much to be
righteously offended by. But if you like the kind of movies that seem
to get mentioned on this newsgroup, you'll enjoy the text.
